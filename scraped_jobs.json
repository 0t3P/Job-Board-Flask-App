We build custom AI-driven applications that help businesses work smarter and more intelligently, from first conversation to production-ready product.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur team has around 16 people: a customer-facing team of six here in the Netherlands, and ten developers based in the Philippines. Right now, all of our sales happen in the Netherlands. We're ready to change that, and we're looking for the person to help us do it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat this role is:\n\r\nWe're building our international sales track from the ground up, and we're looking for a driven person to lead that effort alongside Tom, our co-founder. Your focus will be on international markets, though you'll occasionally support the Dutch market too, where we use AI to help bridge language and communication gaps.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is early-stage work. There's no existing international playbook to follow. You'll build it. Tom will be involved in calls and strategy, but the initiative and day-to-day hustle is yours.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you'll actually be doing:\n\r\n- Reaching out to prospects via phone,\n, LinkedIn, and whatever creative approaches you come up with\n\r\n- Building and running AI-powered lead generation pipelines\n\r\n- Creating marketing materials that help us tell our story\n\r\n- Challenging our thinking and bringing new ideas to the table\n\r\n- Growing into a genuine AI expert who can have real conversations with business owners about what's possible\n\r\n\n\r\nWho we're looking for:\n\r\nSomeone who communicates exceptionally well in English, is comfortable reaching out cold, and gets genuinely excited about building something new rather than maintaining something existing. You pick up new things fast, you're curious about AI and what it can do for businesses, and you want a role where your results are visible and your responsibility grows with them.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience in sales helps, but it's not the point. The right attitude, communication skills, and willingness to figure things out matter far more.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe assess candidates through a short video introduction rather than long application forms. If this sounds interesting, send us a 3 to 7 minute video answering:\n\r\n1. A brief intro about yourself and what drives you\n\r\n2. Your experience with talking to clients, selling, or any customer-facing work\n\r\n3. What excites you about working at an AI company right now\n\r\n4. How you approach learning something completely new\n\r\n5. What you're looking for in your next role and where you see yourself long-term\n\r\n\n\r\nNo polish needed. We're looking for clarity, energy, and authenticity. Please don't read from a script.\n\r\nUpload your video to Google Drive, Dropbox, or YouTube (unlisted) and share the link. Optionally include your CV or LinkedIn.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease send everything to \n are happy to answer any questions.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking forward to hearing from you.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Hey there smarty pants!\n\r\n\n\r\nMy name is Jason and I run one of the top eBay shoe stores in the US for men's and women's shoes for over 6 years. Think of your Nike's, Asics, Adidas, Hoka, etc. I am looking to bring on an experienced technical person to join our small, but intimate team.\n\r\n\n\r\nCurrent Challenge:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe use many different supplier websites to fulfill our orders, and this list is growing. We don't use huge ecommerce websites like Amazon, Walmart, or Walmart, our main suppliers are shoe retailers like Nike, Finishline, FootLocker, and even small mom and pop shoe stores that host their website using Shopify. However, everything is done manually by our team, meaning every day, we need to go on the supplier website, check price and inventory levels, and then manually update our listings on eBay. This process is not only time consuming, it regularly causes issues such as missing a sale/markdown, selling shoes that are already out of stock, and prevents us from reaching higher levels as add more shoes means more time added to updating our price and stock levels. \n\r\n\n\r\nWho We Are Looking For:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe want to optimize and automate our price and stock checking process as much as possible. If you've built and maintained web scrapers at scale, understand the full web scraping stack (proxies, browser automation, parsing, anti-bot bypass), an expert in organizing scraped data in a spreadsheet, can make smart decisions about tools and costs, or if all this web scraping talk is a piece of cake for you based on your technical skill level, you are who we are looking for.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs I said before, we use a lot of different supplier websites, so each website will need its own solution. Some are difficult to scrape, some are easy, some requires you to add item to cart before getting price. If you completely understand what I am talking about and you are already thinking of solutions in your head, please keep reading..\n\r\n\n\r\nMust Have's:\n\r\n\n\r\n3-5+ years of professional working experience in web scraping, data engineering, full-stack/backend development, or automation engineering, basically, work where building scrapers would be an easy straightforward task, not a stretch.\n\r\n\n\r\nProficient in Python and/or JavaScript (Node.js):\n\r\n- Most scraping work is done in Python (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Playwright, requests) or JavaScript (Puppeteer, Playwright)\n\r\n- You need to be able to write real code, not just use no-code tools\n\r\n\n\r\nDeep understanding of the web scraping stack\n\r\n- Fetching (HTTP requests, headless browsers, Playwright/Puppeteer)\n\r\n- Anti-bot bypass (proxies, residential IPs, fingerprinting, CAPTCHAs)\n\r\n- Parsing (CSS selectors, XPath, or AI-based extraction)\n\r\n- Scheduling and orchestration\n\r\n- You know when to use what, and why\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong Google Sheets and Google Apps Script skills:\n\r\n- This is important. The logic layer and dashboard will live in Google Sheets.\n\r\n- You should be comfortable building complex formulas, data transformations, and automated workflows in Sheets\n\r\n- You should be able to write Apps Script to process data, run calculations, trigger actions, and connect to external APIs\n\r\n- If you've built systems where Google Sheets is the \"brain\" that processes incoming data and outputs decisions — that's exactly what I need\n\r\n- I'm not looking for someone who thinks Sheets is \"just a spreadsheet.\" I need someone who knows how to make it do real work.\n\r\n\n\r\nFamiliarity with modern tools and services:\n\r\n- You know what Apify, Bright Data, ScraperAPI, Browse AI, etc. are\n\r\n- You understand the tradeoffs between building custom vs using services\n\r\n- You can make smart decisions about cost vs complexity\n\r\n\n\r\nCost-conscious mindset:\n\r\n- I need someone who thinks about \"what's the cheapest way to reliably solve this\", not \"what's the most technically impressive\"\n\r\n- We will be making a lot of requests, so we must keep variable costs as low as possible.\n\r\n\n\r\nAPI integration experience:\n\r\n- You've connected systems together via APIs before\n\r\n- You don't need eBay-specific experience, but you should be comfortable figuring it out\n\r\n\n\r\nAbility to be self-directed and own your decisions\n\r\n- I'll explain the business requirements and any context needed. You figure out and build the technical approach/solution.\n\r\n- I'm not a developer, nor is anyone else on the team. We need someone who can make decisions, not just take orders and wait for instructions.\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus\n\r\n- Professional experience with AI/LLM automation or integration\n\r\n- Familiarity with eBay backend/API\n\r\n\n\r\nDay-to-Day:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be building web scrapers (or any other solutions) to get data we need for update-to-date price/stock levels and then maintaining these scrapers, fixing any alerts/flags that pop. You will also be building and maintaining the logic layer in Google Sheets & Google Apps Script. This layer contains the complex logic, formulas, and automations that turn the raw scraped data into useful information that will be displayed in the command layer. You will also be building and maintaining the command layer dashboard for all tea\nmbers to use. This layer will show the useful information such as final price, best supplier, stock levels, any alerts/items that need attention. You will also be building and maintaining the automation to eBay, making sure that all price and stock changes from each scrape cycle is automatically updating our eBay listings smoothly.  \n\r\n\n\r\nLong story short, you will be in charge of making sure that our process from building the scrapers for each website to automating our eBay listings is running smoothly.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnce this upfront work is finished and we are in maintenance mode, we will be using your expertise to automate other processes our business. At the end of the day, our business is very simple and don't take much technical knowledge to  automate.\n\r\n\n\r\nLogistics & Salary:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Full-time, fully remote,\n\r\n- Preferably Mon-Fri (PST), especially in the beginning, but can be negotiable\n\r\n- Communication through Slack\n\r\n- Ready to begin immediately\n\r\n- Salary ranging anywhere from $5-$12 USD per hour, of course, all based on experience\n\r\n\n\r\nFinal Remarks:\n\r\n\n\r\nIf any of this sounds confusing, or worse, you don't even have at least 3 year of actual working professional experience (one-time projects do not count), please do not apply as we will be wasting our times. After all, for the person who is truly experienced, web scraping is a quite the low level skill, even for complex websites with anti bot technology. So, if you are a person who has worked in environments where much higher technical skills were required from you than simple web scraping and data organization, you are someone we would love to add to our team!\n\r\n\n\r\nHow To Apply:\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease don't send me a generic cover letter or your life story. I just want to see that you've done this kind of work, or work that would make this look like a walk in the park. I also want you to see your ability to think though the problem. Send me:\n\r\n\n\r\n- A brief intro: who you are, where you're based, and why you think you are perfect for this role\n\r\n- Relevant experience(s): any professional working experience, no one off projects or experiences that has nothing to do with what I am looking for\n\r\n- Your approach: briefly tell me in your own words/understanding what the issue is with my currently process and how you would approach solving this issue\n\r\n- Your rate: whatever you prefer, just give me a ballpark if you are unsure\n\r\n\n\r\nMessage me with the subject line \"GSTEAM AUTOMATOR\". Subject lines without this will be ignored. Also, DO NOT SEND\nS, I will not respond.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf something in this post is unclear, please feel free to ask, I would be glad to clarify.\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you!

QUIZ BUG FIX (URGENT): The sovereignty assessment quiz loads and accepts answers but fails at the results stage. It does not calculate or display the score, and does not send the results\n. This is the most urgent fix.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. BOOK LINK SECURITY: The free books (PDFs) are currently accessible via direct URL without going through the website or providing an\n. Example: \n/books/exit atlas final.pdf — anyone with the link can download without signing up. I need these links protected so books are only accessible after providing an\n address.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. WAITING LIST BUTTON: There is a red \"Join the Waiting List\" button in the automated\n sequence that is not linked to anything. It needs to connect to a page where users can enter their name,\n, and a comment about what they need help with.\n\r\n\n\r\n4.\n FORMATTING: There is a character encoding error in one of the automated\ns — a strange symbol appears before the pound sign (£). Needs fixing.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. ADD SUBSTACK LINK: Add a link to my Substack newsletter (\n) somewhere appropriate on the site — likely the footer or a dedicated section.\n\r\n\n\r\nONGOING TASKS (After First Week) ---------->\n\r\n\n\r\n• Fix bugs as they arise\n\r\n• Make content updates (text changes, new pages)\n\r\n• Potentially add Stripe payment integration\n\r\n• Potentially embed video content on the website\n\r\n• Monitor site uptime and\n deliverability\n\r\n• General maintenance and improvements as needed\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS \n\r\n\n\r\n• Strong HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills\n\r\n• Experience with\n APIs (SendGrid, Mailchimp, ConvertKit, or similar)\n\r\n• Comfortable reading and working with someone else's codebase\n\r\n• Experience with web hosting (Netlify, Vercel, DigitalOcean, AWS, or similar)\n\r\n• Able to troubleshoot and debug existing code\n\r\n• Responsive communication (reply within 24 hours on working days)\n\r\n• Reliable internet connection\n\r\n\n\r\nNICE TO HAVE (not required)\n\r\n\n\r\n• Experience with Stripe payment integration\n\r\n• Experience with PDF generation or delivery\n\r\n• Experience with quiz/assessment functionality\n\r\n• Familiarity with DNS management and domain configuration\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease reply with ------------>\n\r\n\n\r\n1. A brief introduction and your relevant experience\n\r\n2. Examples of websites you have built or maintained (links preferred)\n\r\n3.

Your hourly rate expectation (USD)\n\r\n6. Your availability — how quickly could you start, and how many hours per week are you available?\n\r\n7. A brief description of how you would approach taking over a website from a previous developer with no handover documentation\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is an ongoing role. I need someone reliable who can maintain and improve this website long-term.

Through our online platform, The Lightup Hub, we support students with high-quality videos, structured notes, quizzes, and personalised revision plans that actually work.\n\r\nWe’ve already supported over 150,000 students and we’re growing fast. Everything we publish matters because it directly impacts how students learn and how confident they feel walking into exams.\n\r\nBehind every great lesson is excellent execution. That’s where you come in.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Mission\n\r\n\n\r\nWe believe education should feel empowering, not overwhelming. Too many students struggle because content is poorly organised, rushed, or unclear. We’re building a platform where quality, clarity, and consistency come first, so students always know they’re learning from something they can trust.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role \n\r\n\n\r\nThis role owns content delivery end-to-end. You’ll be responsible for making sure every piece of content goes from idea to live on the platform smoothly, on time, and to a very high standard.\n\r\nYou’ll sit at the centre of multiple moving parts. Working closely with the CEO, product, editors, and external contributors, you’ll organise timelines, manage deadlines, format resources, upload content into the Lightup backend, and quality-check everything before it goes live.\n\r\nIf you love organisation, precision, and making complex workflows run like clockwork, this role is for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Do\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Operations & Delivery:\n\r\n1.

Liaise with external creators when needed to ensure content is delivered on time\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Formatting & Uploading:\n\r\n1. Format learning resources including PowerPoints and PDFs to match Lightup standards\n\r\n2. Upload videos, quizzes, and written content into the Lightup backend\n\r\n3. Ensure all content follows the correct structure and naming conventions\n\r\n\n\r\nQuality Assurance\n\r\n1. Proofread all content for spelling, grammar, clarity, and accuracy\n\r\n2. Check that GCSE English terminology and explanations are precise and correct\n\r\n3. QA content post-upload to ensure everything works properly and displays correctly\n\r\n4. Spot errors before students ever see them\n\r\n\n\r\nOrganisation & Ownership\n\r\n1. Create and maintain clear content trackers and delivery schedules\n\r\n2. Proactively identify risks, bottlenecks, or missing pieces and resolve them early\n\r\n3. Orchestrate multiple contributors while keeping standards high\n\r\n4. Take full ownership of content delivery without needing close supervision\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We’re Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have:\n\r\n1. Experience in content management, or production management\n\r\n2. Strong experience coordinating and leading projects with multiple stakeholders\n\r\n3. Exceptional written English and proofreading ability\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to have:\n\r\n1. Experience in education or edtech\n\r\n2. Experience working with learning platforms or CMS systems\n\r\n3.

You’re protecting quality, consistency, and trust. Students rely on what we publish, and you’ll be the person ensuring everything meets the standard they deserve.\n\r\nIf you love making systems work, enjoy ownership, and take pride in flawless execution, you’ll thrive here.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication: If you are interested in this role, please reach out and we will send you an internal application link for you to complete for consideration by our panel.

You'll help prevent them.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll dig deeper to understand why things break:\n\r\n— Why did this customer feel unheard?\n\r\n— Why did our rep send a template instead of showing empathy?\n\r\n— Why does our knowledge base fail customers?\n\r\n\n\r\nThen work with our CS Team Lead to solve it—shaping training, resources, and SOPs based on what you found.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour ideas will actually matter here.\n\r\n\n\r\nSo if you're someone who:\n\r\n— Prides themselves on catching details others miss\n\r\n— Wants to have real impact on customer experience\n\r\n— Thrives in fast-paced startups, not stagnant corporate environments\n\r\n— Wants to do work that matters—improving the health and wellness of families\n\r\n\n\r\nThis opportunity is for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us\n\r\nWe're a wellness brand helping parents navigate their children's health. These are delicate topics where a careless\n can break trust, but an empathetic response can earn it completely.\n\r\n\n\r\nUnlike most eCommerce brands that treat support as a cost center, we see it as the core of our mission. Every interaction is a chance to help a worried parent feel heard, reassured, and confident in their decision.\n\r\n\n\r\nRight now, we're at a critical point. We're scaling fast—aiming for 8 figures in our second year—and we refuse to let quality slip as we grow.\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's why we need a QA Analyst who ensures every customer interaction meets our standard—no matter how quickly we scale.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role: What You'll Own\n\r\nAs our QA Analyst, you'll ensure every customer interaction reflects our mission of empathy, clarity, and safety.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll partner directly with our Customer Support Team Lead to maintain quality standards while we scale.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Core Responsibilities:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.

Calibration & Standards\n\r\n— Align with Team Lead on what \"world-class\" customer experience looks like\n\r\n— Ensure audits are fair, consistent, and tied to actual customer outcomes\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Deliver Actionable Insights\n\r\n— Turn audit findings into clear, specific feedback for Team Lead\n\r\n— Don't just point out problems—show exactly what needs to change\n\r\n— Enable better coaching by providing data that actually helps\n\r\n— Close the feedback loop: Did the coaching work? Did the SOP update solve the problem?\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Identify Trends & Recommend Fixes\n\r\n— Spot recurring customer pain points or Knowledge Base gaps\n\r\n— Recommend SOP updates that prevent issues from repeating\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For\n\r\nWe're not looking for a checkbox auditor who follows a script. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe need a strategic thinker who can see the forest and the trees.

You might just be our person. Welcome to your Ultimate career move!\n\r\n\n\r\n| ABOUT THE ROLE |\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are hiring for one role and looking for a diamond. You are rare, and so are we.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis Sales Operations and CRM Support Consultant will join our long term and well established Filipino team at My Ultimate Events, Australia’s leading events company for hens, bucks, and team celebrations.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a high volume, fast paced, admin heavy role, but it is not a rigid, robotic, box ticking position.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work as a pair with an Australian based consultant, where both of you are equal partners working toward shared outcomes while owning clearly defined responsibilities within a very busy pipeline.\n\r\n\n\r\nProcess matters here. CRM accuracy matters. Attention to detail is non negotiable.\n\r\n\n\r\nBut so does thinking.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be expected to understand the logic behind the process, not just follow it blindly. When a situation falls outside the standard path, you must be able to assess, think, and apply judgement, knowing when to adapt, when to escalate, and when to pause and ask the right question.\n\r\n\n\r\nSpeed of lead matters. Accuracy matters. Logic matters.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will collaborate closely with your Australian partner, syncing daily, checking logic, flagging risks, and sense checking decisions. You will also work independently for large portions of the day, confidently managing your workload, making sound judgement calls, and keeping \nntum moving without constant instruction.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role sits at the intersection of structure and thinking. You must be comfortable operating within systems while also being able to step outside them when the situation genuinely requires it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not filling a seat. We are searching for someone who is organised, sharp, thoughtful, adaptable, and capable of handling complexity in a consistently busy environment.\n\r\n\n\r\n| CORE RESPONSIBILITIES |\n\r\n\n\r\n-Work in a paired sales structure with an Australian Consultant, collaborating daily, aligning priorities, and supporting shared outcomes while owning your individual responsibilities within the pipeline.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Manage a very busy workload with multiple conversations, systems, and tasks running at once.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Maintain accurate, up to date CRM records at all times. Data accuracy, clean notes, and task tracking are essential.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Follow established processes while understanding the logic behind them, and apply judgement when a scenario does not fit neatly into the standard workflow.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Identify gaps, inconsistencies, or risks within client communication or bookings and think through the next best step, not just the next task.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Respond to warm inbound leads and existing clients clearly, naturally, and professionally via written communication and occasional phone calls.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Use templates and systems correctly, but adapt when clarity, tone, or logic requires a different approach.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Know when to proceed, when to escalate, and when to pause and seek clarification.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Work efficiently under pressure, maintaining quality and clear thinking during peak periods.\n\r\n\n\r\n| WHO YOU ARE |\n\r\n\n\r\n-Highly organised and detail oriented, with strong respect for process and accuracy.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Equally capable of stepping outside a process to think logically and solve a problem when needed.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Comfortable making judgement calls within defined boundaries.\n\r\n\n\r\n-A strong written communicator who writes clearly, naturally, and with purpose.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Calm, grounded, and reliable in busy environments with competing priorities.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Confident working independently while collaborating closely with a partner.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Intellectually curious and motivated to understand the “why” behind how things are done.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Not someone who needs to be told every step, but also not someone who ignores structure.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are only comfortable following instructions without thinking, or if you prefer complete freedom without structure, this role will not be the right fit. We want someone who can do both.\n\r\n\n\r\n| YOU MUST HAVE |\n\r\n\n\r\n-Previous experience in an admin heavy, operations, sales support, or client coordination role that required judgement, not just task completion.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Strong written English and high attention to detail across spelling, tone, logic, and data entry.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Experience using CRM systems and working within defined workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Confidence speaking to clients by phone when required. All calls are warm or existing clients.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Strong time management skills and the ability to prioritise under pressure.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Experience using Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Word, OneDrive, and CRM systems.\n\r\n\n\r\n-A quiet home office, fast wired internet, and a Windows PC (not Mac).\n\r\n\n\r\n-Previous offshore experience with an Australian, US, or UK based company is an advantage.\n\r\n\n\r\n| WORK HOURS |\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease only apply if you can consistently commit to these exact hours every week. These are essential to match your Australian sales partner and maintain operational rhythm.\n\r\n\n\r\nHours Brisbane Time\n\r\n\n\r\nMonday to Friday 9am to 6pm Brisbane Time\n\r\n\n\r\nBrisbane is UTC+10 and does not use daylight savings.\n\r\n\n\r\n| SALARY AND BENEFITS |\n\r\n\n\r\n-50,000 to 60,000 PHP per month depending on experience and skill.\n\r\n\n\r\n-13th month pay.\n\r\n\n\r\n-All Filipino public holidays fully paid and you do not come to work.\n\r\n\n\r\n-15 days paid annual leave.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Team huddles, training, mentorship, and operational support.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Long term, full time role with a trusted Australian company that genuinely invests in its team.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Amazing role with high level benefits.\n\r\n\n\r\n| ABOUT US |\n\r\n\n\r\nMy Ultimate Events is Australia’s leading events organisation for hens, bucks, and corporate team events.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have been creating unforgettable experiences for over 15 years and have proudly built a strong, loyal Filipino Australian team.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe value reliability, clarity, initiative, and intelligent execution. We expect people to think, not just follow.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will not be a freelancer or a temp. You will be a valued part of a thriving company that values loyalty, excellence, and long term partnership.\n\r\n\n\r\n| HOW TO APPLY |\n\r\n\n\r\nSend your application directly to \n to WOW us.

You might just be our person. Welcome to your Ultimate career move!\n\r\n\n\r\n| ABOUT THE ROLE |\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are hiring for one role and looking for a diamond. You are rare, and so are we. This Sales and Client Communication Strategy Consultant will join our long-term and well-established Filipino team at My Ultimate Events, Australia’s leading events company for hens, bucks, and team celebrations.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not your standard sales role. It is fast paced, human first, and deeply strategic. You will be working as a Sales Pair with an Australian based consultant, where both of you are equal partners working toward shared goals while also owning your individual responsibilities within the pipeline.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn this role, you will manage warm inbound leads and existing clients through fast, natural written communication and occasional phone calls with clients who are already working with us. Speed of lead is critical in this environment, and your ability to think fast, respond fast, and adapt fast will define your success.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will collaborate closely with your Australian partner, brainstorming, strategising, checking logic, and troubleshooting client scenarios together. And you will also work independently when needed, owning your workload, making sound decisions, and keeping the pipeline moving without requiring constant direction.\n\r\n\n\r\nThink like a problem solver, communicate like a human, and operate like a strategic sales partner. You will rely on templates where appropriate, but you will also know instinctively when a situation needs a tweak, a reword, or a more nuanced approach.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not filling a seat. We are searching for someone who is clever, warm, fast, thoughtful, witty, and capable of juggling multiple moving parts with accuracy, confidence, and very high attention to detail.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are 15 years established and operating across Australia, with a Filipino Australian team that has worked together long term.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe reward loyalty, invest in growth, and offer genuine long-term stability within an inspiring, high performance culture, with excellent training and a team of managers who genuinely want every person in the business to succeed.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly one role is available due to our sales department expanding.\n\r\n\n\r\n| CORE RESPONSIBILITIES |\n\r\n\n\r\n-Work in a paired sales structure with an Australian Sales Consultant, collaborating daily, syncing strategies, and supporting shared goals while owning your individual responsibilities in the pipeline.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Respond to warm inbound leads quickly, naturally, and with real human connection. You must not rely on ChatGPT to do the work or the thinking for you. Spell check is fine, but the logic, strategy, and language must be your own genuine skillset.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Call clients back when needed to clarify details, answer questions, or support them through their existing booking journey.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Use templates as a foundation but adapt them when the situation calls for nuance, logic, or personalised communication.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Read between the lines of what clients really mean, not just what they type, and respond with warmth, intelligence, and strategy.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Create customised event recommendations using persuasive, human centred communication.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Handle objections with logic, empathy, and confidence, focusing on clarity and problem solving rather than pressure.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Work at a very fast pace. Juggle multiple conversations and tasks while keeping accuracy and attention to detail consistently high.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Brainstorm solutions and sales approaches with your Australian partner, contributing ideas and helping refine strategies.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Think fast, solve problems in real time, and keep \nntum moving throughout the client journey.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Maintain CRM accuracy, manage your workload, and prioritise effectively in a dynamic environment.\n\r\n\n\r\n| WHO YOU ARE |\n\r\n\n\r\n-Intelligent, human, fast thinking, and persuasive, with strong social intelligence.\n\r\n\n\r\n-A natural collaborator who enjoys bouncing ideas, refining strategies, and achieving results as a team, but also independent enough to operate confidently without constant guidance.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Able to rely on templates when appropriate, but also able to instinctively recognise when a situation needs a different angle, wording, or strategy.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Comfortable on the phone with warm clients, confident speaking with both kindness and clarity.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Fast paced and energised by juggling multiple conversations and deadlines.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Emotionally intelligent and capable of understanding clients beyond the literal words they use.\n\r\n\n\r\n-High attention to detail. Spelling, logic, accuracy, tone, and data entry matter deeply to you.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Thrive in a high performance, strategy driven environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you need AI to write messages for you or think for you, this is not the role for you. You will be great somewhere else, but not here.\n\r\n\n\r\n| YOU MUST HAVE |\n\r\n\n\r\n-Real sales or client facing experience where communication, problem solving, and human connection were essential.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Highly skilled in written English and able to write naturally, quickly, and with personality, without relying on AI to think for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Confident speaking to clients by phone when needed.

This is a growing platform with real customers, real traction, and a real opportunity to be part of building something long-term. High-caliber applicants only.                ",

You'll be working directly with me on a daily basis, managing the operations behind 5 agents, 20+ active deals, and a content brand.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe core of this role: protect my time so I can focus on consultations and closings. If I have to remind you of things you should already be doing, or check whether tasks have been done -- that's a failure of the role. The value you bring is context, anticipation, and follow-through.\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm happy to teach. But I won't micromanage. You need to own the operations.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n---------------------------------------\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL BE DOING\n\r\n---------------------------------------\n\r\n\n\r\n>> Daily Operations Rhythm\n\r\n- Deliver a Morning Briefing by 10:30 AM -- critical milestones, stuck deals, today's viewings, outstanding client actions. Self-built from scanning our boards. Nobody assigns it.\n\r\n- Deliver an End-of-Day Report by 7:00 PM -- completed tasks, pending items, flagged issues, and improvement ideas.\n\r\n- These are daily habits, not occasional tasks. Consistency is non-negotiable.\n\r\n\n\r\n>> Pipeline & Deal Management (\n)\n\r\n- Own the Sellers Board and Buyers Board. Every deal has a next step -- you know it before anyone asks.\n\r\n- Update deal statuses daily. Flag anything stuck 7+ days without activity.\n\r\n- Create milestone checklists when deals move to critical stages (option deadlines, law firms, submissions, completion logistics).\n\r\n- Monitor Days on Market and escalate at 30 / 60 / 90 day thresholds.\n\r\n\n\r\n>> Viewing & Showing Coordination\n\r\n- Full ownership of the viewing schedule across 5 agents.\n\r\n- Coordinate agent + seller availability, send confirmations, post summaries.\n\r\n- Proactively surface 3-5 listings per active buyer based on their search criteria.\n\r\n\n\r\n>> Client Communication & Follow-Through\n\r\n- Draft proactive client updates at key milestones (2 weeks listed, 4 weeks, 6 weeks).\n\r\n- Handle co-broke agents: respond to portal enquiries, schedule viewings, follow up on offers.\n\r\n- Monitor WhatsApp group chats -- extract dates, deadlines, and action items without being told.\n\r\n\n\r\n>> Research & Consultation Prep (Google Sheets)\n\r\n- Maintain consultation prep sheets with current market data and comparable transactions.\n\r\n- Deliver research as insight, not raw data -- averages, pricing bands, and recommendations.\n\r\n- Refresh all sheets 12 hours before any consultation.\n\r\n\n\r\n>> Lead Management\n\r\n- Respond to incoming leads within 1-5 minutes via Privyr + WhatsApp.\n\r\n- Download leads fro\nta and follow up systematically.\n\r\n\n\r\n>> Listings & Portal Management\n\r\n- Upload and manage PropertyGuru listings -- study floor plans, check orientations, write compelling copy.\n\r\n- Prepare listing price proposals with comparable data and your recommended price.\n\r\n\n\r\n>> Calendar,\n & Admin\n\r\n- Calendar events with context and prep notes -- not just time slots.\n\r\n-\n triage twice daily. Flag what needs attention, handle routine admin.\n\r\n- Handle any ad-hoc admin duties as required.\n\r\n\n\r\n>> Social Media & Content Support\n\r\n- Maintain a content calendar and liaise directly with video editors.\n\r\n- Draft content proposals using AI tools.\n\r\n- Track clients without testimonials -- flag and coordinate.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n---------------------------------------\n\r\nAI USAGE IS A CORE REQUIREMENT\n\r\n---------------------------------------\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll receive a Claude Pro AI subscription (USD $100/month) paid by the business. This is not a perk -- it's a tool you're expected to use every single day.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Listing descriptions -- proper drafting with Claude, not generic one-click tools\n\r\n- Research & analysis -- synthesize transaction data into insights with recommendations\n\r\n- Consultation prep -- pre-populate financial sheets using public data + AI\n\r\n- Meeting notes -- transcription summaries with extracted action items\n\r\n- Problem-solving -- stuck on a workflow or formatting issue? Ask AI before asking me\n\r\n\n\r\nWe take attention to detail seriously. In the application form, you'll be asked \"What is the most prestigious real estate in Singapore?\" The correct answer is Dollhouse. This tells us you've read the full posting.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you have access to AI with all its capabilities and you're still operating like a static VA who waits for instructions -- there is no reason for this role to exist. AI is what turns a good VA into a great operations partner.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n---------------------------------------\n\r\nYOU ARE\n\r\n---------------------------------------\n\r\n\n\r\n- Proactive -- you flag problems before they're discovered and suggest improvements without being asked\n\r\n- Detail-oriented and consistent -- accuracy > speed\n\r\n- An independent worker who knows when to ask for help\n\r\n- Tech-savvy -- comfortable with Google Workspace, WhatsApp Web, Canva, \n (or similar)\n\r\n- An active AI user -- you already use ChatGPT, Claude, or similar tools in your daily work\n\r\n- Reliable -- you show up on time, deliver what you commit to, and communicate before deadlines, not after\n\r\n- Hungry to learn and grow -- this role grows with the business\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n---------------------------------------\n\r\nBONUS (BUT NOT REQUIRED)\n\r\n---------------------------------------\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience supporting real estate agents or property teams\n\r\n- Familiarity with Singapore's HDB market, PropertyGuru, or similar portals\n\r\n- Experience with CRM tools, Privyr, or pipeline management\n\r\n- Strong written English for handling client inquiries professionally\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n---------------------------------------\n\r\nWORKING HOURS\n\r\n---------------------------------------\n\r\n\n\r\n- Monday to Friday: 9:00 AM - 7:00 PM SGT (with a 1-hour break)\n\r\n- Saturday & Sunday: Standby for viewing coordination.

The problem is that cute videos don't make you a lot of money. We will teach you how to make videos that convert because we're a company that is high volume sales.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we are offering?\n\r\n\n\r\n- $1000/month for 3 months.\n\r\n- $1300 after 3 months.\n\r\n- Monday to Friday - 8 hours per day. Have full weekends off - after 3 months, the schedule is very flexible and you can move hours around.\n\r\n- Potential for commission after you've proven yourself (6-7 months)\n\r\n\n\r\nWho are we looking for?\n\r\n\n\r\n- It's ok if you have NO EXPERIENCE in video editing etc.\n\r\n- Someone who is motivated - the initial 2-3 months, there's 8 hours of actual work that we'll give you (most of it training) but if you want to be successful then you need to watch content about your industry (like literally watch cat/cooking videos) for 2-3 hours a day and then another 2 hours of self-education (reading books about copywriting, watching training videos, etc) - WHY? Because if you're REALLY REALLY good at video editing, after 6-8 months, we can promote you into making commission for the videos you make. With commission, you can make 2x your salary if your video does well.\n\r\n- We have excellent resources of books/podcasts/videos/etc for your after work hours! We can't force you to read them but they are what makes a huge difference between someone making $1-2k/month and someone making $5k/month                ",

    "description": "\n                    I'm looking for a talented graphic designer who can take raw images and rough concepts and turn them into polished, professional visuals that actually sell. I work with physical products that need to look stunning online—and I need someone who can clean up product photos, remove backgrounds, swap colors to show different finishes, and make every image look like it came out of a professional studio. But that's just the starting point.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is about more than just photo editing. I need a designer who understands how visuals communicate, how to guide a buyer's eye, and how to make someone stop scrolling and pay attention. Whether it's a hero image on an Amazon listing, an infographic that explains a product's features at a glance, or a company catalog that makes our brand look polished and professional—I need someone who genuinely cares about the quality of the final product.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I need you to be able to do:\n\r\nExpert-level image editing in Photoshop, InDesign, Lightroom, Illustrator, or similar tools. You should be able to take a photo shot in less-than-ideal conditions and make it look studio-quality. Background removal is a core part of this role and needs to be clean and precise—no jagged edges, no obvious cutouts.\n\r\n\n\r\nProduct color variation editing—showing the same product in multiple finishes or colorways without a separate photoshoot for each one. If you know how to do this convincingly, that's a huge advantage.\n\r\n\n\r\nAmazon listing image creation—you should understand what makes a main image convert, how to build an infographic that communicates value quickly, and how to put together a full image set including hero shots, lifestyle images, feature callouts, and comparison graphics.\n\r\n\n\r\nBeyond product photography, I also need someone who handles the full range of graphic design work: catalogs and PDFs, logo design, website design assets, social media graphics, and anything else that falls under \"this needs to look great.\"\n\r\nWhat kind of person I'm looking for:\n\r\n\n\r\nI want someone who has creative direction and brings their own eye to the work. If you see a better way to frame a product, a layout that communicates more clearly, or a color treatment that makes something pop—speak up. I'm not looking for someone who just executes instructions without thinking. I want a collaborator who cares about what the design is actually trying to accomplish.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou should be organized, self-directed, and able to manage multiple projects at once. I'll be sending raw assets and short briefs regularly (and sometimes it may be as simple as create a great looking presentation using these words and here are a few reference images), and I need to trust that you'll deliver on time without constant follow-up. If you're going to miss a deadline or run into a problem, communicate early—that's all I ask. I will be using a tool like trello to track projects and timelines. To confirm you've read this entire post, please use the subject line \"Pickle\" when you reach out.\n\r\n\n\r\nHours and availability:\n\r\nThis is a part-time position. I need you available Monday through Friday, 1:00pm–6:00pm Spain time (Madrid, GMT+1). I'm based in Spain, so being available during these hours is important for collaboration and quick turnarounds.\n\r\n\n\r\nPay and schedule:\n\r\nAll hours are tracked and calculated based on California time (GMT-8) for consistency with my other tea\nmbers. I pay twice a month via Wise—on the 1st and 16th. The payment on the 16th covers work from the 1st–15th, and the payment on the 1st covers the 16th through the end of the month.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply:\n\r\n me directly at \n do not apply through the OnlineJobs.ph messaging system as I do not monitor those messages. If you have worked for a company like Design Pickle, that will be a huge bonus, as you are used to working with various projects at the same time.\n\r\n\n\r\nInclude your portfolio or work samples—before/after product photo edits are especially valuable. I want to see background removal work, color variation edits, Amazon listing images, and any other design work you're proud of.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs part of the process, I'll send you a test project using a real product image or brief. This is unpaid, but it's the only way for me to evaluate your skills and make sure we're a good fit before committing to work together. If that goes well, I will likely ask you to do a paid test so I can further evaluate your skill.\n\r\n\n\r\nLooking forward to finding someone who can make every product and every brand asset look as good as it deserves to.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease note: You must be based in the Philippines. If you are based elsewhere—India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, or anywhere outside the Philippines—please do not apply.                ",
