We are currently active in The Netherlands and Belgium and expanding across Europe.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Do (Your Core Responsibility)\n\r\nYou will be our dedicated Video Editor for performance ads. Your job is to turn raw creator content into multiple high-converting ad variations for Meta & TikTok on a weekly basis.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT basic video editing.\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who understands direct response marketing and knows how to edit videos that convert.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Weekly Tasks\n\r\n- Edit 5–15 short-form ad videos per week (UGC + lifestyle + product demos)\n\r\n- Create multiple variations from the same raw footage (different hooks, captions, pacing, first 3 seconds, CTAs)\n\r\n- Add subtitles optimized for TikTok & Meta (fast, bold, attention-grabbing)\n\r\n- Cut for retention: strong hooks in the first 1–3 seconds\n\r\n- Follow our creative briefs, examples, and SOP\n\r\n- Deliver on time every week\n\r\n- Implement feedback and iterate on winning creatives\n\r\n- Organize files properly (naming, folders, versions)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe Are Looking For Someone Who\n\r\n- Has experience editing direct response / performance ads\n\r\n- Understands how ads work on Meta & TikTok (hooks, pacing, scroll-stopping edits)\n\r\n- Is detail-oriented and follows instructions carefully\n\r\n- Is proactive: asks questions if something is unclear\n\r\n- Can work independently once the SOP is clear\n\r\n- Can handle weekly production without reminders\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant\n\r\nWe work fast and test a lot of creatives.\n\r\nIf you:\n\r\n- Miss deadlines\n\r\n- Don’t follow instructions\n\r\n- Don’t ask questions when confused\n\r\n- Or deliver inconsistent quality\n\r\n\n\r\nThis will clearly not be a fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nPaid Test Task (Mandatory)\n\r\nBefore we hire you, we will ask you to complete a small paid test assignment (1–2 short ad videos) based on real raw footage and a clear briefing.\n\r\nThis helps both sides see if we’re a good match.\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-Term Opportunity\n\r\nIf this works well, this can become a long-term collaboration with consistent weekly work, growth in responsibility, and higher pay over time.

The goal is to create thoughtful, high-quality nonfiction episodes that feel intelligent, polished, and cohesive while still being optimized for growth and engagement on the platform.\n\r\nThe right person will understand both narrative structure and YouTube performance. You should know how to shape compelling episodes of a docu-series, weaving together talking-to-camera footage with archival clips, photographs, graphics, and other supporting visuals in a way that feels seamless and purposeful. Strong pacing, clarity of storytelling, and an instinct for retention are essential. I’m looking for someone who can help craft episodes that feel elevated and cinematic, but still distinctly “YouTube” in their accessibility and rhythm.\n\r\nThis role requires confidence in sourcing and integrating external media. You should be familiar with reputable stock libraries and archival resources, understand where to find high-quality images and video, and know how to properly incorporate material pulled from platforms like YouTube when appropriate. A working understanding of licensing and fair use principles is important. In addition to editing, you should be comfortable creating clean, professional graphics, lower thirds, and other visual elements that enhance the storytelling without overwhelming it.\n\r\nPrior experience is required. Please be prepared to share links to videos you have worked on, ideally documentary-style or nonfiction projects for YouTube or similar platforms.

I am seeking a reliable partner who can commit between approximately five and 20 hours per week, depending on production needs. The schedule is flexible, but consistency is essential, as episodes will be produced on a weekly basis. Clear communication, dependability, and a shared commitment to quality matter greatly.\n\r\nIf you are someone who values smart storytelling, understands YouTube strategy, and wants to help build a distinctive and ambitious docu-series over time, I would love to hear from you.

I am Half Japanese and half Filipino. I speak fluent Tagalog and English. However, I easily adjust to who I talk to. It is important to know, though, that Reading and writing in English are both separate skills. More on that later on. We can communicate in Tagalog or English. Usually, in\ns, I prefer proper English.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. I am a workaholic. My schedule is hectic, and I have many responsibilities. My current assistant will leave after three years of working with me to pursue her path. She has been excellent in fulfilling her duties and responsibilities. I also found her here on this platform. \n\r\n\n\r\n3. Time is very important to me. I want to add more time and reduce my workload. I want to spend more time with my family when I go home every day. Most of the tasks are personally related. Task-intensive, yes, because there are a lot of small tasks like calls, messages, and research. I value the time that much. I don't want to get sidelined and distracted with my day to day tasks. \n\r\n\n\r\n4. I am a technology-oriented person. You will be introduced to many tools you have probably not heard of before (win-win). Security is another factor. I will try our relationship first before introducing myself further.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. I am more available at night after a busy day's work. I am still trying to assess our workflow. It is more of a let's see what works, and let us communicate properly on how you want things. Usually, I would reply in the morning, and of course reply during the day if a concern is there but if we come to an arrangement wherein we can review the day or plan the next tasks after 7pm or if you are still awake by 10pm then that would be really good.\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Since I am busy, I can be flexible. Maybe there will be some weekdays when I won't need you, or we can transfer it to a Saturday or Sunday.\n\r\n\n\r\nDisclaimer: I am not sure if my job description is really the industry standard, but what I can say is I do not need a highly skilled VA in terms of Wordpress or Marketing. I want someone who is very good with Research and Communication. This is just a heads-up before moving to the next points.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUISITES:\n\r\n1. Proper English (Reading & Writing)\n\r\n2. Mobile Phone (I will provide your own, postpaid number & etc). \n\r\n3. Laptop or Desktop PC (I will provide your own)\n\r\n4. Speed Test of your internet ( I will assess this)\n\r\n5. Typing Test (Words per minute, I use Type Racer)\n\r\n5. Good Communication Skills (This is just my preference, but if you communicate with (....Hello po) and like that, I will ask you to change and improve on that part. Proper punctuation, spelling, and sentence construction will be appreciated.)\n\r\n6. Good Logic and Analytical Skills\n\r\n7. Reading between the lines. (Context of Clues)\n\r\n8. Advance notice is critical to me. I plan my tasks obsessively and schedule my life based on Time. As mentioned, I treat it like I treat it with money.\n\r\n9. Loyalty and Trust.\n\r\n10. I hope you don't mind me messaging you early in the morning or very late at night (mute it) since there are times that I create messages or instructions at these times.\n\r\n11. It would be a plus BUT NOT MANDATORY if you are in the Apple ecosystem (iPhone)\n\r\n\n\r\nMAJOR JOB DESCRIPTION:\n\r\n1. Monitors and Updates my purchases.\n\r\n2.

This position requires deep empathy, exceptional storytelling skills, and a genuine interest in helping our audience solve their problems.

Metrics could include audience engagement, content-driven community growth, and positive feedback. We'll go over those details once you've demonstrated your skills, but you should be comfortable working with just the base pay initially.\n\r\n\n\r\n[What You’ll Be Doing]\n\r\n\n\r\nYour role is to be the voice of our brand, building a bridge of trust between us and our audience. You will be responsible for the end-to-end content creation process, ensuring every piece is valuable, credible, and engaging.

You are passionate about creating content that helps people and represents our company's values authentically.\n\r\n\n\r\ne) Is Proficient with Content & SEO Tools: You are skilled in using tools for research, writing, and basic SEO (e.g., Google Docs, Grammarly, keyword research tools).\n\r\n\n\r\nf) Communicates with Clarity and Values Respect: You are reliable, accountable, and can articulate your thoughts in a clear, logical manner.\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant Note:\n\r\nWe value respectful communication. What does it mean? Most importantly, if you need to step away, just let me or your manager know why and when. We understand it, even if you need to leave tomorrow, BUT ghosting is the last thing you'd like to do, since it causes confusion and delays.

I prefer to work closely with my editors and build long-term creative partnerships.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe reason I’m here today is that I’m looking for a full-time short-form editor to come aboard and help scale our content output.\n\r\n\n\r\nJob Description:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will primarily be editing short-form videos (30 seconds to 3 minutes).\n\r\n\n\r\nThe goal is not “basic caption cutting.” We aim for highly engaging, scroll-stopping edits.\n\r\n\n\r\nVideos must be optimized for retention: fast pacing, dynamic captions, pattern interrupts, zooms, b-roll, sound design, and occasional motion graphics.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong emphasis on hook optimization in the first 1–3 seconds.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be provided with:\n\r\n\n\r\nA script (or structured outline)\n\r\n\n\r\nReference videos\n\r\n\n\r\nBrand guidelines\n\r\n\n\r\nMusic and sound direction\n\r\n\n\r\nWe aim to produce 3–7 short-form videos per week, depending on performance.\n\r\n\n\r\nTurnaround time is fast. You’ll typically work on multiple videos per week rather than one long project.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not just “cutting clips.”\n\r\nWe are engineering content designed to perform algorithmically.\n\r\n\n\r\nEditing Standard:\n\r\n\n\r\nTight pacing (no dead air)\n\r\n\n\r\nCaptions that enhance emotion (not just transcriptions)\n\r\n\n\r\nStrategic zoom-ins and punch-ins\n\r\n\n\r\nSubtle but effective sound design\n\r\n\n\r\nPattern interrupts every 3–7 seconds\n\r\n\n\r\nClean, modern visual style\n\r\n\n\r\nAbility to visually emphasize psychological concepts (diagrams, minimal motion graphics when needed)\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience editing in the relationship/self-help niche is a plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nQualifications:\n\r\n\n\r\nProficient in Adobe Premiere Pro\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong working knowledge of After Effects (basic to intermediate motion graphics)\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong understanding of TikTok/Reels editing trends\n\r\n\n\r\nAbility to think in terms of retention and watch time\n\r\n\n\r\nMust provide a portfolio showcasing short-form work\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus points if you:\n\r\n\n\r\nUnderstand storytelling structure\n\r\n\n\r\nKnow how to build tension in short form\n\r\n\n\r\nCan suggest improvements to hooks                ",

    "description": "\n                    ABOUT US:\n\r\nWe are a well-established e-commerce company with over 10 years of success in the baby products niche, specializing in party supplies. Our brand is powered by a growing team of high-achievers who value ownership, honesty, and continuous improvement. Many of our tea\nmbers have been with us for years and grown into bigger roles. For instance, our manager started as a Virtual Assistant through OnlineJobs.ph nearly 5 years ago and has grown into her leadership role. We are committed to helping you succeed and invest in people who want to grow long-term, not just find “another online job.”\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT THE ROLE:\n\r\nWe are looking for a reliable, detail-oriented, and creative full-time Graphic Designer who takes pride in high-quality work. You will work on product images, simple videos, AI-generated visuals, social media creatives, packaging, and light product design. You don’t need to know every tool yet, what matters most is that you are visually creative, eager to learn, and excited to improve every week. You are comfortable working with autonomy, responding to feedback, and you see this role as a chance to grow your skills and build a long-term career with PRIMEPURE.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role offers semi-flexible hours with weekly calls across time zones and day-to-day work done independently.\n\r\n\n\r\nCORE RESPONSIBILITIES:\n\r\n- Edit and enhance product images for our listings and website (cleanups, simple retouching, basic composites).\n\r\n- Create lifestyle images and simple mockups to showcase our products.\n\r\n- Design social media creatives aligned with our brand.\n\r\n- Assist with product packaging layouts and small product design elements.\n\r\n- Create simple marketing assets such as banners,\n graphics, and promotional visuals.\n\r\n- Use AI tools as part of your creative process (for example, to generate ideas, mockups, or variations) and refine outputs for real-world use.\n\r\n- Organize design files and follow our brand guidelines and templates.\n\r\n- Communicate clearly with the team in writing and on calls, sharing progress and asking smart questions when truly needed.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\r\n- Strong visual sense and creativity: You care about aesthetics, composition, and clear visual communication.\n\r\n- Basic experience with at least one design tool (e.g., Canva, Photoshop, Illustrator, or similar).\n\r\n- Willingness and excitement to learn Photoshop and Illustrator with our guidance.\n\r\n- Highly organized: Strong attention to detail and ability to manage multiple design tasks.\n\r\n- Self-motivated and autonomous: You set mini-deadlines, move work forward without reminders, and keep your commitments.\n\r\n- Research-first mindset: You look for tutorials, inspiration, and examples before asking the team.\n\r\n- Eager to learn: You actively look for feedback, new tools, and better ways to work.\n\r\n\n\r\nDESIRED SKILLS (preferred but not required):\n\r\n- Familiarity with e-commerce or product-based brands (Amazon, Shopify, etc.).\n\r\n- Experience with short-form video editing (reels, TikToks, simple product videos).\n\r\n- Experience creating packaging, labels, or print-ready files.\n\r\n- Experience using tools like Asana, Slack, or similar project-management/communication platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\nBENEFITS:\n\r\n- 100% remote work.\n\r\n- Competitive salary with opportunities for performance-based increases up to twice per year.\n\r\n- Internet bill coverage.\n\r\n- Long-term growth opportunities in a stable, fast-moving company.\n\r\n- Access to training resources and a supportive leadership team that wants you to succeed.\n\r\n\n\r\nNOTE ABOUT USE OF AI:\n\r\nWe actively use and encourage AI tools in our day-to-day work, and we see them as a powerful way to work smarter. However, during the hiring process we ask that you complete all application questions and exercises yourself, without AI assistance. We genuinely want to get to know the real YOU, not a \"perfectly polished, robotic answer\" you. Don’t worry about sentence structure or grammar; what matters to us is the substance of your answers and the honesty behind them. If we believe AI has been used to generate your responses, your application will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY (READ CAREFULLY):\n\r\n- Use this\n subject line exactly: \"I will not use AI\"\n\r\n- At the very top of your\n body, before anything else, write this sentence exactly: \"Hello PRIMEPURE team, I pay attention to small details\"\n\r\n- In the rest of the\n body, in a few short sentences, answer these two questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. What would you want us to remember about you after reading 100 applications? Feel free to attach your portfolio here.\n\r\n2. What are your salary expectations for this position (per month in USD)?\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that do not follow these few simple instructions will sadly not be considered. If shortlisted, you’ll receive an\n from Anna with instructions on the next steps. Thank you for your time, and best of luck!                ",

You will be responsible for generating qualified leads and booking appointments through LinkedIn (in addition to any other service you've had success with) for our AI-powered sales acquisition business. We work with coaches, consultants, and service businesses etc. You will go through a direct onboarding process with company leadership to understand our brands, our offers, and our approach.

Our lowest package nets $1,750. That means your minimum commission per closed deal is $175.

Show us what you have done, not what you think you can do.\n\r\nYour own action plan. Come to the table with a strategy. We want to see how you think and how you operate.\n\r\nStrong written English. You will be reaching out to business owners in the United States. Your communication needs to be sharp.\n\r\n\n\r\nSelf-starter mentality. You will have support, but you will not be micromanaged. If you need someone standing over your shoulder to get work done, this is not the role for you. Hunger. We have built something big, and we want you to go bigger with us. We want someone who wants to build with us and get paid well doing it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU GET\n\r\n\n\r\nDirect onboarding with company leadership so you fully understand the business, the offers, and the positioning across multiple brands\n\r\n\n\r\nA proven offer that converts.

    "description": "\n                    Job Description:\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\nWe're a blockchain/DeFi company running production infrastructure that's bleeding money unnecessarily. Our AWS bill is sitting at $4,500/month – and we know it shouldn't be anywhere near that. We need someone who can come in, audit the whole setup, and actually fix it. Not just give us a report that sits in a folder.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe've already been through a few candidates who talked a big game but couldn't execute. We're done with that. If you're the type who needs handholding or can't work independently, this isn't for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Actually Do\n\r\n- Audit our entire AWS infrastructure and identify exactly where we're wasting money (we expect significant savings)\n\r\n- Optimize our Kubernetes clusters – right-size nodes, fix resource requests/limits, implement autoscaling that actually works\n\r\n- Implement cost controls: Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, spot instances where appropriate, and cleanup of orphaned resources\n\r\n- Set up monitoring and alerts so costs don't creep back up without us knowing\n\r\n- Document everything you do so the team can maintain it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHard Requirements (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n- 3+ years hands-on Kubernetes experience in production environments – EKS specifically preferred\n\r\n- Deep AWS knowledge: EC2, EKS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor\n\r\n- Proven track record of actually reducing AWS costs (be ready to share numbers/percentages)\n\r\n- Strong scripting skills (Python, Bash) for automation\n\r\n- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform or CloudFormation (Terraform preferred)\n\r\n- Self-starter who can take ownership and execute without constant oversight\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n!!!!CRITICAL: This Role Requires Surgical Precision\n\r\nThis is production infrastructure running live systems. Think of this like surgery – one wrong move can take everything down.\n\r\n- NO cowboy moves. You don't delete, modify, or remove anything without a clear plan first.\n\r\n- Every change must be planned out, documented, and confirmed with the CEO before execution.\n\r\n- Extreme attention to detail. You double-check and triple-check before touching anything.\n\r\n- If you're not 100% sure what something does, you ask first. You don't assume.\n\r\n- Methodical execution only. We value careful and correct over fast and reckless.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong Plus\n\r\n- Experience with blockchain/Web3 infrastructure\n\r\n- Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, or KEDA experience\n\r\n-  AWS certifications (Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer)\n\r\n- Experience with FinOps tools (Kubecost, CloudHealth, \n)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Need In Your Application\n\r\nDon't send a generic application. We will ignore it. Include:\n\r\n- Specific examples of AWS cost optimization you've done – what was the setup, what did you change, what % did you save?\n\r\n- Your Kubernetes experience – cluster sizes you've managed, scaling strategies you've implemented\n\r\n- Your availability and timezone (we need someone who can overlap with US business hours for some calls)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Structure\n\r\n- $20-25/hour based on experience and proven results\n\r\n- 20 hours/week to start – potential for more hours for the right person\n\r\n- Fully remote\n\r\n- Initial project: Comprehensive audit + implementation plan with clear cost reduction targets\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're someone who can actually deliver results and not just talk about them – we want to hear from you.

    "description": "\n                    US E-Commerce Company — Garage Storage, Attic Lifts & Access Equipment\n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule: Full-Time, Monday–Friday, 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM or 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM US Eastern Time (40 hours/week)\n\r\nCompensation: $12–$14 USD/hour (based on experience), paid weekly or biweekly\n\r\nStart Date: Immediate / As soon as the right person is found\n\r\nLocation: Remote — Philippines\n\r\n\n\r\n---------- ABOUT US ----------\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a fast-growing US-based e-commerce company specializing in high-ticket residential and commercial products: garage storage systems, attic lifts, motorized stairs, and specialty access equipment. Our customers are a mix of homeowners undertaking renovation projects and construction professionals (contractors, architects, builders) specifying products for their clients.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe finished 2024 at over $2.3 million in revenue and are on pace for $3.6 million in 2026. This is a real, profitable, founder-led business — not a startup burning cash. You would be working directly with the owner and joining a small, high-trust team.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who can become a core part of our growth. This is not a task-based VA role. This is a professional sales support position where your construction knowledge, communication skills, and initiative will directly impact revenue.\n\r\n\n\r\n---------- WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING ----------\n\r\n\n\r\nLead Response & Qualification (50%)\n\r\n• Answer inbound inquiries from homeowners and professionals via phone, live chat, and\n\r\n• Ask the right questions to understand their project: What are they building? What type of roof structure? What are the ceiling/floor dimensions? Do they need installation?\n\r\n• Guide customers through product selection based on their specific construction situation\n\r\n• Provide accurate product specifications, pricing, and shipping timelines\n\r\n• Qualify leads and identify which prospects are ready to buy vs. which need nurturing\n\r\n\n\r\nPipeline Management & Follow-Up (35%)\n\r\n• Own the CRM (HubSpot) — update contact records, log all interactions, move leads through pipeline stages\n\r\n• Systematically follow up with leads who are in a research or decision phase\n\r\n• Maintain regular touchpoints with professional leads on longer sales cycles (weeks to months) — check-ins, quote follow-ups, project timeline updates\n\r\n• Re-engage a backlog of 200+ recent leads who have not been contacted\n\r\n• Ensure no qualified lead falls through the cracks\n\r\n\n\r\nSales Support & Coordination (15%)\n\r\n• Prepare quotes and product recommendations for the owner to review on larger/complex deals\n\r\n• Flag hot leads and escalate to the owner when they are ready to close\n\r\n• Identify patterns in customer questions and suggest improvements to our sales process\n\r\n• Coordinate with our post-sale operations tea\nmber on order handoffs\n\r\n\n\r\n---------- WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR ----------\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Construction industry experience — You must understand basic construction concepts: roof types (truss vs. rafter), framing, joists, ceiling heights, garage dimensions, attic access. This is not something we can easily teach remotely. If a homeowner says \"I have a 2x6 rafter roof with a 10/12 pitch,\" you need to know what that means or learn it very quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\n• Excellent spoken English — You will be on the phone regularly with American homeowners and contractors. Clear pronunciation, natural conversational flow, and the ability to build rapport over the phone are essential. We will conduct an unscripted video/voice interview as part of the hiring process.\n\r\n\n\r\n• Sales or customer-facing experience — You've worked in a role where you talked to customers, answered questions, and helped them make purchasing decisions. Inside sales, customer service in a technical environment, or B2B sales support all count.\n\r\n\n\r\n• CRM experience — You've used a CRM system to track leads and manage a pipeline. HubSpot experience is a strong plus but not required.\n\r\n\n\r\n• Reliable internet and a quiet workspace — This is a phone-heavy role. Background noise, dropped calls, or laggy connections are not workable.\n\r\n\n\r\n• Available to work US Eastern Time business hours — 9 AM to 6 PM or 10 AM to 7 PM ET, Monday through Friday.\n\r\n\n\r\nSTRONGLY PREFERRED:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Experience in building products, building materials, or home improvement industry\n\r\n• Experience selling or supporting sales of high-ticket items ($2,000–$5,000+)\n\r\n• Experience working with both retail customers (homeowners) and trade professionals (contractors, architects)\n\r\n• Familiarity with Shopify\n\r\n• Experience working remotely for a US-based company\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO WILL THRIVE IN THIS ROLE:\n\r\n\n\r\n• You are patient and genuinely enjoy helping people work through decisions — even when they ask the same question three different ways\n\r\n• You are organized and follow through — if you tell a customer you'll call them Thursday, you call them Thursday\n\r\n• You take initiative — if a lead goes quiet, you don't wait to be told to follow up\n\r\n• You are comfortable with complexity — our products have many specifications and our customers' construction situations vary widely\n\r\n• You want a long-term position with room to grow — we are building a team, not hiring for a project\n\r\n\n\r\n---------- WHAT WE OFFER ----------\n\r\n\n\r\n• $12–$14 USD/hour depending on your experience — this is a premium rate and reflects the level of skill we're looking for\n\r\n• Stable, long-term employment — this is not a contract gig. We are looking for someone who will be with us for years\n\r\n• Growth opportunity — As you develop product expertise, your role will expand from nurturing/qualifying to independently closing sales. There is a clear path from sales support to a full sales role with performance bonuses or commission\n\r\n• Direct access to the business owner — You will work closely with the founder, not through layers of management. Your ideas and feedback are valued.\n\r\n• Small team, big impact — You'll be the 4th full time tea\nmber. What you do matters. You're not a number.\n\r\n\n\r\n---------- HOW TO APPLY ----------\n\r\n\n\r\n*** IMPORTANT — This is a two-step application. You must complete BOTH steps. Applications missing either step will not be reviewed. ***\n\r\n\n\r\nSTEP 1: Submit your application here on OnlineJobs.ph\n\r\n\n\r\n• Use EXACTLY 4 Apply Points when submitting your application.\n\r\n• Use this EXACT subject line format: Sales Support – [Your First Name] – [Your Years of Construction Experience]\n\r\n  Example: Sales Support – Marco – 6 Years\n\r\n• In your message, confirm that you have completed the application form (Step 2 below). You do not need to repeat your full answers here — just confirm you submitted the form.\n\r\n\n\r\nSTEP 2: Complete our application form\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis form includes questions about your construction experience, sales background, and CRM usage. It also requires two uploads:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. A 2–3 minute VOICE RECORDING (unscripted — just talk naturally about your background and why you're a fit for this role). This is required. Applications without a voice recording will not be reviewed.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. A SCREENSHOT of your internet speed test from speedtest.net.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe form takes 15–20 minutes to complete. Please answer every question thoughtfully and in your own words.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will cross-reference your OJP application with your form submission. Both must be complete and consistent. Applications that follow all instructions will be reviewed within 3–5 business days.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n---------- HIRING PROCESS\n. Application review (AI-assisted matching + manual review of both OJP application and form submission)\n\r\n2. Video interview (unscripted conversation, not a formal Q&A)\n\r\n3. Paid trial task: Respond to 3 sample customer scenarios we provide\n\r\n4. Reference check\n\r\n5. 30-day paid trial period\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not looking for someone who is \"willing to learn construction.\" We need someone who already has a foundation in this area and can build on it quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you for your time. We look forward to hearing from you.                ",

    "description": "\n                    On the terminology question: \"Peptides\" is totally fine — it's a legitimate scientific/health term and OnlineJobs.ph won't flag it. \"Research chemicals\" I'd avoid. It carries connotations that could get flagged or scare off applicants. Use \"research-use compounds\" or \"research peptides\" instead — same meaning, zero risk.\n\r\nHere's the updated job description:\n\r\nWe are a US-based e-commerce company specializing in research-use peptides and the biohacking/performance optimization space. We are looking for a sharp, self-driven Influencer Outreach Specialist who can identify, contact, and build relationships with niche content creators and influencers in the peptide, bodybuilding, anti-aging, and longevity communities.\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT: We do not currently have a brand Instagram account. You will be responsible for creating and managing an outreach-focused Instagram presence that you will use to connect with influencers directly. This is a ground-floor opportunity to help build our influencer program from scratch.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe offer influencers very competitive rates and partnership opportunities, so you will NOT be cold-pitching with nothing to offer — you'll have real budget and attractive deals to bring to the table.\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR RESPONSIBILITIES:\n\r\n- Create and manage a professional Instagram account to use as a home base for influencer outreach\n\r\n- Research and build targeted lists of micro and mid-tier influencers (5K–100K followers) across Instagram, YouTube,\n/X, TikTok, and\n in the peptide, biohacking, bodybuilding, and longevity niches\n\r\n- Aggressively research competitor peptide brands, identify which influencers and creators they are working with, and recruit those influencers to work with us instead — offering better rates, better products, and better partnerships\n\r\n- Send personalized DM and\n outreach to prospective influencers on behalf of the brand\n\r\n- Negotiate and coordinate content deals (paid posts, affiliate arrangements, product-for-review, UGC)\n\r\n- Track all outreach, responses, negotiations, and campaign performance in a shared spreadsheet or CRM\n\r\n- Monitor competitor activity on an ongoing basis — know who they're sponsoring, what deals they're offering, and where the gaps are\n\r\n- Stay current on community trends, language, and culture within the peptide and biohacking space\n\r\n\n\r\nIDEAL CANDIDATE:\n\r\n- Has personal interest or knowledge in peptides, fitness, supplements, biohacking, or health optimization\n\r\n- Understands influencer marketing mechanics (engagement rates, audience quality, negotiation tactics)\n\r\n- Competitive mindset — you enjoy the challenge of winning over creators from rival brands\n\r\n- Excellent written English — outreach messages need to sound natural, persuasive, and personalized\n\r\n- Highly organized, self-motivated, and comfortable working independently with minimal supervision\n\r\n- Familiar with tools like Google Sheets, Instagram, YouTube analytics, and basic CRM platforms\n\r\n- Bonus: Experience with affiliate program management or influencer databases (Modash, Heepsy, or similar)\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a long-term role with room to grow for the right person. We want someone who operates like it's their own brand — resourceful, aggressive, and proud of the partnerships they build.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include in your application:\n\r\n1. Any experience in influencer outreach, social media management, or competitor research\n\r\n2. Your familiarity with the peptide, fitness, or biohacking space (even personal interest counts)\n\r\n3. Name 2 peptide or supplement brands you're aware of and one influencer you'd target for us (shows you can research)                ",

As we scale, we’re not just looking for people who can do the job; we’re looking for leaders who can build better ways to work.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are hiring our first dedicated HR Generalist to lay the foundation of our HR systems, processes, and structure. We don’t have a fully developed HR department yet, so this role is ideal for someone who’s not only experienced but also excited to create, implement, and improve everything from scratch.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities:\n\r\nAs our HR Generalist, you will take on a wide range of HR tasks that ensure our internal operations run smoothly and our people feel supported and empowered. You’ll report directly to company leadership and work closely with multiple departments to:\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Recruitment & Onboarding\n\r\n- Coordinate the full recruitment process, from posting job ads to screening, interviews, and hiring\n\r\n- Set up onboarding documents, welcome kits, and systems for new hires\n\r\n- Schedule training sessions and support new hire integration\n\r\n\n\r\n????

HR Projects & Culture Building\n\r\n- Design and roll out new HR initiatives, including SOPs, employee handbooks, and training\n\r\n- Support leadership in building an HR structure that scales as the company grows\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’re Looking For\n\r\nWe’re not looking for someone who just wants to follow instructions; we need someone who can think independently, lead with empathy, and build from a blank canvas. The ideal candidate is:\n\r\n- An experienced HR Generalist with 2+ years of relevant experience\n\r\n- Strong in the labor laws and HR compliance\n\r\n- Proactive in setting up systems, not just maintaining them\n\r\n- Tech-savvy and familiar with HRIS tools, Google Workspace, spreadsheets\n\r\n- Comfortable managing people issues with confidentiality, integrity, and care\n\r\n- A strong communicator—both written and verbal\n\r\n- Excited to help build something meaningful from the ground up\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Join Us?\n\r\n- You’ll build your own department and leave your mark on a growing company\n\r\n- Work remotely\n\r\n- Learn and grow alongside a team that values ownership and initiative\n\r\n- Be part of a purpose-driven team that’s empowering businesses and creating jobs globally\n\r\n- Career growth and leadership opportunities as the company expands\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nIf this sounds like the challenge you’ve been waiting for, we’d love to hear from you!\n\r\nPlease send your resume and a brief intro video or cover letter explaining:\n\r\n- Why are you the right person to build our HR systems?\n\r\n- What excites you about this role and working with us?
