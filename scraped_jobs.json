    "description": "\n                    Hi\n\r\n\n\r\nMy name is Howie! Thanks so much for reading this job posting. A little about me before jumping into the role: I'm a fun, friendly 30 year old software engineer living in California. I train Jiu Jitsu most days, travel a lot, do camping/road trips, am creative in both my work and personal life, and do amateur photo/videography that I'm going to start making content with. I live an active life and it's about to get more busy as I've just launched my consulting business and it's already moving fast. The rest of this job posting is dense and overwhelming so wanted to show that I was a real person first, not some business executive.\n\r\n\n\r\nMy \n\r\nMy LinkedIn: \n\r\nBusiness page: \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\r\n---------------\n\r\n\n\r\nI run a consulting business based in San Francisco and Miami where I provide guidance on companies' operations, build any software they may need, and connect them to any new AI tools that would make them more efficient. Clients include tech startups, accounting firms, a law firm and individuals so far, so you'll get exposure to those industries. It's been one month but already I need help as I'm being quickly referred by my existing clients. My 3 month goal is to grow this from just me to an agency with other engineers, a designer, video editor, content/marketing. I need a sharp, resourceful assistant like you to be an extension of me in my personal life and for the business.\n\r\n\n\r\n- The 20hrs/week for me will be a mix of my personal tasks and tasks for the business. If we end up needing more hours that's no problem for me, just estimating 20hrs for now.\n\r\n- You'll also have the option to work 10hrs/week for my sister and her fiance's accounting firm that they run (or if you know anyone feel free to refer them)\n\r\n- Then there will be frequent opportunities for you to do work directly for our clients as needed. For instance, if the law firm has a project they need help with. This can pay $7/hr.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY WORK WITH ME\n\r\n-----------------\n\r\n\n\r\nYou won't be doing repetitive work. This is a dynamic, high-trust position. Here's what makes this worth your time:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll work with the latest AI tools - I use and build AI tools for a living. I live in Silicon Valley so I'm the first to hear about any new tools, and I get to meet a lot of the people building them. You'll be using those same tools daily. I hope we can work together forever but if not you'll come out of this role with hands-on experience that you can put on your resume or use to start your own business!\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll learn my productivity systems - I work fast and efficiently. Together we'll create systems to get things done faster than 99% of the world. I invest in making us better - if you need something to do work more efficiently it's yours. If you want to develop a skill that will help the business go for it. The skills we build together will be beneficial for any future position.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll gain experience across multiple industries.\n\r\n\n\r\nThere's a real growth path - The right person's responsibility and pay will grow with the company.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSCHEDULE & COMPENSATION\n\r\n------------------------\n\r\n\n\r\nHours: 20-40 hrs/week as stated above\n\r\nAvailability: Mostly on your own time but some work (like calling businesses) will need to be done during Pacific Time business hours: 9AM - 5PM PST. And I'm sometimes busy with clients during those hours so if you and I need to meet then it might be done outside of those hours e.g. 8AM or 6pm PST. So flexibility is a plus.\n\r\nRate: $5-7/hr USD (based on experience). Any ad hoc work for other clients billed at $7/hr.\n\r\nGrowth: Compensation reviews at 3 months and 6 months\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL BE DOING\n\r\n---------------------\n\r\n\n\r\nBusiness Tasks\n\r\n\n\r\n- Researching and trialing new tools and services and reporting back on whether they're worth it\n\r\n- Finding and vetting video editors for both business and personal content. Sourcing a designer for brand and visual identity work. Finding a front-end software engineer for project-based work. Identifying someone to help with brand strategy and content creation. A part-time junior software engineer\n\r\n- Drafting and editing client\ns and cold outreach in a real person's voice\n\r\n- Industry research: What AI tools are being adopted in accounting? What does a mid-size law firm's tech stack look like?\n\r\n- Setting up and optimizing the business profiles across platforms: Creating and optimizing profiles on Google Business Profile, LinkedIn Services, Clutch, G2, Yelp Business, and other relevant directories for consultants\n\r\n- Conducting a digital presence audit - searching for the business across Google, LinkedIn, and other platforms, documenting where we rank, who appears above us, and identifying specific opportunities to improve visibility\n\r\n- Seeing what other agencies do, copying them, maybe reaching out to work together or become friends\n\r\n- Project manager - coordinating with me, clients and contractors\n\r\n- Administration e.g. managing expenses in Quickbooks\n\r\n\n\r\nPersonal Tasks\n\r\n\n\r\n- Managing schedules\n\r\n- Making calls to US businesses on my behalf - banks, government agencies, insurance companies, service providers\n\r\n-\ning companies for customer support\n\r\n-\n management: cleaning up inboxes, following up on deliveries\n\r\n- Sourcing things I need to buy from\n Marketplace, Amazon, eBay\n\r\n- Researching and booking travel arrangements: hotels, campgrounds, events, interesting stops, scenic routes, activities, events, restaurants\n\r\n- Reaching out to professional services for things like moving, printing services, etc\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTOOLS\n\r\n------\n\r\n\n\r\nYou do NOT need experience with most of these. Having experience is a plus. What matters most is that you can pick up new tools quickly e.g. via YouTube tutorial. That's the skill I care about. Though some of these are very useful for any work you may do so even if you don't apply I highly recommend looking into them!\n\r\n\n\r\n- Slack - communication, task assignment\n\r\n- Loom - video recording. Besides Slack we'll be communicating through video more than anything\n\r\n- Claude / ChatGPT (will ask to see your chat history because there are smart ways to communicate with these. This is the best way I can see how you think)\n\r\n- Zapier / Make / n8n - workflow automation (HUGE plus if you have experience here!)\n\r\n- Bitwarden - password and credential management (like LastPass or 1Password)\n\r\n- OpenPhone or Google Voice - US business phone number\n\r\n- Linear - task management (like Jira)\n\r\n- Todoist - personal task management\n\r\n- Wispr Flow - voice-to-text dictation\n\r\n- Granola - AI meeting notes\n\r\n- Google Workspace\n\r\n- Canva - light design work\n\r\n- Superhuman - high-speed\n management\n\r\n- Notion - documentation and SOPs\n\r\n- Perplexity - AI-powered research\n\r\n- Claude Cowork - desktop automation agent (big plus if you have experience here)\n\r\n- Tango - step-by-step guides and SOP creation\n\r\n- Toggl Track - time tracking and reporting\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nQUALIFICATIONS\n\r\n---------------\n\r\n\n\r\nFirst thing's first - if your application sounds like it was generated by AI, I'll ignore it. That doesn't mean don't use AI to help write it - I'm using it to help me write this posting. But I'm editing it heavily so that it has my voice. A real voice. Your work will involve the same - clients don't want to get\ns that sound like AI. So your application is the first test of this.\n\r\n\n\r\nMust-haves:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong written and spoken English. Reliable internet. Quiet environment to make calls.\n\r\n- Available for a 2-3 hour window during US Pacific business hours (PST)\n\r\n- Day to day flexibility would be really great. You can mostly do tasks whenever best for you but I might ask for things at any point during my day - like making a cool graphic for a last minute client presentation - and it would be nice if you were available.\n\r\n- Available (some) Saturdays. Since I'm busy with clients during the week, my personal tasks end up on the weekends.

    "description": "\n                    Innovative global coffee brand inventing one-of-a-kind tools redefining how coffee is experienced. Seeking a Marketing Operator to own campaigns, launches, and cross-channel execution alongside founders.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT ICOSA BREWHOUSE:\n\r\nICOSA Brewhouse is a globally recognized specialty coffee brand redefining how coffee is experienced. We are shaping coffee culture around the world. (\n  / \n )\n\r\n\n\r\nWe design and invent one-of-a-kind tools that didn’t exist before — tools that elevate everyday rituals and introduce new ways of enjoying coffee.\n\r\n\n\r\nFrom record-breaking Kickstarter launches to collaborations with world-class coffee professionals, our products are used by champions, in top cafés, and in homes in 100+ countries around the world. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a design-led, innovation-driven brand operating in a niche we are actively shaping. We build thoughtfully, test deliberately, and care deeply about quality — in both product and execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs we continue to innovate, launch new products, and grow, we are looking for a Senior Social Media & Marketing Manager to take ownership of how our work is brought to life across channels.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou won’t just publish content.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll help shape how new products are introduced, how campaigns are structured, and how our global community experiences our brand — while ensuring execution remains disciplined, consistent, and scalable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR ROLE AND OPPORTUNITY ON THE TEAM:\n\r\nThis is a senior marketing operator role. Execution is central — but it is not a junior content posting role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work directly with our Marketing Lead to:\n\r\n• Own day-to-day marketing delivery across core channels\n\r\n• Structure and execute campaigns from planning through rollout\n\r\n• Translate ideas into clear, executable briefs\n\r\n• Coordinate creative production across internal, outsourced, and AI-assisted workflows\n\r\n• Strengthen how our marketing engine operates over time\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will see early product prototypes.\n\r\nYou will contribute to campaign discussions before launch.\n\r\nYou will help shape how innovation is presented to a global audience.\n\r\n\n\r\nExecution is central to this role — but so is judgment, ownership, and the ability to think in campaigns rather than isolated posts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll own:\n\r\n\n\r\n(1) Marketing Execution Across Channels\n\r\n• Own social media execution (Instagram and\n).\n\r\n• Plan and manage content calendars aligned with brand positioning.\n\r\n• Ensure consistent publishing and follow-through across platforms.\n\r\n• Manage inbox and community engagement, including partnership or influencer communication if required.\n\r\n• Execute\n campaigns aligned with launches, promotions, and collaborations.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou ensure marketing execution remains structured, timely, and dependable.\n\r\n\n\r\n(2) Campaign Rollout & Launch Execution\n\r\n• Support and execute seasonal campaigns, product launches, collaborations, and promotional initiatives.\n\r\n• Translate marketing objectives into structured creative briefs.\n\r\n• Coordinate creative asset development across designers, freelancers, and AI-supported workflows.\n\r\n• Oversee cohesive cross-channel rollout so messaging, visuals, and timing align across social,\n, and paid efforts.\n\r\n• Strengthen campaign structure and rollout processes over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou think in campaigns — not just content pieces.\n\r\n\n\r\n(3) Creative Briefing & Quality Control\n\r\n• Create clear, structured briefs for design and content production.\n\r\n• Maintain high standards of aesthetic consistency, messaging clarity, and brand voice integrity across both human and AI-assisted workflows.\n\r\n• Draft copy or guide AI-assisted content creation when needed, ensuring outputs remain on-brand and high quality.\n\r\n• Review creative outputs for brand alignment before escalation to the Marketing Lead.\n\r\n• Collaborate comfortably in tools such as Figma or similar platforms to support execution and alignment.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou don’t need to be a designer — but you should have strong creative judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\n(4) Growth & Operational Development\n\r\n• Identify opportunities to refine workflows and strengthen how our marketing engine operates.\n\r\n• Lead or contribute to structured testing and rollout of new channels or initiatives as capacity allows.\n\r\n• Over time, take increasing ownership of campaign structuring, cross-channel coordination, partnership campaign oversight, and creative alignment across performance-driven efforts.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs you demonstrate reliability and judgment, your scope expands meaningfully.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat success looks like:\n\r\n• Social and\n channels operate smoothly with consistent execution and strong brand alignment.\n\r\n• Campaigns are rolled out in a coordinated, cross-channel manner without last-minute chaos.\n\r\n• Creative briefs are structured, clear, and reduce friction across collaborators.\n\r\n• Marketing execution no longer bottlenecks leadership attention.\n\r\n• Early experiments in new channels or initiatives are tested in a structured way.\n\r\n\n\r\nOver time, you become a trusted execution leader within the marketing team.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Is Not:\n\r\n• Not a pure content creator role.\n\r\n• Not a brand strategist role.\n\r\n• Not a paid media buyer role.\n\r\n• Not an administrative coordinator role.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a senior marketing operator position inside a growing global brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT YOU / WHO WE’RE LOOKING FOR:\n\r\nYou are someone who:\n\r\n• Understands how structured marketing campaigns come together.\n\r\n• Can translate ideas into clear execution plans.\n\r\n• Is comfortable owning delivery without hand-holding.\n\r\n• Is comfortable reviewing performance data and using insights to inform execution decisions.\n\r\n• Is strategic enough to think ahead — but practical enough to execute consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are strategic enough to think ahead — but practical enough to execute consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have skills or experience:\n\r\n• 4–6+ years of experience managing marketing and/or social for a brand.\n\r\n• Experience executing structured marketing campaigns.\n\r\n• Experience within D2C or product-based brands strongly preferred.\n\r\n• Comfortable operating inside e-commerce environments.\n\r\n• Highly detail-oriented and disciplined in follow-through.\n\r\n• Strong creative judgment and ability to assess content quality and brand alignment.\n\r\n• Comfort collaborating in design tools such as Figma.\n\r\n• Comfortable working directly with founders in a small, fast-moving team.\n\r\n\n\r\nBig pluses:\n\r\n• Experience supporting product launches or crowdfunding campaigns.\n\r\n• Experience creating, implementing, and refining marketing processes or building SOPs.\n\r\n• Experience coordinating freelancers or creative collaborators.\n\r\n• Familiarity with Klaviyo or similar\n platforms.\n\r\n• Exposure to AI-assisted marketing workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY JOIN US:\n\r\nAt ICOSA Brewhouse, you will:\n\r\n• Work directly with founders who are deeply involved in product design, positioning, and global campaigns.\n\r\n• Operate close to innovation — seeing products and launches before they are introduced to the world.\n\r\n• Contribute to campaigns that reach a global coffee audience.\n\r\n• Have real ownership inside a small, high-performing team where your work is visible and impactful.\n\r\n• Help shape coffee culture around the world.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a fully remote team — but we operate with structure and discipline.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be joining a close-knit group focused on building something meaningful with collaboration and accountability. There is no office politics. No unnecessary hierarchy. Just people committed to high standards.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe care deeply about growth — not just as a company, but as individuals. As we expand, there are real opportunities to take on broader ownership, lead initiatives, and shape how our marketing evolves.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want a role where:\n\r\n• Your ideas are heard.\n\r\n• Your execution matters.\n\r\n• Your scope can grow with your capability.\n\r\nYou will feel at home here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION AND WORKING STRUCTURE\n\r\nFull time: 40 hours/week \n\r\nCompensation range: $1,100-$1,800 (based on relevant experience and demonstrated capability)\n\r\nUp to 16 days of paid time off annually\n\r\nAsia time zone working hours required\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nAre you ready? \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’d like to join us on our journey and grow together with us, we’re looking forward to meeting you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe understand you may have a busy schedule, so we’ve made our application process extremely efficient. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please follow the steps below:\n\r\n1.

    "description": "\n                    We're looking for a full-time Social Media & Content Manager who will own the end-to-end content pipeline across multiple brands and platforms. This is NOT a \"schedule a few posts and call it a day\" role. You will be the operational backbone of our content machine - managing AI-powered content creation workflows, repurposing existing content at scale, and ensuring a consistent stream of high-quality, targeted content goes out across every account, every day.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe majority of your work will center on project managing AI automations and content creation tools - not doing everything manually, but orchestrating the systems that produce, adapt, and distribute content efficiently.  You’ll be working alongside n8n workflows that will research, write and post content. We’re not expecting you to manage the workflows... your job will be to make sure the content is actually getting posted, responding to comments, managing DMs, etc. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe Mission\n\r\nEverything you do in this role serves exactly two objectives:\n\r\n1. Grow the channels. Increase followers, reach, impressions, and audience size on every platform, every month. Period.\n\r\n2. Drive conversions. Turn that audience into leads, booked calls, opt-ins, and revenue. Likes don't pay the bills.\n\r\n\n\r\nEvery post you schedule, every video you repurpose, every caption you write, every automation you manage - all of it must ladder up to one or both of these outcomes. We are not publishing content for the sake of publishing content. We are not chasing vanity metrics. We are not posting just to \"stay active.\" If a piece of content doesn't serve growth or conversion, it doesn't go out.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be expected to think strategically about how each piece of content moves the needle. That means understanding the funnel, knowing what CTAs to use and when, and being able to connect content performance directly to business results. If your approach to social media is \"post and pray,\" this is not the role for you. Start your proposal with the word \"content ninja\" so we know you read the full description.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\n-Platform Management: You will manage multiple accounts across the following platforms - each with its own ICP (Ideal Customer Profile), messaging, and content strategy:\n\r\n-LinkedIn (personal brand + company pages)\n\r\n-TikTok\n\r\n-Instagram\n\r\n\n Personal Page\n\r\n\n Business Page(s)\n\r\n-Content Repurposing & Creation: You'll take existing long-form content (videos, podcasts, articles, webinars, live streams) and repurpose it into platform-specific formats using AI tools including but not limited to:\n\r\nChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, \n\r\nPictory (video content repurposing)\n\r\nCapCut (short-form video editing)\n\r\nChatGPT / Claude (copy generation, scripting, ideation)\n\r\nCanva (graphics, carousels, stories)\n\r\nOther AI content tools as we adopt them (and we adopt new tools regularly)\n\r\n-AI Workflow & Automation Management: You'll manage and monitor automated content pipelines, ensuring outputs meet quality standards before publishing. This includes working with tools like n8n, GoHighLevel, and other automation platforms to keep content flowing.\n\r\n-Content Calendar & Scheduling: Maintain and execute a content calendar across all platforms and accounts. Every account should have consistent, scheduled content with no gaps.\n\r\n-ICP-Targeted Content: Each account targets a specific audience. You are responsible for ensuring that every piece of content is relevant, on-brand, and tailored to the ICP for that specific account. No generic, one-size-fits-all posting.\n\r\n-Performance Tracking & Reporting: Monitor growth and conversion metrics across every account. Identify what's driving actual results - not just engagement, but follower growth, link clicks, opt-ins, and booked calls. You are expected to bring data-informed recommendations and pivot strategy when something isn't moving the needle.\n\r\n-Community Engagement: Monitor comments, DMs, and mentions. Engage with the audience authentically and escalate conversations that require a personal touch.\n\r\n-Trend Awareness: Stay current with platform algorithm changes, trending formats, viral content styles, and emerging AI tools that could improve our workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n-Experience: Minimum 2 years of verifiable social media management experience. You must be able to provide examples of accounts you've managed, growth metrics you've achieved, and references from previous clients or employers. If you cannot verify your experience, do not apply.\n\r\n-AI Tool Proficiency: You must be comfortable using AI-powered content creation and editing tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Pictory, CapCut, Canva, AI writing assistants, etc.\n\r\n-Multi-Platform Expertise: Demonstrated experience managing content across LinkedIn, TikTok, Instagram, and\n simultaneously. You understand the nuances of each platform - what works on TikTok does NOT work on LinkedIn, and you know why.\n\r\n-Project Management Skills: You'll be managing multiple content pipelines, automation workflows, and publishing schedules. Strong organizational skills and attention to detail are essential.\n\r\n-Written Communication: Excellent English writing skills. You'll be crafting or refining copy daily using AI, but you’ll need to know what’s “good” and what isn’t.\n\r\n-Availability: This is a full-time position - 8 hours per day, 5 days per week. You must be available during EASTERN US working hours and responsive on communication channels throughout the day.\n\r\n\n\r\nDo NOT Apply If:\n\r\n-You cannot dedicate 40 hours per week to this role. \n\r\n-You cannot provide verifiable proof of at least 2 years of social media management experience.\n\r\n-You are looking for a part-time or casual gig.\n\r\n-You are not comfortable learning and using new AI tools on a regular basis.\n\r\n-You do not have reliable internet and a professional work setup.\n\r\n\n\r\nPreferred (Bonus) Qualifications\n\r\n-Experience with GoHighLevel, n8n, Zapier, or similar automation platforms\n\r\n-Video editing skills beyond basic cuts (motion graphics, captions, transitions)\n\r\n-Understanding of B2B content strategy, particularly for LinkedIn\n\r\n-Experience working with personal brands or thought leadership content\n\r\n-Familiarity with content strategy for service-based businesses or consultancies\n\r\n-Analytics experience (Meta Business Suite, LinkedIn Analytics, TikTok Analytics)\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nIn your proposal, include:\n\r\n-One page resume or CV that outlines your social media management experience (accounts managed, platforms, duration)\n\r\n-Links to at least 2 social media accounts you have managed (with permission to share)\n\r\n-List any stats that you may have (“I grew this channel by 10,000 followers in 6 months”, etc)\n\r\n-Which AI content creation tools you currently use and how you use them\n\r\n-Your current client load and confirmation that you can commit to 40 hours/week\n\r\n-Your timezone and typical working hours\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: Generic proposals, AI create proposals and auto-bids will be immediately discarded and reported.

Your job is to understand the psychology, messaging, and strategy behind each ad concept — and bring it to life through strong visual hierarchy, compelling layouts, persuasive copy placement, and attention to detail.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs a Performance Graphic Designer, you are responsible for the execution and final polish of our static ad creatives across platforms like\n, Instagram, and TikTok.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe success of our marketing team depends on your ability to:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Understand each creative brief from a performance/direct-response marketing lens\n\r\n- Design static ad creatives that grab attention and drive clicks\n\r\n- Structure layouts, headlines, offers, and call-to-actions for maximum conversion impact\n\r\n- Enhance the core marketing message through smart visual decisions\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand that small details — spacing, typography, contrast, hook placement — can be the difference between an ad that scales to millions in spend and one that fails during testing.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour role is to work closely with our Creative Strategists, actively learn what makes ads win or lose, and help us consistently produce winning creatives month over month across our brand portfolio.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPrimary Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\n- Design and deliver ~5 static ad briefs per week\n\r\n- Collaborate closely with Creative Strategists to ensure each concept is executed accurately\n\r\n- Implement feedback from the creative team and performance data to improve iterations\n\r\n- Learn and internalize our ad strategy frameworks to understand what makes creatives “win” or “lose”\n\r\n- Analyze your own designs to identify what’s working and what isn’t\n\r\n- Prepare and export final assets in correct sizes and formats for each advertising platform\n\r\n- Organize design files and assets properly for team workflow\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nQualifications\n\r\nDirect Experience\n\r\n- 1+ year experience designing eCommerce / performance marketing static ads\n\r\n- Strong portfolio showcasing direct-response or conversion-focused creatives\n\r\n- Experience working within a team and understanding creative workflows\n\r\n- Proficiency in tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, or Canva (advanced level)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCharacter Traits We Look For\n\r\n\n\r\n- Extremely high attention to detail — you care about alignment, spacing, readability, and polish\n\r\n- Creative + marketing-minded — you’re not just a designer, you care about performance\n\r\n- Strong understanding of visual hierarchy and direct-response principles\n\r\n- Curious about why certain ads perform better than others\n\r\n- Coachable and open to feedback\n\r\n- Clear communicator who collaborates well with a team\n\r\n- Time-efficient but willing to put in extra effort when quality demands it\n\r\n- Growth-oriented — you want to improve your marketing and creative skills\n\r\n- To make sure you are still reading, type “BLUE” in your response title.\n\r\n- Not a clock-in, clock-out mindset — you care about results and impact\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis Role Is NOT for You If:\n\r\n\n\r\n- You only want to make “pretty” designs without caring about conversions\n\r\n- You’re not interested in learning performance marketing or ad psychology\n\r\n- You dislike feedback or fast-paced environments\n\r\n- You’re disorganized or unreliable\n\r\n- You prefer working solo and don’t enjoy collaboration\n\r\n- You’re not motivated to grow your skills long-term\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nGrowth & Upside\n\r\n\n\r\nAt Ivy Ecommerce, we invest in people who perform and show initiative. This role has real upside for those who take ownership:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Opportunity to grow into a Senior Designer / Creative Strategist role\n\r\n- Increased responsibility across multiple brands in our portfolio\n\r\n- Performance-based bonuses tied to ad performance (no cap)\n\r\n- Long-term growth path into higher-level marketing and creative leadership roles\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a long-term opportunity for someone who wants to build a career in performance marketing and creative strategy — not just design static graphics.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n???? How to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nTo be considered, please reply with:\n\r\n\n\r\n- A short overview of yourself\n\r\n- Your CV / Resume with past work experience\n\r\n- Your eCommerce static ad portfolio (conversion-focused work preferred)\n\r\n- Your\n address + WhatsApp number\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThen answer the questions below in detail:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. What about this role excites you most?\n\r\n2. Why do you believe you’re a strong fit for this role?\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that do not follow these instructions or provide detailed answers will not be reviewed.                ",

You adapt or suggest changes to others, so those patterns become opportunities for growth.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou care about doing things intentionally. You think things through, break them down clearly, notice details others miss, and bring a sense of order to what you take on.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re naturally curious... the kind of person who wants to understand how things work and why something is the way it is.

WE ARE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WITH REAL OUTBOUND SALES AND COLD CALLING EXPERIENCE ONLY. IF YOU HAVE NEVER DIALED COLD LEADS FOR MARKETING AGENCIES AND PITCHED A STRANGER WITH NO PRIOR INTEREST, THIS JOB IS NOT FOR YOU. PLEASE MOVE ON. WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO FEEL THEY CAN DO IT, WE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE IT AND WILLING TO DO IT AGAIN.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW PAYMENT WORKS — READ CAREFULLY BEFORE APPLYING\n\r\nPayment is released only when all 5,000 contacts have been called and all outcomes are fully logged. Partial completion does not qualify for payment under any circumstance.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour earnings are determined by the number of confirmed bookings you produce:\n\r\n\n\r\nBelow 200 bookings — Project is considered incomplete. You receive a one-time flat payment of $300 USD only.\n\r\n200–224 bookings (Quota 1 met) — You receive the base $300 USD plus a $175 USD bonus = $475 USD total.\n\r\n225–249 bookings (Quota 2 met) — You receive the base $300 USD plus a $350 USD bonus = $650 USD total.\n\r\n250+ bookings (Quota 3 met) — You receive the base $300 USD plus a $660 USD bonus = $950 USD total.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe minimum quota of 200 confirmed bookings must be met for full payment to be released without review. Hitting 250+ also opens the door to a monthly ongoing role — details below.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE JOB\n\r\nYou will be given a list of 5,000 cold leads. Your job is to call every single one of them and book as many appointments as possible. Each lead must be attempted up to 3 times before being marked as unreachable. Calls must be made at varied times of day — do not call the same person back-to-back or at the same time each attempt. Use morning, midday, and afternoon/evening windows to maximize answer rates.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU NEED TO DO\n\r\n\n\r\nWork through the full list of 5,000 leads systematically\n\r\n- Attempt each lead up to 3 times at different times before marking as no-answer\n\r\n- Pitch naturally, qualify quickly, and book the appointment\n\r\n- Book only qualified prospects — do not say whatever it takes just to get someone on the calendar. A booking only counts if the lead genuinely fits our criteria, understands what the meeting is about, and has agreed to show up with real interest. - - Unqualified or misleading bookings will not count toward your quota and will reflect poorly on your performance review\n\r\n- Enter all call outcomes and notes into our CRM or tracking sheet\n\r\n- Send confirmation details to every booked prospect\n\r\n- Call every booked prospect approximately 2 hours before their scheduled meeting to confirm they are still attending. If they need to reschedule, handle it on the spot, update the calendar, and log the change. No-shows that were not confirmed beforehand will not count as completed bookings\n\r\n- Submit a final report of all outcomes when the list is complete\n\r\n\n\r\nPERFORMANCE QUOTA\n\r\nWe expect real results from a real caller. Here is what the benchmark looks like:\n\r\n\n\r\n200 bookings (4%) — Minimum to qualify for full payment\n\r\n225 bookings (4.5%) — Strong performance\n\r\n250+ bookings (5%+) — Outstanding performance, monthly role will be offered\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant: Bookings are only counted when they are qualified, confirmed, and the pre-meeting check-in call has been completed. Do not try to inflate your numbers with weak or misleading bookings — quality is reviewed alongside quantity.\n\r\nThe minimum to be considered complete and get paid in full is 200 confirmed appointments. Anything below that will be reviewed before payment is released. Hit 250 or above and we will be talking about bringing you on monthly.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\n\r\n- Proven outbound cold calling experience — this is mandatory\n\r\n- Fluent, confident English with no heavy accent, mumbling, or filler words\n\r\n- Sounds human and natural on the phone, not robotic\n\r\n- Can handle rejection and keep dialing without losing energy\n\r\n- Able to qualify leads accurately during the call — you must be able to identify genuine interest and fit, not just push anyone into a booking to hit numbers\n\r\n- Disciplined with follow-through — you are responsible for calling every booked lead 2 hours before their meeting to confirm attendance or reschedule as needed. This is part of the job, not optional\n\r\n- Reliable internet and a quality headset — audio must be clear\n\r\n- Able to work independently with no supervision\n\r\n- Must be able to complete the full project in a reasonable timeframe\n\r\n- Familiar with CRM tools (GHL) or Google Sheets for tracking\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION\n\r\n\n\r\n$300 USD base — one-time flat payment (paid upon full list completion)\n\r\n+$175 USD bonus if you hit Quota 1 (200–224 bookings)\n\r\n+$250 USD bonus if you hit Quota 2 (225–249 bookings)\n\r\n+$500 USD bonus if you hit Quota 3 (250+ bookings)\n\r\n\n\r\nPayment is released only after all 5,000 contacts are called, all outcomes are logged, and results are verified.\n\r\n\n\r\nWANT TO TURN THIS INTO SOMETHING BIGGER?\n\r\n\n\r\nThis gig is your audition. If you hit 250+ bookings and your quality is strong, we will offer you a monthly ongoing role with a consistent salary. Show us what you're made of and there is a real opportunity to build something long-term with us.                ",

This is great if you like working by yourself in the quiet, but it can be terribly painful if you need the energy of coworkers nearby.\n\r\nOur Cultural Values - We're an American company with an incredibly unusual culture. Even by American standards, our 7 cultural values are highly unusual. Our culture is challenging for people accustomed to corporate culture and especially difficult for people who grew up in Confucian cultures. It's a great culture for people who speak directly and have a great deal of self-confidence and ownership. If you identify as a misfit, you'll do well.\n\r\nMultiple Software Systems - You're going to need to learn how to use 12 different software systems. This is great if you want to get exposed to and experience lots of technology, but it can be tough if you have a hard time learning technology. Secret Message - When you apply, you'll see a box that asks if you want to add anything else. Type in PINK ELEPHANT in all capital letters exactly as we've shown it here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCheat Code for getting a job with us:\n\r\n1) Our application comprises the majority of our recruiting process. Because of that, we suggest that you give us thoughtful responses and rich stories. We typically only interview applicants who give rich and detailed answers to our questions. If you write short responses so that you can hurry up and finish the application, you will not get interviewed.\n\r\n2) Tell us stories about how your actions match your beliefs and values. For example, if I say I value health and fitness, you don't know if I'm telling you the truth or if I'm just telling you what sounds good. But, if I tell you things I've done, I can illustrate my values of health and fitness with proof. For example, I go to the gym 4 days per week, I've done 6 triathlons, including an Ironman, and I can swim 3000 meters in one hour. My examples of things I've done prove that my actions match my values system.\n\r\n3) Be vulnerable and honest. We take very detailed notes during the interview process, and we conduct extensive background checks. If the stories you tell about yourself don't match what your references say, we will not hire you. We'd rather hire a C student who is honest about being a C student than someone who is a C student but tries to pass themselves off as an A student. Remember, this is an entry-level job. We're not looking for perfect. We're looking for an excellent cultural fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply: Please click on the link: \n/work-opportunities/administration-agent                ",

    "description": "\n                    Hi there!\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are an online herbal education business on a mission to help people learn how to use herbal remedies, and natural healthcare in a safe and sustainable way.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re a small caring team that loves to engage with each other, while getting the work done, and we’re looking for our next perfect fit!\n\r\nWe create content, courses, and community to make that happen. We’re a fun, fresh, friendly, and informative brand, and leaders in the herbal education industry. We pride ourselves in being a trusted space to get solid herbal information backed by science, and blended with traditional wisdom that science hasn’t paid for, and actually living this life. \n\r\n\n\r\nOn a bigger picture, we make the complexities of herbalism simple and easy to understand. \n\r\nWe are growing, and we are looking for a virtual assistant (or maybe two!) who wants to be part of something that’s making a positive impact in the world, not just a task master, though the tasks are important. We want someone who actually gets excited about herbal medicine, loves beautiful content, and takes pride in doing things well. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe do NOT want loads of AI generated content!  While we do use AI as a tool, we really love and value the human touch. We’re seeking someone who can feel the brand, the natural vibes of it, and help connect to our ideal customers. \n\r\n\n\r\nHours are flexible and light to start (around 5 to 20 per week), with busier seasons when we run summits and launches. While the hours may be variable, we are seeking a long-term partner to build a lasting valuable relationship for all.  This is not a short one and done gig.\n\r\nOur last VA we worked with for 4 years but her life changed, and she’s moving on. Our other VA has also been with us for 4 years, and we’re still working and growing together.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Would Be Helping With - \n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for support across some or all of these areas, depending on your strengths:\n\r\n\n\r\nContent & Design\n\r\nCanva graphics for social media posts, story templates, and class slides\n\r\nKeeping our visual brand consistent and polished across everything\n\r\nSocial Media\n\r\nPlanning and scheduling content across YouTube, Pinterest, Instagram,\n, and TikTok\n\r\nRepurposing podcast content into short-form reels and social clips\n\r\nSuggesting social media strategy, and working with the founder (also the face of the brand) to outline the content\n\r\nPodcast & Video\n\r\nPodcast editing and publishing\n\r\nCutting podcast recordings into reels and YouTube-ready videos\n\r\nKajabi\n\r\nBuilding and updating pages (sales pages, landing pages, blog posts)\n\r\nCourse building and content uploads\n\r\nGeneral platform management and keeping things tidy\n\r\n\n\r\nYou do not need to do all of these. If you are a specialist in one or two areas, we would love to hear from you. If you are more of a generalist who can move across platforms, that is wonderful too.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTech We Use -\n\r\n\n\r\nCanva\n\r\nKajabi\n\r\nAsana\n\r\nGoogle Suite\n\r\n\r\nZoom\n\r\n\n\r\nHello Audio\n\r\nAudacity\n\r\nDescript\n\r\nCapcut\n\r\nLoom\n\r\nInstagram\n\r\n\r\nTikTok\n\r\nYouTube\n\r\nPinterest \n\r\nWhile this is a list of what we use in our business, you do not have to know them all, though bonus points if you do.  We’re happy to train the right person/people in the right platforms as needed.  If you have experience with them all, even better. But, don’t let the idea of not knowing them all keep you from responding.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We Are Looking For-\n\r\n\n\r\nWhile your skills are super important, we’re even more eager to find the right fit for this/these role/s. Here is what we genuinely care about:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou have a real interest in natural health, herbal remedies, nature, or holistic living. You do not have to be an expert, just curious and aligned with this way of life.\n\r\nYou are a self-starter who notices things and takes initiative without needing to be reminded.\n\r\nYou’re creative, and have ideas you’re not afraid to share.\n\r\nYou understand the online business landscape, and how to build new relationships and connections with customers.\n\r\nYou care about the details. A misaligned logo or a typo in a caption is something that bugs you too.\n\r\nYou communicate clearly and kindly, and you ask questions when something is not clear.\n\r\nYou want to get to know, and grow with a brand, not just complete tasks for it.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Fun Part: To Apply, We Need A Few Things From You\n\r\nThis is where you get to show us a little of who you are. We read every reply, and we notice when people actually pay attention.\n\r\n\n\r\n1- In your subject, or top of your reply to this, please TELL US YOUR FAVORITE FLOWER.  I will not read replies that do not have this in the subject line. This is how I know you’re paying attention.\n\r\n\n\r\n2- Somewhere in your reply, let us know what draws you to the world of herbs and natural health, even just a little.\n\r\n\n\r\nThat is it. Just introduce yourself, tell us what you do, share those two things, and include any relevant links or portfolio samples if you have them.\n\r\n\n\r\nThanks for taking the time.\n\r\nSo excited to meet you!\n\r\n\n\r\nMel - The Herbalist's Path                ",

    "description": "\n                    Hi there!\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're seeking a special Podcast/Youtube Video Editor for our herbal brands.\n\r\nYou would be working across two herbal brands that share a deep love for plant medicine, natural health, and making herbalism accessible to everyday people. Both are all about herbal remedies, only one is e-commerce herbal products, while the other is online herbal education.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe first is an online herbal education brand focused on the herbalist's path, helping people learn how to use herbal remedies and natural healthcare safely and sustainably. We're fun, fresh, friendly, and informative, and we take pride in blending solid science with traditional wisdom and real lived experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe second is Eclectic Herb, a trusted herbal product line with a long, respected legacy in the herbalism space. Same natural vibes, different expression of it all.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou would primarily work with one point of contact (that's me!) for direction and feedback across both brands, with occasional input from the owner of Eclectic Herb. You'll be serving two aligned missions with one clear relationship at the center.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're a small, caring team that loves to actually engage with each other while getting great work done. This is not a faceless gig. We genuinely value the people we work with, and our track record shows it. Our current VA has been with us for four years and counting. Our last one was with us for four years too before life took her in a new direction.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Is Really About - \n\r\n\n\r\nBoth brands record podcast content via Zoom, and that raw recording becomes the foundation for everything. Your job is to take that one recording and turn it into multiple pieces of polished, engaging content across formats. This takes both technical skill and genuine creative instincts.\n\r\n\n\r\nHours are flexible and will typically run between 5 and 20 per week, with busier seasons around summits and launches. We value quality over quantity, and we'll grow the hours together as the relationship builds.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere is what that looks like:\n\r\n\n\r\nPodcast Editing -\n\r\nClean, professional editing of full podcast episodes\n\r\nPublishing to podcast platforms via BuzzSprout\n\r\nHandling intro and outro, audio leveling, and removing the stuff that doesn't need to be there\n\r\n\n\r\nYouTube Production - \n\r\nEditing the same Zoom recording into a polished, watchable YouTube video\n\r\nTitles, descriptions, and basic SEO thinking to help the content get found\n\r\nUnderstanding what makes someone keep watching, not just click\n\r\nCreate eye catching YouTube thumbnails for each video\n\r\nUsing brand aligned b-roll for the edits\n\r\n\n\r\nShort-Form Reels and Clips - \n\r\nPulling the most compelling, thought-provoking \nnts from each episode\n\r\nEditing into short-form vertical content for Instagram, TikTok, and\n\r\nAdding captions, light graphics, b-roll, or text overlays as needed\n\r\nThis is where your instincts really matter. We need someone who can feel what will stop the scroll.\n\r\nYouTube Strategy and Growth\n\r\nBringing ideas and insight to help both channels grow over time\n\r\nStaying current on what is working on YouTube and short-form video\n\r\nThinking beyond just editing and into how content connects with the right audience\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTech We Use - \n\r\n\n\r\nThese are the tools across both brands. You do not need to know them all, but the video and audio ones are important for this role. We are happy to train the right person where needed, so do not let an unfamiliar tool keep you from reaching out.\n\r\n\n\r\nCore for This Role:\n\r\nDescript\n\r\nAudacity\n\r\nZoom\n\r\nCapcut\n\r\nBuzzSprout\n\r\nYouTube\n\r\nCanva\n\r\nInstagram / TikTok /\n\r\nAsana\n\r\n\r\nLoom\n\r\n\n\r\nAlso in Our World:\n\r\nKajabi\n\r\nShopify\n\r\nGoogle Suite\n\r\nMicrosoft Office Suite\n\r\nHello Audio\n\r\nPinterest\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We Are Looking For -\n\r\n\n\r\nSkills matter a lot for this one, but so does brand awareness and alignment. We need someone who can watch or listen to a conversation about herbs and instinctively know which thirty seconds is going to make someone stop, watch, and share.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou have a genuine feel for natural health, herbalism, or holistic living. You do not have to be a herbalist, but this world should resonate with you.\n\r\nYou are a strong video editor who understands pacing, storytelling, and what holds attention.\n\r\nYou think like a YouTube viewer, not just an editor.\n\r\nYou are a self-starter who brings ideas, not just deliverables.\n\r\nYou care about details. A jump cut that is a frame too long or a caption that is slightly off bothers you.\n\r\nYou communicate clearly, ask good questions, and are easy to work with across distance.\n\r\nYou want a long-term creative partnership, not a one-off project.\n\r\nYou want to live and breathe the brands when you work for us.\n\r\n\n\r\nA note on AI: we use it as a tool, and we are fine with you doing the same where it makes sense. But we do not want AI-generated content standing in for genuine creative judgment. The human eye, ear, and instinct are what we are hiring.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply - \n\r\n\n\r\nWe read every reply, and we notice when people are actually paying attention.\n\r\n\n\r\n1- In your subject line or at the very top of your reply: TELL US YOUR FAVORITE FLOWER. Replies without this will not be read. It is our way of knowing you made it all the way through.\n\r\n\n\r\n2- Share a clip or video you edited that you are genuinely proud of, and tell us in one or two sentences why it works. We want to see how you think, not just what you can do.\n\r\n\n\r\n3- Tell us what draws you to the world of herbs and natural health, even just a little. This does not need to be a long answer. Just something real.\n\r\n\n\r\nBeyond that, just introduce yourself, tell us what you do, and include any relevant links or portfolio samples.\n\r\n\n\r\nThanks for taking the time.\n\r\nSo excited to meet you!\n\r\n\n\r\nMel - The Herbalist's Path | Eclectic Herb                ",

You've grown Amazon stores organically, mastered listings, PPC, SEO, A+ content, and understand how to move inventory smartly. \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou live for performance, obsess over numbers, and know what levers to pull to make things sell.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're clear in communication, fast on execution, and act like you own the brand — because we’ll treat you like part of the team, not a hired gun.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Own:\n\r\nYou’ll take full control of our Amazon and PPC accounts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll optimize listings like a pro — from backend keywords and bullet points to images and titles.\n\r\nYou’ll launch ads that convert and scale.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll move fast, adjust quicker, and stay data-driven every step of the way.\n\r\nAnd most importantly, you’ll work directly with us — no fluff, no layers, no wasted time.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Is Different:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re not an agency.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re a real brand with products that sell, reviews that matter, and customers coming back.

I run a boutique, private-pay acupuncture and Chinese medicine clinic that provides high-touch, concierge-level care to our patients.\n\r\n\n\r\nI am looking for a warm, reliable, and proactive Healthcare Virtual Assistant to serve as my patient coordinator and right-hand assistant. This is a long-term, high-trust role where you will support both clinic operations and light personal administrative tasks while helping create a smooth, professional, and caring patient experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT a call center role.\n\r\nThis is a concierge-style healthcare environment where patients return regularly and build relationships with the clinic. Over time, you will get to know our patients and become a consistent, professional point of contact for them.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Role:\n\r\n\n\r\nI am a solo practitioner, full-time clinician, business owner, content creator, and mother. I am the only person running 3-4 treatments/hour. No physical person at front desk, so I need a dependable assistant who can help me stay organized, efficient, and one step ahead while I focus on treating patients in person.\n\r\n\n\r\nDaily task volume is generally light, but the role requires:\n\r\n\n\r\n-Responsiveness\n\r\n-Warm communication\n\r\n-Attention to detail\n\r\n-Proactive support\n\r\n-Professionalism at all times\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Concierge-Level Patient Experience (Key Expectation)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe provide personalized, high-touch care. Patients are often in pain, nervous, or new to acupuncture, so communication must always be:\n\r\n\n\r\n-Warm\n\r\n-Calm\n\r\n-Professional\n\r\n-Empathetic\n\r\n-Clear and organized\n\r\n-You will speak with patients on calls, texts, and\n, so strong spoken English and a reassuring tone are essential.\n\r\n\n\r\nPatients should feel cared for, not processed. I do not need to close sales, the patients seek treatment and close themselves. \n\r\n\n\r\n???? CORE RESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\n\n\r\nPatient Coordination & Front Desk (Primary)\n\r\nAnswer incoming patient calls (OpenPhone)\n\r\nRespond to new patient inquiries (text/email)\n\r\nSchedule appointments accurately\n\r\nCollect patient information (name, phone,\n, reason for visit)\n\r\nSend confirmations, reminders, and follow-ups\n\r\nEnsure intake forms are completed on time\n\r\nMaintain warm, professional communication\n\r\nBe the first impression of the clinic from first inquiry to booking\n\r\nLight weekend inbox monitoring (1–2 checks per day, asynchronous)\n\r\n\n\r\n(NO cold calling. NO sales. NO medical advice.)\n\r\n\n\r\nClinic Operations & Efficiency Support:\n\r\n\n\r\nLearn and use JaneApp (training provided)\n\r\nAudit schedule for completeness and accuracy\n\r\nFlag incomplete bookings or missing forms\n\r\nMaintain organized communication records\n\r\nHelp improve front desk workflows and efficiency\n\r\nDevelop and update SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)\n\r\nDocument systems and processes as the clinic grows\n\r\n\n\r\nRight-Hand & Personal Administrative Support\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a hybrid role. In addition to clinic coordination, you will also provide light personal assistant support to help reduce my mental workload.\n\r\n\n\r\nExamples:\n\r\nInbox organization and prioritization\n\r\nCalendar coordination and reminders\n\r\nDocument and workflow organization\n\r\nTemplate drafting for common responses\n\r\nAdministrative organization tasks\n\r\nOccasional research and coordination support\n\r\n\n\r\nOptional Growth Opportunity (Long-Term)\n\r\nFor the right candidate, hours and responsibilities may grow over time to include:\n\r\nLight social media organization/creation (if you're a creative, this is a bonus)\n\r\nContent scheduling support\n\r\nOrganizing files and content ideas\n\r\nAdditional operational support as the clinic expands\n\r\n\n\r\n? Hours, Schedule & Stability\n\r\n-Weekly pay\n\r\n-Availability required during U.S. EST clinic hours for responsiveness\n\r\n-Light weekend inbox monitoring (asynchronous)\n\r\n-Hours may increase to 12–15+ per week as the role grows\n\r\n-Some weeks may be lighter in task volume, but responsiveness, professionalism, and proactive support are still expected.\n\r\n-Even during lighter weeks or schedule changes, a minimum of agreed guaranteed hours will be maintained for the right long-term assistant as I value trust and relationships, but only once loyalty and consistently is established\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nBecause this is a patient-facing, concierge-style healthcare role, a short video is required as part of the application.\n\r\nPlease submit a 1–3 minute video introducing yourself and answering the prompts below.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your video, please:\n\r\n\n\r\nIntroduce yourself (name, location, and work experience)\n\r\nTell me what you enjoy doing for fun outside of work\n\r\nShare your top 3 personal values in life (not work-related)\n\r\nExplain why you believe you would be a great fit for this role\n\r\nSpeak as if you are answering a new patient calling a clinic for the first time (warm and professional tone)\n\r\nThis helps me understand your communication style, personality, and spoken English, which are very important for this role.\n\r\nApplications without a video will NOT be considered.

    "description": "\n                    JOB TITLE: Short-Form Video Editor — AI Content Creator, Instagram/TikTok\n\r\nSALARY: $1,100 USD/month\n\r\nTYPE: Full-time (40 hours/week)\n\r\nLOCATION: Remote (Philippines)\n\r\nSCHEDULE: Async, with Vancouver overlap (PST) for feedback\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE MISSION\n\r\n\n\r\nPrismiera is a luxury jewelry brand with a short-form video series already producing cinematic content on YouTube — mythology, history, goddess archetypes, and Dark Academia aesthetics.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone to own the Instagram and TikTok side.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT repurposing YouTube content into different aspect ratios. This is building platform-native content that makes a woman feel powerful in under 20 seconds. You'll create original short-form edits and cinematic skits using AI-generated footage, voiceovers, and atmospheric visuals — designed from the ground up for how Instagram and TikTok audiences actually consume.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe other half of this role: you'll be working with our AI-generated personas who serve as the visual anchor across our short-form content. You'll generate, composite, integrate, and stylize AI character visuals into edits that feel striking and intentional, not gimmicky. If the idea of building a visual identity around an AI persona excites you, keep reading!\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE STYLE\n\r\n\n\r\nThe content mix you'll produce:\n\r\n\n\r\n65% VIBE & SCENARIO — The kind of reel a woman sends to her group chat with no caption because the vibe speaks for itself.\n\r\n\n\r\n25% CINEMATIC SKITS — High-end, visually stunning executions of viral formats and dark humor. The premise can be slightly unhinged or ironic, but the visuals never break luxury. Think high-end perfume commercial meets TikTok audio trend. The Goddess is never the butt of the joke — she's the punchline, and she always wins.\n\r\n\n\r\n10% SENSORY / EXPERIMENTAL — Layered, fast, loop-optimized. Visual overload with mythological texture. The algorithmic wildcard.\n\r\n\n\r\nYES: Aspirational. Lethal elegance. Fashion-edit energy. Dark femininity. Music-driven impact. Content that feels like a luxury car reel meets ancient mythology. Cinematic skits using our AI personas — high-production value, deadpan, surreal, or darkly ironic.\n\r\n\n\r\nNO: CapCut presets. Generic motivational quote reels. Low-effort vlog-style acting. Slapstick comedy. Anything that looks like it was made in Canva. Anything that cheapens a demi-luxury product.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\n\n\r\nCreate & Adapt: Produce original Instagram/TikTok-native content using AI-generated visuals, trending audio, and our brand's mythology. Some pieces you'll build from scratch. Others you'll adapt from assets in our YouTube production pipeline. Either way, you're not resizing — you're crafting content shaped for how each platform rewards engagement.\n\r\n\n\r\nCinematic Skits: Build short-form skits around our AI personas that use trending formats, dark humor, or deadpan irony — executed at a visual level that never drops below luxury. People share it for the joke, follow the page for the aesthetic.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Persona Integration: Composite and stylize our AI-generated characters into edits as a visual anchor. She's not a narrator in your content — she's the presence. The face the eye locks onto while mythology and music layers move around her.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Content Generation: You won't just receive AI assets — you'll create them. Using tools like Seedance 2.0 and Seedream, you'll generate goddess visuals, atmospheric environments, and character footage that feed directly into your edits. You're both the director and the editor.\n\r\n\n\r\nMusic-Sync Editing: Your cuts, transitions, and visual reveals are married to the beat. You understand rhythm as a storytelling tool. Swells, drops, silence, impact — all intentional.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlatform Instinct: You understand what Instagram rewards vs. what TikTok rewards. You know what gets saved on IG. You know what gets looped on TikTok. You design for those behaviors, not just for visual quality.\n\r\n\n\r\nInstagram Packaging: Beyond the Reel itself — you contribute to grid cohesion, caption strategy, and Story sequencing. The profile should make someone think \"I want to be part of this\" within 2 seconds of landing.\n\r\n\n\r\nVolume at Speed: Once your templates and aesthetic are locked, your turnaround per piece should be significantly faster than building from zero. We expect high output.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nCORE REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter Effects (Strong Plus). Compositing, layering, motion graphics, light/shadow matching. If you have these skills, they'll set you apart. If you don't, strong AI generation skills and visual instinct can compensate.\n\r\n\n\r\nPremiere Pro. For project handoffs and consistency with the rest of the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Generation Fluency. This is not optional. You'll be using frontier AI tools daily — not just editing AI output, but generating it. You'll learn to prompt, iterate, select, and refine AI-generated visuals as a core part of your production workflow. We provide paid accounts for all tools (Seedance 2.0, Seedream, and whatever launches next). What we need is someone who treats these tools as creative instruments, not novelties.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Aesthetic Eye. You instinctively know the difference between aspirational and try-hard. Between elegant and overproduced. Between powerful and loud. Your edits make people feel something before they consciously understand what they're looking at.\n\r\n\n\r\nMusic & Rhythm. You've made edits where the music drives the visuals — AMVs, fashion reels, phonk edits, fan edits, whatever. You understand pacing as a weapon. You know what \"the drop\" means and you know when NOT to use it.\n\r\n\n\r\nLoop Thinking. You design edits that reward rewatching. The cut that lands on beat, the detail you only catch the second time, the seamless loop point. You think in circles, not lines.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong English. Daily async communication — clear, direct, professional.\n\r\n\n\r\nReliable & Coachable. You hit deadlines or warn early. You take direct feedback and iterate fast. You flag problems with options, not excuses.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nBONUS SKILLS (Not Required, But We'll Notice)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Color grading — pushing AI output and mixed footage into a consistent luxury palette\n\r\n- Typography sense — text overlays that feel intentional and premium\n\r\n- Sound design — SFX layering beyond just music (risers, hits, atmospheric texture)\n\r\n- Carousel / static design for Instagram companion posts\n\r\n- Understanding of Instagram analytics — saves, shares, completion rates, and what drives them\n\r\n- Experience building visual identities for brands or personas on social media\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWEEKLY OUTPUT\n\r\n\n\r\n3–5 pieces as you learn the brand aesthetic, lock your editing templates, learn the AI generation tools, and calibrate with the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nSteady state: 10–15 pieces per week across Instagram and TikTok — a mix of original productions and asset-based adaptations depending on the content calendar.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW THIS ROLE FITS\n\r\n\n\r\nOther editors handle cinematic YouTube production and visual effects — you own social media. Same mythology, same brand, different platform behavior. Each editor has a distinct lane, and yours is how Prismiera looks and feels on Instagram and TikTok.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nRAM: 16GB minimum (32GB preferred) + SSD\n\r\nReliable high-speed internet (upload speed matters)\n\r\nMust run video editing software and browser-based AI tools simultaneously\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nPAID TRIAL (Shortlisted Candidates)\n\r\n\n\r\nBefore any full-time commitment, we run a weekly paid trial. We provide real assets from our production pipeline, style references, and the AI persona visuals. You deliver content. Trial is compensated at $250 USD at the end of each week. If it's a mutual fit after 30 days, we transition to regular bi-weekly payments (before work).\n\r\n\n\r\nThis protects both sides — you see whether the work fits your strengths, we see whether the output fits our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\r\n\n\r\n- Paid accounts for all frontier AI tools — Seedance 2.0, Seedream, and whatever launches next\n\r\n- Creative ownership — you're defining how a luxury brand looks and feels on Instagram and TikTok from day one\n\r\n- An AI persona to build around — not a hypothetical, an active visual identity you'll shape and evolve\n\r\n- A role that evolves as the tools evolve — this job will look different in six months, and that's the point\n\r\n- Clear briefs — asset libraries, mood references, and specific direction for every batch\n\r\n- Direct feedback — specific, constructive notes on every edit\n\r\n- A brand worth building — Prismiera launches soon. A second AI-native brand is incubating behind it. You're not joining a finished machine. You're helping build one.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION\n\r\n\n\r\n$1,100 USD/month. Paid trial at $250 USD/week, transitioning to bi-weekly payments of $550 (before work) after 30 days.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nOWNERSHIP & CONFIDENTIALITY\n\r\n\n\r\nAll outputs (edits, project files, prompts, generated assets, persona visuals) are Prismiera property and must remain confidential.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a generic cover letter.\n\r\nUse 7 apply points or more when applying.\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: PRISMIERA SOCIAL — [Your Name]\n\r\n\n\r\nSend the following (in this order):\n\r\n\n\r\n1. The Vibe Test. Link to ONE edit you've made that is aspirational, aesthetic, or fashion-adjacent — or a skit that demonstrates platform-native virality instinct. Format doesn't matter. The feeling does.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. The Rhythm Test. Link to ONE edit where the music drives the visuals. Show us your beat-sync instinct. (Can overlap with #1 if one video demonstrates both.)\n\r\n\n\r\n3. The Creative Instinct Test (3–5 sentences total). You're given a 45-second cinematic video about a queen who poisoned her entire court, a folder of our AI Goddess visuals, and a dark atmospheric beat. Pitch two reworks: (A) a 15-second Instagram Reel designed to get saved — tell us your audio choice, pacing, and what the first 2 seconds look like; and (B) a 15-second cinematic skit that uses dark or deadpan humor without losing the luxury feel.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. AI Experience (1–2 sentences). What is your experience level with generative AI tools? If none, say so — we'll evaluate the rest on its own merits.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Hardware. Your PC specs: CPU / GPU / RAM. Plus your internet upload speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Turnaround Estimate. Given existing footage, a music track, and an established editing template — how long would a 15–20 second piece take you?\n\r\n\n\r\n7. The Rewrite. Rewrite this sentence to sound dark, powerful, and aspirational: \"She is really cool and strong and she wins.\"                ",

    "description": "\n                    About the Business\n\r\n\n\r\nI am a former content creator who has built a growing food media company. The business now operates as a publishing operation — we run a large recipe website,\n newsletter, and multiple social media channels.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe creative side of the business is already covered. We have two tea\nmbers focused on content production and media, and I remain involved as the owner and creative lead.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we lack is operational structure.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe workflow currently relies too much on manual coordination, memory, and informal processes. We need someone who is comfortable stepping into a messy environment and turning it into an organized system.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work closely with me to establish clear workflows, documentation, and accountability so the business can operate reliably without constant oversight.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is best suited for someone who enjoys creating order, building procedures, and maintaining organized systems. It is not a creative or social media management position.\n\r\n\n\r\nFull-time Remote — Long-term role\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will act as the operational engine of the company by building out our ClickUp system, writing detailed SOPs and understanding every last detail of the business workflows until everything is documented. Once the system is estabished, you will be responsible for maintaining the workflow and following up with tea\nmbers to ensure we meet the critical path. You are not a manager though, and are not responsible for interpersonal development or people management. Your role is only to ensure the workflows are followed, deadlines met, and you should always be looking for ways to improve efficiency and revenue.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Primary Responsibility\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will own how work moves through the business.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour goal:\n\r\nEvery task has a clear path, no step is forgotten, and the team always knows what happens next.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will turn a creator-led workflow into a repeatable publishing operation.\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Areas You Will Manage\n\r\n1) Workflow & ClickUp Systems (Core of the Role)\n\r\n\n\r\nDesign and maintain our ClickUp workspace\n\r\n\n\r\nBuild structured pipelines for content production\n\r\n\n\r\nCreate task templates, checklists, and recurring processes\n\r\n\n\r\nTrack progress of all content\n\r\n\n\r\nFollow up on deadlines and incomplete tasks\n\r\n\n\r\nPrevent bottlenecks before they occur\n\r\n\n\r\nMaintain file organization and naming standards\n\r\n\n\r\nDocument SOPs (standard operating procedures)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must already be comfortable using ClickUp in a real work environment.\n\r\n\n\r\n2) Process Improvement & Automation\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will continuously improve how the business operates.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis includes:\n\r\n\n\r\nidentifying repetitive manual work\n\r\n\n\r\nsimplifying processes\n\r\n\n\r\nproposing automation solutions\n\r\n\n\r\nconnecting tools and workflows\n\r\n\n\r\nreducing dependence on manual reminders\n\r\n\n\r\nimproving operational reliability\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are specifically looking for someone who naturally asks:\n\r\n“Can this be systemized?”\n\r\n\n\r\n3) Publishing Operations & Website Health (WordPress)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are not responsible for writing or publishing blog posts.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are responsible for managing the structure and operational health of the website.\n\r\n\n\r\nResponsibilities include:\n\r\n\n\r\nmaintaining the publishing schedule\n\r\n\n\r\nchecking posts after publication\n\r\n\n\r\nreviewing internal linking between articles\n\r\n\n\r\nupdating homepage

structure\n\r\n\n\r\nflagging technical issues\n\r\n\n\r\nYou do not need to be a developer, but you must be comfortable learning WordPress and understanding how a content website functions.\n\r\n\n\r\n4) Analytics, Trends & Performance Tracking\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will monitor performance and help guide operational decisions.\n\r\n\n\r\nResponsibilities:\n\r\n\n\r\ntrack traffic and RPM trends\n\r\n\n\r\nmonitor publishing consistency\n\r\n\n\r\ntrack affiliate link performance\n\r\n\n\r\nanalyze which topics perform best\n\r\n\n\r\nprepare weekly performance

    "description": "\n                    ABOUT THIS PROJECT:\n\r\n\n\r\nI am looking for someone who is focused on innovation, trends, and the \"what's next\" in the design world. I am NOT looking for someone who creates designs for corporate brands or standard marketing materials that can't break that mold. Must be able to break the marketing mold and instead develop designs that communicate a feeling and are \"looks\" forward. Your portfolio MUST show this and your ability to develop cool projects not just corporate used assets. I'm an experienced Art Director and Graphic Designer based in the U.S. looking to build a standout portfolio that truly reflects the caliber of my work. The problem isn't the work — it's the time. I'm buried in client projects and need a talented, senior-level creative partner to take everything I've already designed and transform it into a polished, dynamic, and visually impressive portfolio website and project presentation system.\n\r\nThis is not a task-taking role. I want a true collaborator — someone who will absorb my vision, contribute their own creative ideas, push back when they have a better solution, and help elevate the final result beyond what either of us could do alone.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Website: \nv or Comparable Platform (This Is Critical)\n\r\nMy portfolio site is currently being built on \nv, an AI-powered web design platform, and this piece of the project is just as important as the design work itself. Here's why this matters so much: once the project is complete, I need to be able to manage, edit, and add to the site myself — without hiring a developer every time I want to swap out a project or update a section. \nv makes this possible through its AI chat-based editing interface, which lets non-developers make real changes without touching code. If you are experienced with \nv, you move to the top of the list immediately.\n\r\nThat said, I am open to other platforms — but only if they meet the same criteria:\n\r\n- The site must be a real, live, published website (not a mockup or template PDF)\n\r\n- I must be able to edit and add to it myself after handoff without needing to rehire\n\r\n- It should support a visually rich, modern, and dynamic design — not a cookie-cutter template look\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're proposing an alternative to \nv, tell me specifically what platform you'd use, why it's better for this project, and how it gives me the same self-service editing capability. I'm open to the conversation — just come with a clear recommendation and reasoning.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Taking my existing design files (print, social, logo/branding, vector assets, etc.) across multiple campaigns and brands and building cohesive, story-driven project presentations\n\r\n- Placing designs onto high-quality 4K photorealistic mockups so the work comes to life beyond flat files\n\r\n- Crafting visual storyboards and case study layouts that communicate the creative strategy and execution behind each project\n\r\n- Building and publishing the actual portfolio website on \nv or an agreed-upon alternative that meets the self-editing requirement\n\r\n- Incorporating motion graphics or subtle animations to make the portfolio feel modern and dynamic (AI-assisted motion is acceptable)\n\r\n- Maintaining a strong understanding of American design culture and what resonates with U.S.-based hiring teams and creative directors\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Senior-level graphic design experience — strong eye and deep experience across branding, print, and digital\n\r\n- Mockup & presentation design — expert-level ability to composite designs onto 4K realistic mockups and build compelling case study layouts\n\r\n- Web design AND development — you need to build a real, live, published site, not just design it in Figma and call it done\n\r\n- \nv experience — strongly preferred; if you have it, lead with it\n\r\n- Motion graphics / animation — at minimum, comfortable using AI tools to add movement and life to portfolio pieces\n\r\n- AI design tools — proficient with AI-powered design workflows (Higgsfield, Nano Banana Pro, Firefly, or similar)\n\r\n- Strong grasp of American aesthetics and design culture — this portfolio targets U.S. companies and hiring directors, so your sensibility needs to reflect that\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT I AM NOT LOOKING FOR:\n\r\n\n\r\nA \"yes person.\" I don't want someone who just executes instructions. I want someone who reviews my inspiration, understands the goal, and brings their own strong creative perspective to the table. If you have a better idea, say so.\n\r\n\n\r\nPROJECT TIMELINE AND COMMUNICATION:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Target completion: 4–8 weeks depending on scope and workflow speed\n\r\n- Weekly check-ins via video call or messaging to review progress and align on direction\n\r\n- Responsive communication is required — I need to know things are moving                ",

Starting rate depends on experience and operational expertise).\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n???? About STX Promo & Our Growth:\n\r\n\n\r\nSTX Promo helps businesses and organizations Step Up Their Setup with eye-catching custom canopies, table covers, flags, banners, and more. We work with small businesses, schools, and nonprofits across the U.S. to elevate their brand presence at events and trade shows.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are growing incredibly fast. Over the last 10 months alone, we’ve added 4 people to our core team along with several specialized gig workers. As we gear up for our busiest season yet, our current Sales and Production Coordinator is handling a massive volume of orders. We are actively hiring a second full-time coordinator to jump into the trenches, split the workload, and help us maintain our pro-level communication and zero-hassle client experience.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n???? About the Role: Your Impact:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for a heavy hitter. We need a highly organized, proactive Sales & Production Coordinator who specializes in Client and Vendor Relations and Process Optimization.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn this role, you are the crucial bridge between our U.S. clients, our internal design team, and our manufacturing suppliers. Because we are growing so quickly, our backend operations need to evolve. We are looking for someone who brings strong operational insights to the table—someone who can look at how we currently do things, identify bottlenecks, and help us build more efficient, error-proof workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities:\n\r\n\n\r\nWorkflow Optimization: Actively analyze and improve our backend processes. Bring fresh ideas to the table on how to best utilize ClickUp, Shopify, and Gmail to maximize our team's efficiency and minimize costly mistakes.\n\r\n\n\r\nClient Relations: Manage daily incoming sales and customer service\ns (via Gmail) and handle live chat inquiries, utilizing AI tools (ChatGPT/Gemini) to draft efficient, professional responses.\n\r\n\n\r\nVendor Management: Place precise orders through various supplier portals. Proactively follow up on order statuses, track estimated delivery times, and troubleshoot any delays directly with vendors.\n\r\n\n\r\nProduction Coordination: Collaborate heavily with our Graphic Design team. You will confirm print graphics with clients, ensure mockups align with expectations, and prepare final files for supplier handoff.\n\r\n\n\r\nWorkflow Tracking: Organize and communicate project priorities using ClickUp to track progress and strict deadlines. Maintain organized client files within Google Drive.\n\r\n\n\r\nTeam Sync: Communicate efficiently with the internal team on a daily basis via WhatsApp.\n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule & Light Weekend Rotation: Work a consistent Monday–Friday U.S. daytime schedule. You won't have to work every weekend. You will split a light weekend inbox rotation with our current coordinator (e.g., alternating weekends or splitting Saturday/Sunday). This is just a quick check-in to ensure clients aren't left hanging. Many clients shop around on weekends—by replying quickly while our competitors wait until Monday, we win the deal!\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n? You're a Great Fit If You Have:\n\r\n\n\r\nTop-Tier English & US Culture Match: Proven experience working directly with a U.S.-based company. You must possess a strong understanding of American business communication, tone, and customer expectations. (This is a massive differentiator for us—your English must be impeccable).\n\r\n\n\r\nOperational Mindset: You aren't just an order-taker; you are a problem solver who naturally looks for ways to make systems run smoother and faster.\n\r\n\n\r\nVendor/Client Experience: A solid background in managing supplier relationships and keeping clients happy, especially when dealing with physical products and shipping deadlines.\n\r\n\n\r\nExtreme Attention to Detail: One wrong measurement or file upload can ruin a print job. You must be hyper-vigilant when approving graphics and placing orders.\n\r\n\n\r\nGrace Under Pressure: You thrive in a fast-paced environment, can juggle multiple priorities at once, and keep your cool during the \"busy season.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nReliability: A stable internet connection and a concrete backup plan for power or internet outages.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n? Bonus Points If You Also Have:\n\r\n\n\r\nPrior experience or understanding of the promotional products industry, large-format printing, or design files (e.g., bleed, CMYK, vectors).\n\r\n\n\r\nHands-on experience managing orders within Shopify.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n???? How to Apply (Please Read Carefully):\n\r\n\n\r\nAttention to detail starts here. To ensure your application stands out, please submit the following:\n\r\nYour updated Resume/CV.\n\r\n\n\r\nA short written note answering these three questions:\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat specific experience do you have managing US-based clients and interacting with third-party vendors/suppliers?\n\r\n\n\r\nHave you ever worked with print or design files before? If so, please briefly describe your experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy do you believe you would truly thrive in this fast-paced, high-volume role, and how do you approach making workflows more efficient?\n\r\n\n\r\n(Note: If your application is shortlisted, Step 2 of our interview process will be to submit a quick 2-minute video or voice intro so we can get to know you better!)\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications missing any of the requirements above will be automatically filtered out and will not be reviewed. We look forward to reviewing your application and finding the next crucial member of our growing team!                ",

    "description": "\n                    Keep customers. Save the sale. Protect the revenue.\n\r\nDepartment:  Customer Experience & Revenue\n\r\nType:  Full-Time | Remote\n\r\nReports To:  Customer Service Manager\n\r\nCompensation:  Base + Save-Rate Bonus\n\r\nLocation:  Philippines (preferred)\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT AJ MEDIA\n\r\nAJ Media is a performance-driven ecommerce growth agency scaling three consumer brands — Gekko Gifts, Purvos, and Besyner — toward $100M. We move fast, we're obsessed with numbers, and every role on this team has a direct impact on revenue. This one is no different.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT THIS ROLE ACTUALLY IS\n\r\nThis is NOT an\n marketing or automation role. This is a phone-first, people-first retention position. Your job is to get on a call with a customer who wants a refund — and convince them to stay.\n\r\nEvery day, customers reach out wanting to cancel, return, or request a refund. Most companies just process it and move on. We don't. We believe every refund request is a conversation that hasn't happened yet — and that the right person, with the right approach, can turn a cancellation into a loyal customer.\n\r\nThat person is you.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll handle inbound retention contacts — calls, chats, and\ns — from customers on the fence. Your goal is to understand why they want to leave, meet them with genuine empathy, and present the right offer (whether that's a discount, a replacement, an upgrade, or just being heard) to keep them. You're not a script-reader. You're a problem-solver and a closer.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\nHandle inbound refund and cancellation requests via phone, live chat, and\n — with speed and warmth\n\r\nIdentify the real reason a customer wants to leave (it's rarely the stated reason) through active listening\n\r\nPresent personalized retention offers including stacking discounts, store credit, product exchanges, or partial refunds\n\r\nNegotiate win-win outcomes: protect company revenue while making the customer feel genuinely valued\n\r\nEscalate edge cases appropriately while owning the majority of cases independently\n\r\nLog every interaction in the CRM with outcome, offer used, and root cause of the contact\n\r\nTrack your own save rate, refund prevention rate, and average discount offered daily\n\r\nFlag recurring product or service issues causing refund spikes to the operations team\n\r\nContribute to the playbook: document what works, what doesn't, and which offers convert best\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO YOU ARE\n\r\nYou have 1–3 years of experience in customer service, inbound sales, or phone-based support — ideally in ecommerce or DTC\n\r\nYou're a natural people person — warm, confident, and genuinely persuasive without being pushy\n\r\nYou can handle an angry or frustrated customer and de-escalate without losing your composure\n\r\nYou know how to listen first, and how to present an offer at exactly the right \nnt in a conversation\n\r\nYou're comfortable with silence, hesitation, and objections — you don't fold when a customer pushes back\n\r\nYou're driven by outcomes: save rates, refund prevention, CSAT — these numbers matter to you\n\r\nYou take ownership. If a customer leaves unhappy, you replay the conversation and ask what you could have done differently\n\r\nYou're organized, reliable, and consistent — the team can count on you to show up and perform every day\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE SKILL SET THAT WINS IN THIS ROLE\n\r\nCore skills:\n\r\nPhone and live chat customer handling at volume\n\r\nActive listening and root-cause discovery in a conversation\n\r\nObjection handling and counter-offer delivery\n\r\nStacking discounts and retention offer construction\n\r\nDe-escalation of frustrated or emotional customers\n\r\nCRM and helpdesk tools (Gorgias, Shopify, or similar)\n\r\nSoft skills that separate good from great:\n\r\nEmpathy that feels real — not scripted or transactional\n\r\nResilience — you can take a hard call, reset, and go again\n\r\nSales instinct — you know when to hold and when to close\n\r\nClear, calm communication under pressure\n\r\nCuriosity about why customers behave the way they do\n\r\n\n\r\nTHIS ROLE IS NOT FOR YOU IF\n\r\nYou're looking for a behind-the-scenes\n or automation role — that's a different position. This role requires confident, real-time human conversations on phone and chat. Every. Day.\n\r\nYou prefer working async without real-time customer interaction\n\r\nYou get stressed or shut down when customers are upset or demanding\n\r\nYou process refunds without attempting to retain the customer\n\r\nYou need a heavily scripted environment to feel confident in a conversation\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY JOIN US\n\r\nSave-rate bonus — the more customers you retain, the more you earn\n\r\nClear daily metrics: your impact is visible, measurable, and recognized\n\r\nFast career path into CS Team Lead or Retention Manager for top performers\n\r\nWork directly with experienced ecommerce operators who invest in your growth\n\r\n100% remote — work from the Philippines, on a schedule aligned with our brand customer hours\n\r\nA team that treats retention as a revenue function, not a support afterthought\n\r\n\n\r\nSound like you?  Apply with your CV and a video introduction telling us about a time you talked someone out of a decision they'd already made. We want to hear how you think and how you communicate — not just read your resume.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAPPLY HERE: \n                ",

    "description": "\n                    About Us\n\r\nWe’re a programming education company that helps experienced software engineers build real-world Rust projects and land Rust roles. We run a high-ticket, cohort-based accelerator plus self-paced training, and reach engineers through YouTube,\n, and partnerships.\n\r\n\n\r\nRole Overview\n\r\nWe are looking for a part-time Meta Ads Operator to implement and maintain our\n and Instagram campaigns. This is an execution-focused role: you will take clear targeting and creative direction from the founder and marketing team, then handle setup, tracking, and ongoing optimizations inside Meta Ads Manager.\n\r\n\n\r\nIdeal for someone who enjoys clean accounts, accurate tracking, and making data-driven tweaks, not sitting in branding meetings.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\n1. Implement and maintain Meta Pixel and Conversion API across our funnels (waitlist, applications, bookings, purchases).\n\r\n2. Set up campaigns, ad sets, and ads according to provided specs (objectives, budgets, audiences, and creatives).\n\r\n3. Create and manage custom and lookalike audiences from our traffic,\n list, and engaged users.\n\r\n4. Monitor performance daily on weekdays and execute simple rules: pause obvious losers, keep winners within defined guardrails, and flag issues quickly.\n\r\n5. Run basic A/B tests on creatives and audiences following our testing framework.\n\r\n6. Ensure tracking events fire correctly on all key steps and troubleshoot when they do not.\n\r\n7. Produce a concise weekly report (spend, cost per waitlist opt-in, cost per application, cost per call, cost per student) with 2 to 3 clear recommendations.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou Are A Good Fit If\n\r\n1. You have 1 to 3 years of hands-on experience running Meta Ads (lead gen or info/education experience is a plus).\n\r\n2. You are comfortable with Meta Ads Manager, Pixel, standard events, and basic CAPI.\n\r\n3. You can read numbers and make simple performance-based decisions without drama.\n\r\n4. You are organized, responsive, and document what you do so others can follow it.\n\r\n5. You can overlap at least 2 to 3 hours per day with US time zones.\n\r\n6. You’re currently freelancing or working part time and want a long term core client, not just a one-off project.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis Role Is Not\n\r\n1. Not a creative director or copywriter (we have a content and\n team).\n\r\n2. Not a CMO or growth strategist d\n offers, funnels, or pricing.\n\r\n3. Not a general social media manager (no organic posting, community management, or influencer work).\n\r\n\n\r\nScope & Engagement\n\r\n1. Part-time contractor.\n\r\n2. We’ll start at 5–10 hours/week for the first 60–90 days while we validate and scale Meta.\n\r\n3. We guarantee a minimum of 20 hours/month, paid monthly, so your time is predictable.\n\r\n4. If performance is strong and we scale ad spend, this role can grow into 15–20+ hours/week and potentially a full-time PH position.\n\r\n5. Remote, flexible schedule as long as SLAs are met and campaigns are monitored on weekdays.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow To Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease reply to this job post with the following:\n\r\n1. A brief summary of your Meta Ads experience, including typical monthly budgets.\n\r\n2. Screenshots or summaries of 2 to 3 campaigns you have managed (goal, budget, structure, and results).\n\r\n3. One paragraph on how you normally set up tracking (pixel, events, CAPI) for a lead gen funnel.\n\r\n4. Your part-time hourly rate and full-time monthly rate, respectively.                ",
