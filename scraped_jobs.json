We are looking to hire correctly. If you believe your experience, communication skills, and work ethic make you a strong fit — apply.

    "description": "\n                    About Us\n\r\nWe are a U.S.-based AI video production company located in Rhode Island. We serve clients in real estate, insurance, brand storytelling, and character-driven animation. We've been in video production since 2019 and have worked with high-profile clients across multiple industries.\n\r\nThis is a permanent, salaried position with daily work. We have long-term client partnerships that guarantee consistent production year-round. We are building a team — not cycling through freelancers.\n\r\nAbout the salary range: We listed a wide range because we're open to different experience levels. If you're a strong traditional editor who's eager to grow into AI video, we'll start you at a fair rate and invest in your development. If you're already producing broadcast-quality AI video and can hit the ground running, we'll pay accordingly — up to $3,500/month for the right person. We believe in paying well for excellent work.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Job Is Different\n\r\nWe provide ALL AI tools and software subscriptions. You will not need to pay for any AI video platforms out of pocket. Once you're part of the team, we give you full access to the tools you need — including platforms like Sora, VEO, Kling, Runway, Pika, HeyGen, and others as needed. We also provide Adobe Creative Cloud if required.\n\r\nWe know these tools are expensive. We invest in our team so you can focus on doing great work instead of worrying about subscription costs.\n\r\nWhat else we offer:\n\r\n\n\r\nMonthly salary starting at $500/month for promising candidates, scaling up to $3,500/month for top performers — we pay for results and commitment, not just hours\n\r\nSalary paid consistently (weekly during your first 2 months, then bi-monthly)\n\r\n13th month bonus in December\n\r\nAll AI tool subscriptions and software covered by us\n\r\nTraining on our specific workflows and client standards\n\r\nReal career growth — we promote from within and reward strong performers with raises and leadership opportunities\n\r\nPayment via Wise, PayPal, or your preferred method\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\nYour day-to-day work will include:\n\r\n\n\r\nCreating AI-generated video content using multiple platforms — selecting the right tool for each creative challenge\n\r\nBuilding and animating realistic digital avatars with accurate lip sync, natural facial expressions, and believable body language\n\r\nEditing and polishing final videos in Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, or DaVinci Resolve — including transitions, motion graphics, captions, color correction, and audio mixing\n\r\nTranslating scripts and client briefs into visual content across corporate, cinematic, and commercial styles\n\r\nQuality-checking every deliverable for consistency in character appearance, lighting, pacing, and overall professional standard\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We're Looking For\n\r\nWe need someone who treats AI as a creative tool, not a shortcut. The right person has three qualities:\n\r\n1. High standards for quality. You notice artifacts, background warping, unnatural blinking, and lip sync issues before anyone else. Color correction and lighting continuity are part of your process from the start — not finishing touches.\n\r\n2. Understanding of AI video tools. You don't need to own subscriptions to every platform, but you should understand what different AI video tools can do and how they compare. If you've used free tiers, watched breakdowns, experimented during trials, or studied these tools closely — that counts. We will give you full access once you're on the team.\n\r\n3. Strong post-production skills. Creating the AI clip is only half the job. Editing, pacing, sound design, compositing, and storytelling are the other half. You should be comfortable and confident in Premiere Pro, After Effects, or DaVinci Resolve.\n\r\n\n\r\nTechnical Requirements\n\r\n\n\r\nHands-on experience or demonstrated knowledge of 2 or more AI video platforms (HeyGen, Kling, VEO, Runway, Midjourney, Pika, Sora, etc.)\n\r\nAdvanced proficiency in Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects (or DaVinci Resolve)\n\r\nPortfolio showing strong visual storytelling, pacing, and compositional sense\n\r\nClear English communication — you'll interpret creative briefs and collaborate directly with our team\n\r\nReliable internet connection and a computer capable of running video editing software smoothly\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply — Please Read Carefully\n\r\nWe review every application personally. To help us find the right person, please include the following in your application:\n\r\n1. Show us your work. Share 2-3 video samples. We are looking for:\n\r\n\n\r\nAI-generated video work if you have it (even free-tier or watermarked samples are fine — we understand tool access is limited)\n\r\nPolished post-production work (editing, color, motion graphics, sound design)\n\r\nAvatar-focused or character-driven examples will put you at the top of the list\n\r\nIf you don't have AI video samples, show us your strongest traditional editing work AND explain which AI video tools you've studied or experimented with and what you know about their strengths and limitations\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Tell us why this role fits you. In a few sentences (not a copy-paste cover letter), explain what about this position matches where you are in your career and why you're looking for something permanent.\n\r\n3. Include the word \"Storyboard\" at the beginning of your application so we know you read the full post.\n\r\nImportant: Applications without any work samples will not be reviewed. You don't need a perfect portfolio — but we need to see evidence of your skills and your eye for quality.                ",

    "description": "\n                    About Castle Hill Investments\n\r\n\n\r\nCastle Hill Investments acquires commercial real estate through online auctions. We provide liquidity in an inefficient market where some sellers need to dispose of property quickly. The barriers (cash required, 30-day close, limited info, no contingencies) keep most buyers away — that's our edge.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're looking for a deal hunter, not a button-pusher.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a typical underwriting position. We don't need someone to passively monitor auction sites and hand us spreadsheets. We need someone who will hunt for deals, form opinions, and pitch them to us — the way a scout would bring opportunities to an investor.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll be the first set of eyes on every potential acquisition. Your job is to find the deals worth our attention, explain why they're interesting, and flag the risks. You'll participate in regular video calls with our leadership team where you present deals and debate strategy. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo be clear: you won't be originating deals — 100% of deal flow comes from published auction listings on sites like Ten-X, Crexi, and RIMarketplace. Your job is to evaluate what's out there, identify the opportunities worth pursuing, and pitch them to leadership.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're waiting to be told what to do, this isn't for you. If you want to be in the room where decisions happen, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Do:\n\r\n-Hunt daily: Monitor Ten-X/LoopNet, Crexi, and RIMarketplace for deals in our target range ($500K–$2M)\n\r\n-Form opinions: Don't just flag deals — tell us why you like them. \"This looks like a value-add play because...\" or \"I'd pass on this because...\"\n\r\n-Pitch on calls: 3-5x/week video calls where you present new deals, share deeper analysis on yesterday's MAYBEs, and discuss next steps\n\r\n-Build conviction: When you find a deal you believe in, make the case. Push back if we're skeptical. We want your perspective.\n\r\n-Build strategy: You’ll develop how this new business operates alongside leadership.\n\r\n-Develop into leadership: This role has a clear path to becoming our Head of Acquisitions as the business scales\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are:\n\r\n-Entrepreneurial mindset — You see deals the way an investor does, not the way an employee does\n\r\n-Opinionated and confident — You'll tell us what you think, not just what we want to hear\n\r\n-Strong communicator — You can explain a deal clearly on a video call and in writing\n\r\n-Commercially aware — You understand what makes a property attractive (location, cash flow potential, value-add angles) even with limited information\n\r\n-Self-directed — You'll figure out what needs to happen without waiting for instructions\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\n-Experience in commercial real estate — underwriting, brokerage, acquisitions, or similar\n\r\n-Excellent spoken and written English (you'll be pitching on video calls)\n\r\n-Comfortable with ambiguity and incomplete information\n\r\n-Available for Mon/Wed/Fri morning calls (~10-11am CST)\n\r\n-Full-time availability (40 hrs/week), M-F 10am–7pm CST\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation:\n\r\n-Base: $1,300–$1,600/month USD (based on experience and interview performance)\n\r\n-Performance bonus: Deal identification bonuses when your recommendations convert to acquisitions\n\r\n-13th month pay, PH holidays, PTO\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nSend an\n to \n with:\n\r\n1. Your resume\n\r\n2. A 2-minute video introducing yourself. Tell us:\n\r\na. Why you want this role (specifically, not generically)\n\r\nb. A deal or investment you recommended to someone in the past — what was it, why did you like it, what happened?\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're not looking for polish.

This role plays a key part in maintaining service levels, optimizing resource utilization, and supporting operational decision-making through accurate forecasting, scheduling insights, and performance analysis. If you enjoy working with data, anticipating business needs, and turning numbers into actionable plans, this is a great opportunity to make a meaningful impact within a fast-paced, remote-first environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Be Doing\n\r\nAs a Capacity Planner, you will own the full workforce management cycle: forecasting demand, translating it into staffing and schedules, and then managing the day in real time to protect service levels and labor efficiency. Your role goes beyond “making schedules”; it includes demand forecasting, resource scheduling, time management, day-of queue management, time-off handling, and scenario planning.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Core Responsibilities\n\r\n**Forecasting and Capacity Planning\n\r\n- Build short-term and long-range forecasts (typically interval-based) for workload/volume and handle time, then translate forecasts into headcount and capacity requirements.\n\r\n- Maintain forecast inputs that materially affect staffing: AHT trends, shrinkage assumptions (planned and unplanned), occupancy targets, and seasonality/event effects.\n\r\n- Track forecast vs actual, quantify forecast accuracy, and perform root-cause analysis when service outcomes miss targets.\n\r\n- Partner with Operations and cross-functional teams to incorporate “external factors” into forecasts (promos, outages, policy changes, new launches, routing changes).\n\r\n\n\r\n**Staffing Models and Scheduling\n\r\n- Convert demand into staffing requirements using contact center staffing principles/models (for example, Erlang-based approaches are commonly used to connect volume, handle time, response time, and required staffing).\n\r\n- Generate schedules that align tea\nmber coverage to demand, including work rules, shift types, training/offline activities, and time-off approvals aligned to staffing impact.\n\r\n- Maintain clean headcount rosters and schedule inputs (skills, queues, sites, credentials) to keep forecasts and schedules reliable.\n\r\n- Create multiple staffing scenarios when inputs change (hiring delays, attrition, shrinkage shifts, new SLAs), and communicate tradeoffs and risks clearly.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Intraday Management and Real-Time Control\n\r\n- Monitor the current day’s volumes and trends, then adjust schedules accordingly (OT, VTO, skill rebalances, moving offline work, rescheduling shrinkage events).\n\r\n- Actively manage schedule adherence using real-time adherence concepts (scheduled activity vs actual activity) and coordinate with Ops to correct deviations that threaten SLAs.\n\r\n- Own an escalation plan and decision thresholds for intraday actions (what triggers action, what actions are allowed, how changes are communicated).\n\r\n\n\r\n**Reporting, Analytics, and Decision Support\n\r\n- Produce daily/weekly/monthly performance reporting that ties forecast, coverage, adherence, and service results together for leaders.\n\r\n- Build and improve reporting templates and dashboards that make trends and risk visible (forecast vs actual, interval performance, attendance/tardiness, overtime drivers).\n\r\n\n\r\n**Stakeholder Partnership and Planning Culture\n\r\n- Run regular and ad hoc reviews with Operations and other stakeholders to review staffing models, risks, and mitigation plans.\n\r\n- Balance business needs with the reality that schedules affect humans (practical, sustainable scheduling and communication).\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Bring to the Table\n\r\n- Proven experience in workforce management and capacity planning within a BPO, e-commerce, or service-driven environment.\n\r\n- Strong working knowledge of forecasting methodologies, scheduling principles, and intraday management.\n\r\n- Proficiency in WFM tools (e.g., Verint, Aspect, or similar) and advanced Excel or Google Sheets skills.\n\r\n- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to interpret complex data sets.\n\r\n- Clear and effective communication skills, with the ability to collaborate cross-functionally.\n\r\n- Ability to manage multiple priorities, meet tight deadlines, and stay composed in fast-paced, real-time environments.\n\r\n- Reliable high-speed internet connection and a dependable computer setup for remote work\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Core Competencies\n\r\n- Analytical Thinking: Uses data-driven insights to forecast demand, identify risks, and support workforce decisions.\n\r\n- Planning & Organization: Translates complex demand signals into structured staffing plans and executable schedules.\n\r\n- Operational Judgment: Makes sound, timely decisions during intraday fluctuations and SLA risk scenarios.\n\r\n- Attention to Detail: Ensures forecasts, schedules, rosters, and reports are accurate and reliable.\n\r\n- Proactivity: Anticipates capacity gaps and acts early to mitigate service and staffing risks.\n\r\n- Adaptability: Adjusts forecasts and plans quickly in response to changing volumes, priorities, or business needs.\n\r\n- Communication: Clearly explains workforce insights, tradeoffs, and recommendations to Operations and stakeholders.\n\r\n- Calm Under Pressure: Maintains focus and decision-making discipline during peak volume periods and real-time escalations.\n\r\n- Accountability: Takes ownership of workforce outcomes and follows through on commitments.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat’s In It For You?\n\r\n- 100% Remote Work – Work from anywhere in the Philippines\n\r\n- Leadership Growth – Opportunity to scale your impact and grow within Workforce Operations\n\r\n- Competitive Pay – $9/hr + benefits as an independent contractor\n\r\n- Supportive Culture – Collaborate

career path\n\r\n\n\r\nReady to Plan with Precision?\n\r\nIf you’re passionate about forecasting, data-driven decision-making, and turning insights into smart staffing strategies, we’d love to meet you!

Our customers are attorneys and legal staff who use our product daily. We're growing and need a dedicated support person to help our customers get the most out of our software.\n\r\n\n\r\n What You'll Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\n Customer Support (Primary)\n\r\n * Monitor and respond to incoming support\ns and chat messages during business hours\n\r\n * Troubleshoot customer issues — most are configuration, setup, or \"how do I do this?\" questions\n\r\n * Conduct video calls with screen sharing to walk customers through solutions\n\r\n * Log every support interaction into our ticketing system with clear notes on the issue, steps taken, and resolution\n\r\n * Escalate complex or technical issues to our development team with well-documented details\n\r\n * Follow up with customers to confirm issues are resolved\n\r\n\n\r\n Onboarding Assistance\n\r\n * Help new law firm customers get set up and configured\n\r\n * Walk users through initial setup via\n, chat, or video call\n\r\n * Create and update simple how-to guides or FAQs based on recurring questions\n\r\n\n\r\n Quality & Improvement\n\r\n * Track common issues and suggest improvements to documentation or product\n\r\n * Flag patterns — if multiple customers hit the same problem, let us know\n\r\n * Help us build out our knowledge base over time\n\r\n\n\r\n Who We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n Must-haves:\n\r\n * Completely fluent English — spoken and written. You'll be on video calls with U.S. attorneys and their staff. Your English must be polished and professional in both writing and live conversation.\n\r\n * Available 8:00 AM – 4:00 PM Pacific Time. This is not full-time active work — you need to be responsive and on-call during this window to handle support requests as they come in. Some days will be busy, others quiet. We understand this is late evening / overnight in the Philippines — this must genuinely work for your schedule long-term.\n\r\n * Patient and empathetic. Our customers are busy professionals who are not always tech-savvy. You need to explain things clearly without talking down to anyone.\n\r\n * Strong written communication. Most support is via\n and chat. Your messages need to be clear, professional, and helpful — not robotic or overly scripted. We require you use a good LLM like Claude 4.6 to draft responses.  We will pay the $20/month for Claude.\n\r\n * Comfortable on video calls. You'll occasionally share screens and walk customers through steps live. A professional appearance, clear audio, and good camera setup are expected.\n\r\n * Reliable internet and quiet workspace — non-negotiable for calls and consistent availability.\n\r\n * Willing to work with AI / LLMs — we use AI tools internally and expect you to as well.\n\r\n\n\r\n Strong pluses:\n\r\n * Prior experience in SaaS or software technical support\n\r\n * Experience supporting U.S.-based customers\n\r\n * Familiarity with ticketing systems (Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom, HubSpot, or similar)\n\r\n * Familiarity with the legal industry or legal software (Clio and MyCase)\n\r\n * Quick learner — comfortable picking up new software without extensive hand-holding\n\r\n * Experience creating help documentation or knowledge base articles\n\r\n\n\r\n What We Provide\n\r\n * Full training on our product — you don't need to know it coming in, but you need to learn it quickly\n\r\n * Training on our support ticketing system and processes\n\r\n * Direct access to our development team for escalations\n\r\n * A supportive, small-team environment where your input matters\n\r\n\n\r\n Compensation\n\r\n * Base rate: $10–$13/hour USD, depending on experience\n\r\n * Annual review: We revisit the rate annually as the company grows\n\r\n * Stability: We're looking for a long-term tea\nmber, not a short-term contractor\n\r\n * Growth potential: As we grow, this role can expand in scope and compensation\n\r\n\n\r\n How to Apply\n\r\n Please send:\n\r\n 1. A short introduction about yourself and why this role interests you\n\r\n 2. Your experience with technical support, customer service, or SaaS products\n\r\n 3. Your English proficiency level and any certifications (IELTS, TOEFL, etc.), if available\n\r\n 4. Confirm that you can be consistently available 8:00 AM – 4:00 PM Pacific Time\n\r\n 5. Your expected hourly rate\n\r\n 6. A brief sample: Write 3–4 sentences as if you were responding to this customer\n: \"Hi, I just signed up for your software, but I can't figure out how to connect it to my Clio account. Can someone help?\"  (Use Claude to draft the response).\n\r\n\n\r\nWe respond to every qualified application within 1 business day.                ",

    "description": "\n                    About Us:\n\r\nWe're a fast-growing US-based DTC brand in the health and wellness space. We make a high-protein dessert mix that's easy to make at home, tastes amazing, and has great macros with zero added sugar. People love it. Nearly 7,000 customers in under 9 months and growing every week.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're building our blog from scratch and need a solid writer to help us own organic search for topics like protein desserts, healthy recipes, and nutrition. You'd be getting in early at a brand that's taking off. You'll work directly with me (the founder), not a manager or agency.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo get a feel for what we're going for, check out Vital Proteins' blog: \n -- We want that kind of quality, but for our brand and audience.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing:\n\r\n\n\r\nBlog Content\n\r\n- Writing and publishing articles in Shopify (5-8 per week at first while we build out the blog, then 2-3 per week ongoing)\n\r\n- Two types of content: recipe posts (protein dessert recipes with instructions, ingredients, nutritional info) and health/wellness articles (protein, nutrition, healthy eating, fitness-friendly)\n\r\n- Helping shape the blog structure, categories, and content direction from the ground up\n\r\n\n\r\nSEO & GEO\n\r\n- This is the most important part of the role.\n\r\n- Keyword research and topic planning based on what people are actually searching for\n\r\n- Writing content that ranks in Google AND shows up in AI-generated answers (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity). This is called Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) and it's a big deal for us.\n\r\n- On-page SEO: internal linking, meta descriptions, heading structure, search intent, E-E-A-T principles\n\r\n- If SEO and GEO aren't your thing, this role probably isn't the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n Content\n\r\n- Helping put together a weekly recipe\n and occasional newsletter content (we use Klaviyo)\n\r\n- Repurposing blog content into\n-friendly format\n\r\n\n\r\nImages\n\r\n- Sourcing and formatting images for posts (we have stock photo access, and experience with AI image generation tools is a plus)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhere This Role Could Grow:\n\r\nAs we scale, there's room to take on social media content, landing page copy, and broader marketing work. Not required now, but if you have that experience, great.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are:\n\r\n- Native-level English writing skills (not just conversational)\n\r\n- Real SEO experience. You've done keyword research, you understand search intent, you've written content that ranks. Not a beginner.\n\r\n- Familiar with GEO or ready to learn it quickly\n\r\n- Comfortable publishing in Shopify\n\r\n- Experience writing about health, food, or nutrition is a big plus\n\r\n- Self-starter. You can take a topic and run with it.\n\r\n- You use AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to work smarter. We're all for it. We just care that the final product sounds human and is actually useful, not generic AI slop.\n\r\n- Reliable. You show up, you hit deadlines, and if something comes up, you tell me. Simple as that.\n\r\n\n\r\nPay & Details:\n\r\n\n\r\n- $7-$9/hour depending on experience\n\r\n- 20-30 hours/week to start, room to grow\n\r\n- Long-term role. We want someone who grows with us.\n\r\n- You work directly with the founder\n\r\n- Real opportunity to grow into a bigger content marketing role\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\n- Please include the word \"chocolate\" in the first line of your application so I know you read this entire post. :)\n\r\n\n\r\nThen please tell me:\n\r\n1) Quick intro and your content/SEO experience\n\r\n2) Links to 5-10 writing samples (health, food, or lifestyle preferred. If anything ranks well, mention it.)\n\r\n3) Your rate expectation\n\r\n4) Availability (hours per day, timezone)\n\r\n5) What AI tools do you use and how?\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you!                ",

All companies/accounts are part of the Outdoor industry.\n\r\n\n\r\nExecution & Iteration: Build, launch, and relentlessly optimize Search, Display, and Video campaigns based on internal strategy briefs.\n\r\n\n\r\nBudget Stewardship: Manage client budgets with extreme precision, ensuring we hit spend targets while maximizing ROI.\n\r\n\n\r\nCritical Problem Solving: Don't just follow a checklist. Analyze \"why\" an account is fluctuating and propose technical solutions to fix it.\n\r\n\n\r\nInternal Collaboration: Participate in weekly internal strategy syncs with OxBow managers to report on performance and plan upcoming technical moves.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role is Different:\n\r\nDeep Work Environment: No client interruptions. No frantic \"where is my ad?\" phone calls. You are here to focus on the numbers and the creative.\n\r\n\n\r\nCollaborative Support: Our Account Managers handle the \"people stuff\" and provide you with clear tasks and information from the client.\n\r\n\n\r\nTraining & Onboarding: We provide a 1-month paid training period to get you up to speed on the \"OxBow Way\" of managing accounts.\n\r\n\n\r\nCritical Thinker: You look at a high CPC and don't just see a number; you see a landing page friction point or a keyword match-type error.\n\r\n\n\r\nBudget Conscious: You treat the client's money as your own—maximizing efficiency and preventing waste.\n\r\n\n\r\nTeam-First Communicator: Ability to explain technical ad concepts clearly to internal tea\nmbers during weekly calls.\n\r\n\n\r\nAccountability: You are self-motivated and take pride in \"owning\" the performance of your assigned cohort of accounts.
