    "description": "\n                    About Us\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a fast-growing B2B lead generation agency that helps professional service firms (insurance agencies, law firms, IT companies, financial advisors, and property maintenance companies) fill their pipeline with qualified prospects. We send high-volume, hyper-personalized cold\n campaigns across multiple industries and we need someone who can own the entire\n operation from list building to lead delivery.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a \"send 500\ns a week\" role. We operate at scale — tens of thousands of\ns per day across hundreds of inboxes. If you have never managed infrastructure at this level, this role is not for you. If you have, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Do Every Day\n\r\n\n\r\nCampaign Operations (60% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will manage the end-to-end cold\n process for multiple clients across different industries. This includes building targeted lead lists using B2B data platforms, writing and loading\n sequences into the sending platform, scheduling campaigns across rotating inboxes, and monitoring deliverability metrics (open rates, bounce rates, spam complaints) daily. You will manage 100+ sending inboxes and ensure every one stays healthy.\n\r\n\n\r\nDeliverability Management (20% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will own inbox warming, domain health, and sender reputation across all accounts. This means monitoring inbox placement rates, rotating underperforming domains, managing DNS authentication records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), and proactively pausing or replacing inboxes before they damage the overall sending reputation. You will run deliverability tests weekly and report results.\n\r\n\n\r\nLead Processing & Delivery (10% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen prospects reply, you will categorize responses (interested, maybe later, not interested, out of office, wrong person) and deliver qualified warm leads to clients via Google Sheets or CRM. Speed matters — warm leads must be delivered within 2 hours of reply during business hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nReporting & Optimization (10% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will maintain a weekly performance dashboard for each client showing\ns sent, open rates, reply rates, positive reply rates, and meetings booked. You will run A/B tests on subject lines, opening lines, and CTAs, and make data-driven recommendations to improve performance.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Experience & Skills\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have hands-on experience with at least two of the following cold\n sending platforms: Smartlead, Instantly, Lemlist, Woodpecker, or Mailshake. You should be comfortable managing campaigns with 50+ active sending accounts simultaneously.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must understand\n deliverability at a technical level — not just \"warm up your inbox\" but the actual mechanics of SPF/DKIM/DMARC configuration, inbox rotation strategies, and how to diagnose and fix deliverability drops.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have experience with B2B lead data platforms for building targeted prospect lists. You should know how to filter by industry, company size, job title, geography, and other criteria to build high-quality lists that match a client's ideal customer profile.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be proficient in Google Sheets (pivot tables, VLOOKUP, data cleanup formulas) since this is how we track leads and report to clients.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong written English is required. You will be writing and editing\n copy that goes to American business owners — it must sound natural, not templated.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPreferred (Bonus) Skills\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with Clay or similar data enrichment tools for adding personalization layers to lead lists. Experience using AI (ChatGPT, Claude) to generate personalized\n icebreakers at scale. Familiarity with Google Workspace admin for managing multiple inboxes. Experience with Zapier, Make, or n8n for workflow automation between platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application, answer these four questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.\n\r\nWhat is the largest number of sending inboxes you have managed at one time, and what sending platform were you using?\n\r\n\n\r\n2.\n\r\nDescribe a time when your\n deliverability dropped significantly. What caused it and how did you fix it?\n\r\n\n\r\n3.\n\r\nWhat is your process for building a lead list of 10,000 business owners in a specific industry and geography?\n\r\n\n\r\n4.\n\r\nShow me an example of a hyper-personalized cold\n you wrote (or generated with AI). What data points did you use to personalize it, and where did you get that data? If you cannot share a real example, write one right now for a fictional insurance agency owner named Mike Thompson who runs a 12-person agency in Dallas, TX.\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a generic cover letter. Applications that do not answer these four questions will not be reviewed.                ",

We work with law firms, insurance agencies, financial advisors, IT companies, and other professional service businesses. Our edge is that we do not just offer one service. We look at a business, identify every process that is repetitive, manual, or slow, and we build AI-powered systems that handle it automatically.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone who thinks in systems. Someone who hears \"I spend 3 hours a day doing X\" and immediately knows how to make it happen in 3 minutes. Someone who is obsessed with connecting tools, building workflows, and using AI to eliminate busywork across every part of a business.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a \"set up a Zapier zap\" role. We build complex, multi-step, AI-driven automation systems that run entire business operations. If you have only built simple two-step automations, this role is not for you. If you have built systems that made people ask \"how the hell does this work?\" — keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Do\n\r\n\n\r\nYour job is to look at any business process — ours or our clients' — and figure out how to automate it. The scope is broad on purpose. Here are the categories of work you will own:\n\r\n\n\r\nAI-Powered Business Automation (40% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will design and build automated systems that replace manual work across every part of our business and our clients' businesses. This includes but is not limited to:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nLead generation pipelines: Automated scraping, enrichment, AI-powered hyper-personalization, and campaign deployment — so leads flow in without anyone touching a spreadsheet.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nClient onboarding workflows: When a new client signs up, automated sequences that collect their information, set up their accounts, send welcome materials, and schedule kickoff calls — without a human doing any of it.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nCRM and pipeline management: Automated lead categorization, follow-up scheduling, deal stage updates, and alert systems that notify the right person at the right time.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nDocument and proposal generation: AI-powered systems that take client data and automatically generate custom proposals, reports, or deliverables.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nInternal operations: Automated reporting dashboards, task assignment systems, performance tracking, and anything else that currently requires someone to manually update a spreadsheet or send a Slack message.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will use whatever tools the job requires — Make (Integromat), n8n, Zapier, custom Python/Node.js scripts, Google Apps Script, or direct API integrations. You pick the right tool for the job.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Content & Social Media Automation (25% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will build and manage automated content creation and distribution systems. This includes:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nAutomated video generation: Using platforms like HeyGen, Synthesia, Pictory, or similar tools to generate AI avatar videos, repurpose long-form content into short clips, and produce video content at scale without a production team.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nSocial media scheduling and posting: Building automated pipelines that generate social media content using AI (captions, hashtags, image selection), schedule posts across multiple platforms, and adapt content format for each channel (LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok,\n, X).\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nContent repurposing engines: Systems that take one piece of content (a blog post, a podcast episode, a video) and automatically break it into 10-20 pieces of social content — different formats, different platforms, different angles — all generated and scheduled without manual work.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nAI-powered copywriting pipelines: Automated systems that generate blog posts,\n newsletters, ad copy, and landing page content using AI, with human review checkpoints built into the workflow.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou should be familiar with tools like Buffer, Hootsuite, or Later for scheduling, and AI video tools like HeyGen, Pictory, or Opus Clip for automated video creation. If you have experience with Canva API or similar design automation, even better.\n\r\n\n\r\nClient-Facing Automation Solutions (20% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is where it gets interesting. We sell automation services to our clients — law firms, insurance agencies, financial advisors, and other businesses. You will build custom automation solutions that we deliver as a product. Examples:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nA law firm that manually tracks case deadlines ? you build an automated system that pulls court dates, sends reminders to attorneys, and escalates overdue items.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nAn insurance agency that manually sends renewal reminders ? you build an automated pipeline that identifies upcoming renewals, generates personalized outreach, and tracks responses.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nA financial advisor that manually creates quarterly reports ? you build a system that pulls portfolio data, generates AI-written commentary, and produces branded PDF reports automatically.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nA property management company that manually coordinates maintenance requests ? you build a system that receives requests, categorizes urgency with AI, dispatches vendors, and sends status updates to tenants.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe point is: you will constantly be solving new problems for new types of businesses. You need to be the kind of person who gets excited when someone describes a manual process, because you already see how to automate it.\n\r\n\n\r\nProactive Problem-Solving & Innovation (10% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is the most important part of the job description. We want you to constantly ask us what we are doing manually and tell us how to automate it. If you see us doing something by hand, we expect you to come to us and say \"I can build something that does that in 10 seconds.\" We want you to be so good at this that we start to wonder what we even do all day because you have automated everything.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will also stay current on new AI tools, automation platforms, and integration possibilities. When a new tool launches that could save us time or money, you bring it to us. When a client mentions a pain point in a call, you are already thinking about the workflow that solves it.\n\r\n\n\r\nDocumentation & Maintenance (5% of your time — but always on)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will document every automation you build — what it does, how it works, what triggers it, and how to troubleshoot it. When something breaks, you fix it fast. You will also build monitoring systems that alert you before things break.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Experience & Skills\n\r\n\n\r\nAdvanced automation platform experience is non-negotiable. You must have proven experience building complex, multi-step automations using at least two of the following: Make (Integromat), n8n, Zapier, or custom Python/Node.js scripts with API integrations. \"Complex\" means 10+ steps, multiple conditional branches, error handling, and integrations with 3+ different platforms in a single workflow. You should be able to show examples.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be an API expert. Reading documentation, authenticating (OAuth, API keys, Bearer tokens), making requests, parsing JSON responses, handling pagination, managing rate limits, and building retry logic. If a tool has an API, you should be able to connect it to anything else within hours, not days.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have deep experience with AI/LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, or similar). This goes beyond basic prompting. You should understand structured output formats (JSON mode), function calling, prompt chaining, context window management, and how to build quality control layers that catch bad AI output before it reaches a customer. You will use AI as a core component in almost every automation you build.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have experience with AI-powered content and video generation tools. This includes platforms like HeyGen, Synthesia, Pictory, Opus Clip, or similar for automated video creation, and experience integrating these tools into larger automated workflows via their APIs.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be proficient with Google Workspace automation — Google Sheets, Google Apps Script, Google Drive API, and Gmail API. A huge amount of our work flows through Google products, and you need to be able to build sophisticated automations within that ecosystem.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must think like a consultant, not just a technician. When someone describes a business problem, you should immediately start mapping out the automation architecture in your head. You do not wait to be told what to build — you identify opportunities and propose solutions.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong English communication is required. You will be on calls with clients explaining what you built and why. You need to be able to translate technical automation concepts into simple business language.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPreferred (Bonus) Skills\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with cold\n platforms (Smartlead, Instantly) and their APIs. Experience with CRM platforms (HubSpot, GoHighLevel, Salesforce) and their automation capabilities. Experience with webhook-based event processing and real-time data pipelines. Familiarity with cloud functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) or similar serverless environments. Experience building Slack/\n bots or notification systems. Experience with web scraping (Apify, Puppeteer, BeautifulSoup). Experience with database design and management (Airtable, Supabase, Firebase, or SQL). Experience building client-facing dashboards or reporting tools. Knowledge of social media APIs (Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok, X).\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application, answer these five questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.\n\r\nDescribe the most complex automation system you have ever built. What business problem did it solve, what tools did it connect, how many steps were involved, and what was the measurable impact (time saved, revenue generated, errors eliminated)?\n\r\n\n\r\n2.\n\r\nA law firm tells you they spend 5 hours per week manually sending follow-up\ns to leads who filled out a contact form on their website. Walk me through exactly how you would automate this end-to-end, including which tools you would use and why.\n\r\n\n\r\n3.\n\r\nHave you built any automated content creation or video generation systems? If yes, describe what you built, what AI tools you used, and how the content was distributed. If no, describe how you would approach building an automated system that takes one 30-minute podcast episode and turns it into 15 social media posts across 4 platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\n4.\n\r\nShow me a Loom video (preferred) or detailed screenshot walkthrough of an automation you built that is currently running in production. Walk me through the logic, the tools, and how you handle errors.\n\r\n\n\r\n5.\n\r\nWhat is the most creative automation you have ever built or seen? Something that made you think \"that is genius.\" Describe it and explain why it impressed you.\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a generic cover letter. Applications that do not answer all five questions will not be reviewed.                ",

Your Key Responsibilities\n\r\nThe Pulse (KPIs): Own the weekly KPI dashboard (Revenue, Payroll %, Provider Productivity, Collections, and AR).\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Books: Full-cycle QuickBooks Online management, including meticulous bank reconciliation and expense categorization.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe People: Audit payroll, analyze labor costs, and ensure \"hours worked vs. revenue generated\" stays in balance.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Flow: Manage accounts payable (bills) and ensure financial data integrity across multiple clinic locations.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Future: Assist the CEO and fractional CFO with budgeting and forecasting models.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Standard: Help design and document Financial SOPs so our operations are scalable and \"bulletproof.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n????

You can explain why a number is down, not just that it is down.\n\r\n\n\r\nProactive Nature: You don't wait for the CEO to ask for a report; you have it ready before they think of it.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Ideal Candidate Profile\n\r\nYou are calm under pressure and comfortable with a fast-moving CEO.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou value discretion—handling sensitive psychiatric practice data and payroll requires a high level of integrity.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou prefer \"building the system\" over just \"following a list.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n???? How to Apply (Strict Requirements)\n\r\nFailure to follow these steps will result in your application being ignored.\n\r\n\n\r\nResume: Updated PDF version.\n\r\n\n\r\nLoom Video (2–3 mins): Briefly explain your experience managing US healthcare financials, your proficiency with QuickBooks, and one specific time you found a cost-saving or error that others missed.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Proof: Provide a screenshot or link to a KPI Dashboard you have built (please redact/blur any sensitive previous client info).

We need more than basic reels. We need someone who can produce clear, powerful, and trustworthy content that speaks to seniors, adult children, caregivers, and health care partners.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n What You Must Do Before Applying\n\r\n\n\r\nApplicants will only be considered after completing all steps.\n\r\n\n\r\n1.

Like the page so we can add you as a content manager.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n Key Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\n* Create a complete content strategy for\n, Instagram, and TikTok\n\r\n* Produce educational content about Alzheimer’s, dementia, and senior care\n\r\n* Create reels explaining the new Medicare GUIDE Program in clear and simple language\n\r\n* Post weekly service highlights for Houston and Tyler, Texas\n\r\n* Create caregiver-focused posts that offer support, tips, and encouragement\n\r\n* Share information about respite care, supervised visits, companionship, housekeeping, meal support, mobility help, and safety monitoring\n\r\n* Build campaigns that target adult children caring for aging parents\n\r\n* Design high-quality graphics that match the 21st Century Quality Home Care brand\n\r\n* Write captions that encourage families to reach out for help\n\r\n* Increase page engagement, reach, and community awareness\n\r\n* Track analytics and adjust strategy based on results\n\r\nMost important Long term Care insurance pays for in home non medical care and we must to reach on the different whole life insurance plans. See below. \n\r\nHere are a few real-world examples to present to clients:\n\r\n\n\r\nTexas Life Insurance Company: Their product (SBBC-Overview) includes an Accelerated Death Benefit Rider for terminal illness for no added premium. But note: this is for terminal illness, and may not cover non-medical home care or custodial care in the way your clients need. \n\r\nTexas Life\n\r\n\n\r\nTexas Republic Life Insurance Company (“TrueFlex” product): Includes a Chronic Care Rider: you can accelerate 45 % of death benefit if unable to perform 2 of the 6 ADLs or have severe cognitive impairment; paid out over 24-months. This is closer to what you might need (custodial/home care) though you’d check if “non-medical home care services” are eligible. \n\r\nTexas Republic Life Insurance Company\n\r\n\n\r\nGeneric “life insurance with LTC rider” info: For example, the article from Progressive Casualty Insurance Company describes how an LTC rider is added to whole/universal life policy and allows early life insurance death benefits for long-term care expenses such as home health care worker. \n\r\nProgressive\n\r\n\n\r\n???? How to Position This for Your Agency\n\r\n\n\r\nSince your agency provides non-medical home care services, here are ways you can make this relevant for your clients and your business:\n\r\n\n\r\nClient education: Create a one-pager or workshop for your clients (or prospects) explaining: “How your life insurance policy could be used to fund home care,” outlining what to ask their insurance agent (rider type, ADL triggers, home care coverage, assignment options).\n\r\n\n\r\nReferral network: Consider partnering or building relationships with local life-insurance brokers/agents in Texas who specialise in “living-benefits” riders or life insurance + LTC hybrid products. They can refer clients who have policies that might match your services.\n\r\n\n\r\nIntake workflow: When onboarding a client who says they’ll use a life-insurance rider, include in your intake: copy of the policy benefit summary, rider details, underwriting criteria (ADLs, etc), assignment letter or provider payment options, verification of your agency as eligible provider under that policy (if needed).\n\r\n\n\r\nRepresentation & documentation: Ensure that your service agreement with the client explicitly describes the non-medical home care services you provide; keep detailed care logs, ADL progress/decline if applicable, so the insurer’s trigger conditions (e.g., inability to perform 2 ADLs) are documented.\n\r\n\n\r\nClarify expectations: Because many policies may only cover skilled care vs. pure non-medical companion/homemaker care, ensure the client understands potential gaps and payment responsibilities if the policy doesn’t cover exactly what your services include.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Are Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n* Someone who can create content that builds trust and authority\n\r\n* Experience in caregiving, health care, senior care, dementia care,  and Veterans benefits for cover the cost of non medical home care\n\r\n* Strong skills in short-form video editing, social storytelling, health education, and community engagement\n\r\n* Ability to turn complex information into simple, family-friendly content\n\r\n* Someone who understands how to create reels that get shared\n\r\n* A creative thinker who understands the emotional side of caregiving\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must know how to produce content that speaks to:\n\r\n\n\r\n* Family caregivers\n\r\n* Spouses caring for loved ones\n\r\n* Adult children overwhelmed by caregiving demands\n\r\n* Seniors who want to age safely at home\n\r\n* People worried about memory loss, confusion, or dementia progression\n\r\n\n\r\nWe want someone who can make our content feel real, compassionate, and helpful.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout 21st Century Quality Home Care\n\r\n\n\r\nWe provide:\n\r\n\n\r\n* Non-medical in-home care\n\r\n* Alzheimer’s and dementia support\n\r\n* Respite care\n\r\n* Personal care and bathing assistance\n\r\n* Companionship\n\r\n* Medication reminders\n\r\n* Light housekeeping\n\r\n* Meal preparation\n\r\n* Mobility assistance\n\r\n* Safety and fall prevention\n\r\n* Support for family caregivers\n\r\n* Referrals for the Medicare GUIDE Program (80 hours of support for eligible seniors with traditional Medicare)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe serve seniors who want to remain at home with dignity, safety, and comfort.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n To Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nSend:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.

The app is a multi-tenant safety management platform with a focus on Training/LMS features.\n\r\nWe have an existing codebase and a fresh set of designs. We need you to bridge the gap: implement the new UI designs pixel-perfectly and modify the existing logic to support these changes.\n\r\nThe Tech Stack (Must Have):\n\r\nThis is NOT a beginner role. You must be comfortable with:\n\r\n• Next.js 15 (App Router): We use Server Actions extensively.\n\r\n• TypeScript (Strict): No any types. We prioritize type safety.\n\r\n• Styling: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and Shadcn UI.\n\r\n• Database: PostgreSQL with Kysely query builder (connected via Neon).\n\r\n• State: React Context & React Hook Form (with Zod validation).\n\r\nWhat You Will Do:\n\r\n1. UI/UX Implementation: Take our new designs (Figma/Mockups) and implement them into the existing Next.js application, focusing specifically on the Training & Course Management modules.\n\r\n2. Logic Modification: Refactor existing Server Actions and Components to match the new workflows. You won't be rewriting the whole app, but you will be modifying how Courses, Modules (SCORM/Documents), and User Assignments work.\n\r\n3. Clean Code: We follow a \"Minimal Abstraction\" philosophy. We prefer readable, locatable code over over-engineered patterns. You must be able to read existing code (Middleware, RBAC, etc.) and follow the established patterns.\n\r\n4. Bug Fixing: identifying and fixing UI regressions or logic errors introduced during the redesign.\n\r\nNice to Have (Bonus):\n\r\n• Experience with SCORM or LMS platforms.\n\r\n• Experience with Replicache or Local-First sync strategies.\n\r\n• Experience with file uploads to AWS S3 via presigned URLs.\n\r\nWho You Are:\n\r\n• You pay attention to detail. If the design has 16px padding, you don't make it 20px.\n\r\n• You are comfortable working in a large, existing codebase without breaking unrelated features.\n\r\n• You communicate clearly and flag issues early.\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\nTo ensure you have read this post, please do the following:\n\r\n1. Send a message/email with the subject line: \"Next.js Training Update - [Your Name]\"\n\r\n2. Include a link to your portfolio or GitHub profile.\n\r\n3. Answer this specific question in your cover letter: \"What is your preferred method for handling form validation in Next.js Server Actions?\"\n\r\n4. Tell me your availability (immediate start preferred).\n\r\nNote: Generic copy-paste applications will be ignored. We are looking for a human who knows their code.                ",

The founder is a lawyer and finance guy by training, but you would never guess it. He is approachable, down to earth, and focused on results without the fluff, fake polish, or corporate nonsense.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is about being his right hand. You will protect his time, keep priorities straight, and make sure nothing important is forgotten. You will handle the calendar and inbox, but even more critical, you will manage follow-ups with referral partners, prospective customers, and key relationships so \nntum never dies.\n\r\n\n\r\nA normal day means filtering the inbox and calendar so the noise disappears and the right meetings get scheduled. You will sit in on calls or catch the notes, then turn them into clear follow-ups that live in the CRM and stay alive until complete. You will act as the founder’s second brain when it comes to high-value referral partners, prospects, and customers. You will nudge, remind, and track so relationships don’t fade and opportunities don’t slip. Communication will flow through Slack, where you will capture ideas, tasks, and follow-ups before they vanish.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will keep a close eye on the sales pipeline. We already have systems for the routine stuff, but your focus will be on the high-value opportunities where personal attention is everything. Ahead of meetings, you will pull quick research on people and companies so the founder shows up sharp. You will also work with tea\nmbers, contractors, and vendors to keep important projects moving forward.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is for someone who is proactive, structured, and relentless about follow-through. You thrive in a support role where success means the CEO never has to wonder whether something got done. You are comfortable with modern tools like Google Workspace, Slack, and CRMs, but you do not need to be a tech wizard.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not for someone who waits for instructions or hesitates to speak up. It is not for someone who only wants to be told what to do instead of acting as a true partner.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a full-time remote role. Ideal candidates are based in the Philippines with overlap in Mountain Time. Pay is based on experience, with bonus potential tied to performance. The founder is a foodie and loves cooking meals from scratch, so when you respond, tell us your favorite thing to eat. If you don’t answer that, you will not be considered. You will work directly with the founder as his right hand, making sure that every commitment, relationship, and opportunity gets the follow-through it deserves.                ",
