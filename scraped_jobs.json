    "description": "\n                    About Handshake:\n\r\nHandshake platform is a humanised, AI-powered outreach platform that builds genuine relationships while keeping the efficiency and scale modern businesses need.\n\r\nIt's not another cold outreach tool. This is AI that creates genuine human connections.\n\r\nHandshake helps B2B companies book qualified meetings through psychologically optimised conversations. But here's the difference: our AI doesn't just blast templates. It builds relationships using multiple specialist AI systems that adapt to each conversation.\n\r\nWe're at an exciting stage: Our AI is good, but we want to keep an human expert to ensure it stays great. That's where you come in.\n\r\nCheck out our website: \n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role: Your Mission as the Human Checkpoint\n\r\nYou're the final quality guardian before AI-generated messages reach real prospects.\n\r\nThink of yourself as the bridge between AI precision and human authenticity. You'll review messages, approve what works brilliantly, refine what needs polish, and flag what misses the mark. Your insights help us understand where our AI excels and where it needs course correction.\n\r\nThis isn't just proofreading. You're protecting client reputations, ensuring every message feels genuinely human, and helping businesses book more meetings through conversations that build real relationships.\n\r\nYou'll work across multiple client accounts, each with their own voice, industry, and objectives. Some days you'll approve messages rapidly because the AI nailed it. Other days you'll catch subtle nuances that could make or break a conversation. Both are equally valuable.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Do Daily\n\r\nCore Responsibilities:\n\r\n1. Review and approve AI-generated outreach messages before they're sent\n\r\n2. Edit content to perfectly match each client's brand voice and tone\n\r\n3. Identify when messages need minor tweaks vs. complete rewrites\n\r\n4. Maintain consistency across all client communications\n\r\n5. Flag potential issues with messaging, cultural sensitivity, or appropriateness\n\r\n6. Report patterns and opportunities for AI improvement to the account manager\n\r\n7. Keep detailed quality logs and provide actionable feedback on AI performance\n\r\n8. Balance speed with accuracy (we need quick turnarounds without compromising quality)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're the Perfect Fit If You Have\n\r\nMust-Haves:\n\r\nLinguistic Excellence \n\r\n1. Exceptional English proficiency (native or near-native level)\n\r\n2. Strong grasp of professional business writing styles\n\r\nSharp Eye for Detail\n\r\n1. You catch inconsistencies, and tonal shifts that others miss\n\r\n2. You notice when something is technically correct but doesn't feel quite right\n\r\n3. You're bothered by small errors and driven to fix them\n\r\nAI Literacy\n\r\n1. Experience working with AI tools and understanding their strengths and limitations\n\r\n2. You know AI is brilliant but imperfect, and you're curious about making it better\n\r\n3. Comfortable learning new platforms quickly\n\r\nProfessional Background\n\r\n1. Copy editing, proofreading, or content review experience preferred\n\r\n2. Brand-conscious mindset with ability to adapt tone for different audiences\n\r\n3. Understanding of how messaging impacts business outcomes\n\r\n\n\r\nProactive Ownership & Communication \n\r\n1. You don’t wait for instructions when you see a problem; you flag it and suggest a solution. \n\r\n2. You practice \"high-signal\" communication: keeping your team updated on progress without being asked. \n\r\n3. You are comfortable asking \"Why?\" and \"How can we make this better?\" rather than just following a checklist.\n\r\n\n\r\nSkills That Set You Apart:\n\r\n1. Cultural intelligence, previous experience working with Israeli customers and business leaders\n\r\n2. Quick learner who grasps new industries and terminology rapidly\n\r\n3. Strong time management handling multiple accounts simultaneously\n\r\n4. Proactive communicator comfortable asking questions and raising concerns\n\r\n5. Strategic thinker who understands the psychology behind effective messaging\n\r\n6. Discretion with confidential client information\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have:\n\r\nMarketing, communications | Sales outreach or LinkedIn messaging experience | Familiarity with brand style guides | Experience reviewing AI-generated content\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer:\n\r\nProfessional Growth: Comprehensive training, direct collaboration with our team, regular feedback.\n\r\nFlexibility: Fully remote work from anywhere with reliable internet, and flexible scheduling within APAC business hours. While the role offers flexibility, responsiveness is key. You need to be available to reply promptly when a lead or urgent client message comes in. \n\r\nExperience: Exposure to diverse B2B brands, learn what makes successful outreach work, understand psychological principles behind high-converting conversations\n\r\nCompensation: Competitive part-time hourly rate with potential for increased hours\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\nWe want to see how you think, not just what you've done. Please send us\n\r\n1. Your CV\n\r\nHighlight relevant experience with:\n\r\n- Content review, editing, or proofreading\n\r\n- AI tools or platforms\n\r\n- Cross-cultural communication\n\r\n- Remote work\n\r\n\n\r\n2. We want to see how you think, spot details, and solve real problems you'll face in this role.\n\r\n\n\r\nPart A: AI Detection Skills (\nwords)\n\r\nWhat are 3-4 specific telltale signs that a professional business message was written by AI rather than a human?\n\r\nDon't just say \"it sounds robotic\" be precise. \n\r\nWhat patterns do you notice? What phrases, structures, or quirks give it away? Think about rhythm, word choice, sentence structure, personality (or lack of it), and anything else that makes you think \"hmm, that's not quite human.\"\n\r\nWe want to understand your eye for detail and how you evaluate content quality.\n\r\n\n\r\nPart B: Language Nuance in Context \n\r\nYou're reviewing an outreach message for Israeli C-level audience:\n\r\nAnalyze:\n\r\nAI often writes long, \"flowery\" introductions like: \"I hope this\n finds you well. I was recently looking at your profile and was truly impressed by your accomplishments...\"\n\r\nWhy is the sentence above a \"red flag\" for a busy Israeli CEO? (1-2 sentences).\n\r\n\n\r\nRewrite: \n\r\nTake the AI-generated message below and rewrite it to be short, direct, and punchy for an Israeli prospect.\n\r\nAI Message: \"I am reaching out because I believe our AI-powered platform could potentially help your esteemed organization significantly enhance your lead generation efforts and streamline your workflow for better results. Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call sometime next week?\"\n\r\n\n\r\nExplain: \n\r\nWhat did you remove and why?\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication Details:\n\r\nSend to: Angelina – Handshake Operations lead: \n\r\nSubject line: \"AI Message Specialist - [Your Name]\"\n\r\nResponse time: We review applications on a rolling basis and will respond within 5 business days.\n\r\nQuestions? Feel free to reach out before applying. We're happy to chat about the role, answer questions, or clarify anything that's unclear.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role Matters\n\r\nEvery message we send represents a client's brand and could be the start of a valuable business relationship. You're not just checking grammar, you're protecting reputations, building trust, and helping businesses grow.\n\r\nIn a world where AI is everywhere, the human touch has never been more valuable. If you're someone who cares about the details, understands the power of words, and wants to work at the intersection of AI and human connection, we'd love to hear from you.\n\r\nReady to be our human checkpoint? We're excited to meet you.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Real Estate Acquisitions Specialist (Remote)\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us\n\r\nPrice Real Estate Investments is a multi-market U.S. based real estate investment company focused on acquiring off-market properties directly from homeowners. We specialize in building strong relationships with sellers, negotiating with them, and closing deals virtually. Our team is fully remote, but our impact is nationwide — and we’re growing quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re looking for an experienced Real Estate Acquisitions Specialist to join our acquisitions team. This role is critical to our business: you’ll be speaking directly with homeowners, negotiating terms, and guiding sellers through the contract signing process. If you’ve personally made offers to sellers and closed contracts over the phone, this is an opportunity to put your skills to work in a high-energy, professional environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n$10/hour USD base pay\n\r\n\n\r\nPlus Monthly Contract Bonuses for getting offers accepted:\n\r\n• Bronze: 2 signed contracts = $500 bonus\n\r\n• Silver: 3 signed contracts = $1,000 bonus\n\r\n• Gold: 4 signed contracts = $1,500 bonus\n\r\n• Platinum: 5+ signed contracts = $2,000 bonus\n\r\n\n\r\nOn-target earnings can range from $2,500–$3,500+ per month depending on performance. Pay dates are on the 1st and 15th of each month.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe believe in rewarding results. Our top performers earn meaningful bonuses based on closed contracts and consistent production.\n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule\n\r\nFull-time, Monday to Friday\n\r\n9:00 AM – 6:00 PM CST\n\r\nRemote position, work from your own secure setup\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Be Doing\n\r\n- Engage with homeowners (seller leads), build authentic rapport, and manage conversations with professionalism\n\r\n- Follow a proven acquisitions script while sounding natural and confident\n\r\n- Ask strong follow-up questions to uncover seller motivation and property condition\n\r\n- Make verbal offers, negotiate price and terms, and walk sellers through agreements using DocuSign\n\r\n- Handle objections effectively and push deals forward toward signed contracts\n\r\n- Maintain organized notes, offers, and seller updates in our CRM\n\r\n- Collaborate closely with the acquisitions team and leadership\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat It Takes to Succeed Here\n\r\n- Relentless Follow-Up: Sellers don’t always respond the first time — or the second. You know how to stay persistent with calls, texts, and follow-ups until you get an answer. Nothing slips through the cracks on your watch.\n\r\n- Extreme Attention to Detail: Every call, every note, every update gets logged correctly in the CRM. You don’t miss details, and you take pride in keeping your pipeline organized. If you’ve ever been called meticulous or “on top of everything,” this is where you’ll shine.\n\r\n- Closer’s Mentality: You’re not just reading a script — you know how to listen, build rapport, and guide sellers toward a decision. You thrive on negotiation, handle objections with confidence, and create win-win agreements that get signed.\n\r\n- Driven by Results: You measure success by contracts closed. You hold yourself to high standards and push to hit — and exceed — your targets consistently. You’re motivated by performance and driven by the satisfaction of closing successful deals.\n\r\n- Resilient Problem-Solver: Whether it’s a tough seller, a pricing objection, or a complicated situation, you don’t freeze — you find solutions and move the deal forward. Challenges are part of the role, and you thrive in solving them under pressure.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n- Minimum 2+ years of experience in real estate acquisitions or seller negotiations\n\r\n- Proven track record of closing real estate deals and securing signed contracts\n\r\n- Excellent English communication skills (spoken and written)\n\r\n- Confidence and professionalism on the phone; ability to build trust and rapport quickly\n\r\n- Familiarity with real estate terms like ARV, repairs, inspection, contingencies, etc.\n\r\n- Strong work ethic, coachability, and ability to follow scripts while sounding natural\n\r\n- Proficiency with CRMs and outbound dialers\n\r\n- Reliable high-speed internet, updated computer, and a quiet workspace\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’re Looking For\n\r\n- A confident, friendly, and persuasive communicator who thrives on results\n\r\n- Someone who is organized, detail-oriented, and relentless in follow-up\n\r\n- A professional with the drive to close contracts and grow with a fast-moving team\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Join Us?\n\r\n- Competitive pay with structured bonuses\n\r\n- Real opportunities for growth in a professional investment company\n\r\n- Work remotely with a team that supports your success\n\r\n- A chance to close real deals, make a real impact, and develop long-term career skills in acquisitions\n\r\n\n\r\nAt Price Real Estate Investments, acquisitions is the heartbeat of our business. You’ll be in the front seat, driving growth and learning the strategies that power real deals across multiple U.S. markets.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply: (Read Carefully – Incomplete Applications Will Be Ignored)\n\r\n-\n us at: \n\r\n- Subject line: Real Estate Acquisitions Application – OJPH\n\r\n- Attach your resume with relevant real estate or sales experience\n\r\n- Include a 1–2 minute audio or video introduction about yourself and experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly applicants who follow all instructions will be considered.

We will give you a list of creators who attended each and you will find their TikTok handles.\n\nCreating creator campaigns on Growi and inputting creators’ Tiktok handles\n\nUsing a creator tracking software called Growi, you will create a separate campaign for each coaching Call. Then, you’ll add each creator who joined the respective call to the campaign using their handle you found earlier.\n\nSorting through Discord server members to identify top-performing TikTok Shop creators\n\nIn all of our brand’s Discord servers, we implement a ticket system that allows us to maintain 1 on 1 communication with all the top creators. \n\nYou will sort through all the members who join the Discord, find out their TikTok handle, and check their L30 day gmv on the TikTok Affiliate Center.\n\nThis is vital because it allows us to communicate with as many high potential creators as possible and maximize the number of videos they post.\n\nReaching out to creators to be a part of 7-day posting cohorts\n\nWe host 7 day posting cohorts where we take a group of 5 creators with potential to generate sales, put them in a group chat, and provide one video every day for them to replicate.\n\nYou will be in charge of identifying creators to be a part of these posting cohorts. Once you identify top performing TT Shop creators, you’re going to message them privately, asking if they want to be a part of the cohort.\n\nHandling additional weekly tasks that are assigned\n\nTurn new priorities from meetings, Slack, and ad?hoc requests into completed tasks with clear owners, deadlines, and visible progress. Ensure nothing falls through the cracks. \n\nDaily execution of team & administrative tasks\n\nIn addition to coaching the creators and maintaining these relationships, you will have a minimal amount of administrative tasks.\n\nDaily Check-Ins:\n\nProvide updates on what tasks you’ve been working on that day.\n\nReport findings of what’s working and what isn’t.\n\nShare ideas for improving client success.\n\nEnd of Day Report\n\nAt the end of each work day, you will be expected to complete a form outlining everything you completed for that day.\n\nWeekly Team Meeting\n\nAttend team check-in meeting via Google Meet every week.\n\n\n\nCompetencies:\n\nProficient in English \n\nPart of your job will require you to outreach hundreds of creators. You must be able to write clear, friendly DMs and hold a proper conversation with creators as needed. \n\nCommunication and responsiveness\n\nYou are active on Slack and respond to messages timely.\n\nHigh ownership and bias to action\n\nYou don’t wait for instructions on what to complete each day. You take action relentlessly and own the operations you’re in charge of.\n\nWhenever there’s a new batch of creators that join a brand’s Discord, you immediately begin looking them up on TikTok without me reminding you to.\n\nEvery week, there will be new tasks to handle. Upon hearing them, you will immediately spring to action and complete them as soon as possible.\n\nDisciplined\n\nA majority of your job will be manual work, but you’ll manage it at the highest quality. \n\nYou follow instructions exactly, document what you’ve completed every day, and don’t skip steps.\n\nOrganized\n\nYou will be in charge of tracking hundreds or even thousands of creators.

You'll be the person who takes our evidence-based mental wellness content and makes it pop—crafting videos that educate, engage, and maybe make people laugh while they learn why their brain does that weird thing.\n\n\n\nThis is for our YouTube channel \"Your Brain Explained,\" which is all about democratizing access to psychological tools and making brain science accessible (and fun). Think less talking-head lectures, more \"wait, THAT'S why I do that?!\" moments.\n\n\n\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\n\n\n• Editing videos in CapCut (or similar, but CapCut fluency is a strong preference)\n\n• Creating graphics, motion graphics, and visual elements that bring psychological concepts to life\n\n• Collaborating on the storytelling arc—helping shape how I present complex ideas in digestible, engaging ways\n\n• Cutting for pacing, energy, and retention (because even fascinating psychology content needs good editing)\n\n• Optimizing content for YouTube (thumbnails, titles, descriptions, all that good stuff)\n\n• Potentially creating YouTube Shorts and managing posting/publishing (bonus points if this is already in your toolkit)\n\n\n\nWhat I’m Looking For\n\n\n\nMust-Haves:\n\n• 1.5+ years of professional video editing experience, ideally for YouTube \n\n• Strong design skills and an eye for graphics that enhance (not overwhelm) the story\n\n• Proficiency in CapCut\n\n• Portfolio that shows you can make content engaging\n\n• Genuine interest in mental wellness, psychology, and how the brain works—you should actually care about this stuff\n\n\n\nBonus Points For:\n\n• Experience managing YouTube channels, creating Shorts, and understanding platform best practices\n\n• Motion graphics skills\n\n• A sense of humor that translates well visually\n\n• Experience working with founder-led brands or small teams where you wear multiple hats\n\n\n\nAbout MYNDY & Your Brain Explained\n\n\n\nMYNDY is a mental fitness platform that's all about giving people evidence-based psychological tools—think of it as democratized executive coaching. Our YouTube channel is part of that mission: making brain science and psychology accessible, practical, and honestly kind of fun.\n\n\n\nI value:\n\n• Research-backed content delivered in a human way\n\n• Authentic communication over corporate speak\n\n• Creativity and thoughtful iteration\n\n• People who bring energy and ideas to the table\n\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n• Part-time, formal arrangement\n\n• Remote-friendly\n\n• Opportunity to help build something meaningful from the ground up\n\n\n\nIf you're someone who lights up at the idea of making a video about why we ghost people or how feedback works in the brain, and you've got the chops to make it look fantastic—let's talk.\n\n\n\nTo Apply\n\n\n\nSend us:\n\n1. Your portfolio or links to recent work (YouTube content preferred)\n\n2. A brief note about why this role excites you\n\n3. What you'd charge for editing a 10-15 minute YouTube video\n\n\n\nI’m excited to meet you.                ",

    "description": "\n                    JOB DESCRIPTION\n\r\nAbout This Role\n\r\nI run a growing Amazon private-label brand and I need a reliable, switched-on VA to handle the content, design, and admin side of the business — so I can stay focused on the strategic side.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role does not require deep Amazon knowledge coming in. What it does require is someone who follows systems precisely, thinks clearly when a situation is not covered by a checklist, and takes pride in doing small things well.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you have used Canva, managed social media for a brand, and kept things organised without being chased — you are exactly who I am looking for.\n\r\n\n\r\nAmazon Seller Central admin will be part of this role over time. If you have done it before, great. If you have not, I will train you properly with written SOPs and video walkthroughs. What I cannot train is reliability, sincerity, and good judgment — those need to come with you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Be Doing\n\r\n1. Canva Design & Visual Content\n\r\n• Create secondary product images and lifestyle infographics using brand templates I provide\n\r\n• Design social media posts for Instagram and\n — a mix of product content, brand story, and educational posts\n\r\n• Refresh existing Canva designs seasonally or when products are updated\n\r\n• Maintain a consistent visual style across all outputs using the brand guideline document\n\r\n• Prepare simple A+ Content banner drafts in Canva for the founder to review and upload\n\r\n2. Social Media Scheduling & Management\n\r\n• Manage a monthly content calendar — populating it with approved post ideas and scheduling content in advance\n\r\n• Schedule posts across Instagram and\n using Buffer, Later, or the platform's native scheduler\n\r\n• Repurpose existing Amazon product content (images, copy, reviews) into social-ready formats\n\r\n• Monitor comments and DMs — respond to simple questions using approved templates, flag anything else\n\r\n• Track basic engagement metrics weekly (likes, reach, follower count) and include in the weekly report\n\r\n3. General Admin & Operations Support\n\r\n• Organise and maintain OneDrive folders — keep files named correctly, archived regularly, and easy to find\n\r\n• Handle data entry tasks: updating spreadsheets, logging product details, recording supplier information\n\r\n• Draft basic\ns and messages using templates and instructions provided\n\r\n• Research tasks — finding supplier contacts, checking competitor pricing, gathering information using clear search briefs\n\r\n• Maintain a shared task tracker so the founder always knows what is in progress and what is done\n\r\n4. Amazon Seller Central Admin (Trained Role — SOPs Provided)\n\r\n• Assist with uploading product images and updating listing content following exact step-by-step instructions\n\r\n• Help prepare FBA shipment documentation and labelling files when needed\n\r\n• Respond to basic buyer messages using pre-approved templates\n\r\n• Run simple reports and copy data into tracking spreadsheets\n\r\n• Flag anything unusual immediately — you are not expected to resolve it, just surface it clearly\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Experience Is Required vs Trained\n\r\nThis table shows exactly what you need to bring and what will be provided:\n\r\n\n\r\nArea Experience Required? How the Gap is Covered\n\r\nCanva or any other design platform YES — must have portfolio Brand templates provided\n\r\nSocial media scheduling YES — basic proficiency Content calendar + SOPs provided\n\r\nAmazon Seller Central admin PREFERRED but not required Full SOP + walkthrough training\n\r\nGeneral admin & data entry Basic computer literacy only Templated systems provided\n\r\nProduct research support NOT required Step-by-step SOPs provided\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Kind of Person This Role Is Built For\n\r\nSkills matter, but they are secondary in this hire. Here is the mindset profile I am hiring for:\n\r\n\n\r\n• You follow instructions carefully the first time — not after being reminded\n\r\n• When something is not covered by the SOP, you use common sense and flag what you did rather than freeze\n\r\n• You communicate proactively — if something is taking longer than expected or you are unsure, you say so before the deadline, not after\n\r\n• You take ownership of your tasks — the work is done properly because you care, not because someone is watching\n\r\n• You are consistent — the quality of your Monday morning work is the same as your Friday afternoon work\n\r\n• You are here for the long term — not filling a gap while looking for something else\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Is NOT\n\r\n• This is not a high-pressure strategy role — that is handled separately\n\r\n• You will not be expected to make decisions about the brand, pricing, or advertising\n\r\n• You will not be micromanaged — but you will be held accountable through weekly check-ins and clear KPIs\n\r\n• This is not short-term freelance work — I am looking for someone who will still be here in 18 months\n\r\n\n\r\nTools You Will Use\n\r\n• Canva/PhotoShop or any other tools — for all design work (templates provided)\n\r\n• Microsoft OneDrive — for file management, content calendar, and document storage\n\r\n• Instagram/TikTok/LinkedIn/FB/YouTube, etc. — for social media scheduling\n\r\n• Amazon Seller Central — for admin tasks (full training provided)\n\r\n• Slack — for daily async communication and updates\n\r\n• Trello — for task tracking and workflow management (setup provided)\n\r\n• Microsoft Teams — for regular video calls and check-ins\n\r\n\n\r\nSuccess Metrics — How You Will Be Evaluated\n\r\n• Design quality: Canva/PhotoShop or any other tools output match brand guidelines without needing major revisions\n\r\n• Content calendar: Posts scheduled and published on time — no missed dates\n\r\n• Admin accuracy: Data entry and file management contain zero errors on spot checks\n\r\n• Communication: Daily Slack update sent without prompting, questions asked before deadlines, not after\n\r\n• Amazon admin: Tasks completed following SOPs with no skipped steps\n\r\n• Judgment calls: When flagged issues come to the founder, they come with a brief explanation of what happened and what you observed — not just \"I don't know what to do\"\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Working Conditions\n\r\n• Starting at 20 hours per week with a clear path to full-time based on performance\n\r\n• Competitive hourly rate — discussed with shortlisted candidates\n\r\n• Paid trial task before final offer\n\r\n• Full onboarding and SOP training provided in Week 1\n\r\n• Performance review and pay discussion at the 6-month mark\n\r\n• Stable, long-term role with a founder who respects your time and communicates clearly\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nREAD THIS CAREFULLY. Applications that skip steps or ignore instructions will not be opened — this is itself a test of whether you are right for this role.\n\r\n\n\r\nSubmit all of the following — no more, no less:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. A short paragraph about yourself — who you are, what kind of work you do, and why this role interests you\n\r\n2. A list of tools you currently use for design, social media, and admin work\n\r\n3. At least two examples of Canva or any other design work you have created — image links, OneDrive links, or attachments\n\r\n4. Your answer to this scenario (write at least 3–4 sentences): \"You are scheduling this week's social media posts and you notice the brand colours in two of the images look slightly different from the rest. Your manager is unavailable. What do you do?\"\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT: The subject line of your application must begin with the word RELIABLE. Applications that do not follow this instruction will not be reviewed.                ",

We offer our clients iron-clad guarantees:\n\r\n\n\r\n- 10% of targeted keywords on Page 1 in 3 months.\n\r\n- 30% of targeted keywords on Page 1 in 6 months.\n\r\n- 60% of targeted keywords on Page 1 in 12 months.\n\r\n\n\r\nDoes this scare you, or does it excite you? If your first thought is \"That's impossible,\" keep scrolling. If your first thought is \"With my strategy and AI-driven efficiency, I can crush those numbers,\" then you’re the sniper we want.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Actually Be Doing (The Blueprint)\n\r\n- Architect of Success: You won't just advise on site structure; you’ll build the SEO Bible for our clients. You have the authority to see changes implemented.\n\r\n- AI Command & Control: You use AI models not as a crutch, but as an exoskeleton. You engineer complex prompts to automate audits, generate schema at scale, and dismantle competitor strategies piece by piece.\n\r\n- The Sherlock Holmes of Search: You conduct deep-dive technical, content, and backlink audits. You find the opportunities that Screaming Frog and Ahrefs miss because you know how to look beneath the data.\n\r\n- Translate Data into Dollars: You live in GA4 and Search Console. You ignore vanity metrics. Your focus is singular: qualified organic traffic that drives business growth.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Specialist’s Code (Is This You?)\n\r\n- Growth & Mastery: You have 3+ years in the trenches. You see a Google Update as an opportunity to leapfrog the competition, not a crisis.\n\r\n- Technical Dominance: You speak \"developer.\" You understand CMS limitations, cloud hosting, and how to work with technical teams to get it right the first time.\n\r\n- AI Power User: You are well-adept in prompt engineering. You know how to use AI to 10x your own output and accuracy.\n\r\n- Future Leader: You want to be in a commanding position. You aren't looking for a job to hide in; you're looking for a platform to lead and eventually run your own pod.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Real Pay-Off\n\r\n- Unleashed Autonomy: You get the freedom to test, experiment, and implement. This is your domain to master.\n\r\n- Remote Warfare: This is a 100% remote role. We care about the traffic graph moving up and to the right, not what chair you sit in.\n\r\n- No Nightmare Clients: We protect our warriors. If a client won't implement your expert recommendations, we fire them.\n\r\n- Empire Building: You are part of the core team. Your successes will be highly visible and critical to our 10x mission.\n\r\n\n\r\nReady to Enlist? Here’s where you can apply:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNothing else will be entertained.                ",

Our shorts should feel cinematic, elegant, hypnotic, visceral, and expensive. (Be prepared to innovate as demands and trends change.)\n\r\nYou will receive scripts, AI tool access, and style references. Your job is to build the scene: generate AI visuals, source archival footage, layer sound design, add voiceover from elevenlabs, and deliver shorts where every second earns the next.\n\r\nWe are hiring for taste, cinematic instinct, and the ability to treat AI generation as a serious production tool.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE STYLE\n\r\nMultiple styles as demand and trends change; Dark luxury. Museum. Stylish and lethal. Rich textures. Controlled palette. Both silence and impact used with intention. Every cut has a reason.\n\r\nNot: default presets, stock photo slideshows.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\nProduce vertical shorts (YouTube Shorts / TikTok / Reels) end-to-end using our scripts, style kits, and current channel benchmarks:\n\r\n\n\r\nEdit: Assemble 30-120s vertical shorts with elegant pacing and restraint. The voiceover leads — visuals serve. You know when to let a line breathe and when to accelerate.\n\r\nGenerate: Create supporting visuals using AI image and video tools (Seedream, Veo, Kling, and whatever launches next). We provide all paid accounts and internal prompting workflows — you bring creative judgment and iteration speed.\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Beat-matching, swells, drops, and silence to drive visual storytelling. You understand rhythm as an editing tool — not decoration.\n\r\nProduct Integration: Place static jewelry photos into moving scenes so they look physically present — masking, light/shadow matching, subtle color grading. Convincing realism, not floating stickers. (AI can handle lot of this, but requires a good eye for it.)\n\r\nFinish: Minimal kinetic typography + copyright-safe or licensed classical/atmospheric audio (Generated via Suno).\n\r\nFile Hygiene: Clean bin structure, naming conventions. Project files and assets uploaded Notion/\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCORE REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Eye. You instinctively know the difference between luxury and cheap. Starting out, you'll receive reference videos of our current benchmarks and experimental formats. Your job is to match that standard consistently and innovate on top of them.\n\r\nVoiceover-First Storytelling. You edit to narration first, music second. You never bury a punchline under a flashy transition.\n\r\nRetention Instinct. The first frame is an ad for the second frame. You know what stops a scroll. You build hooks visually. Every 2–3 seconds, something changes.\n\r\nAI Fluency. You're comfortable generating, iterating, and curating AI output across image and video tools. You treat generation as production — prompting, reviewing, selecting, and refining until the output meets the standard.\n\r\nAdobe Premiere Pro. Required for project handoffs and consistency.\n\r\nStrong English. Daily async communication — clear, direct, and professional.\n\r\nReliable & Coachable. You hit deadlines or warn early. You take direct feedback and iterate fast. You flag problems with options, not excuses.\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus (not required, but noticed):\n\r\nAfter Effects compositing, Mocha tracking, advanced color grading, sound design beyond music (SFX layering, risers, hits).\n\r\n\n\r\nVOLUME & DELIVERABLES\n\r\n\n\r\nRamp-up (first 2–3 weeks): 2–3 shorts/week as you learn the brand voice and pipeline\n\r\nSteady state: Push to 4 high quality vertical shorts per week.\n\r\nDeliverables: 1080×1920 minimum, 30fps, MP4 (H.264)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nRAM: 16GB minimum (32GB preferred) + SSD\n\r\nReliable high-speed internet (upload speed matters)\n\r\nMust run Premiere Pro and browser-based AI tools simultaneously without issue\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPAID TRIAL (Shortlisted Candidates)\n\r\nBefore any full-time commitment, we run a paid weekly trial. We provide scripts, elevenlabs access for voiceover, and style references/benchmarks. You deliver 30–50 second shorts. Trial is compensated at $250 USD at the end of each week. If it's a mutual fit after 30 days, we transition to bi-weekly payments of $550 (before work).\n\r\nThis protects both sides — you see whether the work fits your strengths, we see whether the output fits our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\r\n\n\r\nPaid accounts for all frontier AI tools\n\r\nCreative identity — you're building the visual language of a brand from launch, not filling someone else's template\n\r\nClear briefs — scripts, audio files, mood boards, and reference videos for every batch\n\r\nDirect feedback — specific, constructive notes on every edit\n\r\nA brand worth building — Prismiera launches soon, with a second and third AI-native brands after that, which cover a wide variety of content scopes. You're helping build the machine.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nOWNERSHIP & CONFIDENTIALITY\n\r\nAll outputs (edits, project files, prompts, generated assets) are Prismiera property and must remain confidential. \n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nImportant: Use at least 7 Apply Points when applying on OnlineJobs.ph.\n\r\nSubject line: PRISMIERA EDITOR — [Your Favorite Historical Art Era]\n\r\nSend only the following (numbered exactly):\n\r\n\n\r\nPortfolio. Links to your 3 best vertical shorts (mood/atmosphere preferred — not vlogs). Label one that demonstrates music-driven pacing.\n\r\nThe Story Test. Link to ONE short that includes voiceover or spoken dialogue. We need to see that you can pace visuals to a script. (Can overlap with #1.)\n\r\nLuxury Test (3–5 bullets). How do you make an edit feel \"expensive\" instead of \"cheap\"?\n\r\nAI Experience (1–2 sentences). What is your experience level with generative AI tools? If none, say so — we'll evaluate the rest on its own merits.\n\r\nTechnical (exactly 3 sentences). Describe your approach to compositing a static product photo into a moving scene so it looks physically present.\n\r\nSpecs. PC specs (CPU / GPU / RAM / SSD) + internet upload speed (screenshot preferred).\n\r\nIntegrity (1–2 sentences). Describe a time you missed a deadline or made a mistake — what did you do next?\n\r\nThe Rewrite. Rewrite this sentence in a cinematic tone: \"She is really cool and strong and she wins.\"                ",

You will collaborate closely with the TVR team on content creation and platform selection, gradually taking on more ownership as you become familiar with our product and voice.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES: GROWTH MARKETING & SOCIAL MEDIA\n\r\n\n\r\n- Help develop and execute a social media growth strategy across multiple platforms (helping identify which platforms are the best fit for our audience is part of the role)\n\r\n- Help create, schedule, and publish engaging content that drives traffic to the TVR website (using tools like FeedHive or similar scheduling platforms)\n\r\n- Help build and grow our audience from zero to a thriving community of people interested in cryptocurrency fundamental analysis\n\r\n- Help design a content funnel: social media content that brings visitors to the free site, and nurture strategies that convert free users into paying subscribers\n\r\n- Monitor and respond to comments and engagement across all platforms, filtering out spam and trolls while identifying and nurturing genuine conversations\n\r\n- Track performance metrics (follower growth, engagement rates, click-throughs, conversions) and report on what is working and what is not\n\r\n- Create or source visual content (graphics, short videos, infographics) to support posts\n\r\n- Collaborate with the team on content ideas and contribute to the editorial calendar\n\r\n- Repurpose long-form content (educational articles, coin analyses) into platform-specific social media content. One article should become multiple posts optimized for each platform's format and audience.\n\r\n- Help manage\n marketing campaigns and newsletter content through MailerLite\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSECONDARY RESPONSIBILITIES: VIRTUAL ASSISTANT TASKS\n\r\n\n\r\n- Filter and organize social media replies and messages, flagging items that require a team response\n\r\n- Assist with formatting and uploading content to the website\n\r\n- Help manage the newsletter subscriber list and\n workflows\n\r\n- Light research tasks as needed (competitor analysis, content ideas, trending topics in the space)\n\r\n- General administrative support related to the TVR platform\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nA NOTE ABOUT THIS ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nOur analysis methodology produces results based on measurable fundamentals. Sometimes those results challenge popular opinion within cryptocurrency communities. This means our social media will occasionally attract strong reactions from passionate supporters of specific projects. We see this as an opportunity, not a problem. The right person for this role is someone who can engage professionally with criticism, turn heated \nnts into teaching opportunities, and remain calm and measured when others are not. If you thrive under that kind of challenge, you will love this role.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS\n\r\n\n\r\n- C2 (Advanced/Proficient) English language skills, both written and verbal. This is non-negotiable. You will be writing public-facing content and representing the brand.\n\r\n- At least 1 year of experience managing social media accounts for a business or brand (not personal accounts). You must be able to provide links to accounts you have managed.\n\r\n- Demonstrated ability to grow a social media following and drive measurable engagement (provide at least one example with results)\n\r\n- Strong written communication skills with clean grammar and a professional tone\n\r\n- Experience creating visual content for social media (graphics, short-form video, infographics)\n\r\n- Self-motivated and able to work independently with minimal supervision\n\r\n- Comfortable with weekly video calls for strategy discussions\n\r\n- Comfortable working within detailed brand guidelines and receiving regular feedback on content. We approve all posts before publishing, especially in the early stages, and we need someone who thrives in a collaborative feedback loop rather than resisting it.\n\r\n- Strong proactive communication skills. In a remote, asynchronous environment, we need someone who flags issues, shares updates, and proposes solutions without being asked.\n\r\n- Proficient in using AI tools (such as Claude, Gemini, X.ai, Midjourney, or similar) as part of a professional workflow. We are not looking for casual users. We want someone who actively integrates AI into their work to move faster and produce better results.\n\r\n- Reliable internet connection and a quiet workspace for video calls\n\r\n- Experience with growth marketing, conversion funnels, or\n marketing strategy\n\r\n- Basic graphic design skills (Canva or similar tools)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS (NICE TO HAVE)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Familiarity with cryptocurrency or fintech (you do not need to be an expert, but genuine curiosity about the space is a strong plus)\n\r\n- Experience with social media scheduling tools (FeedHive, Buffer, Hootsuite, or similar)\n\r\n- Experience with\n marketing platforms (MailerLite, Mailchimp, or similar)\n\r\n- Basic video editing skills (for short-form social content)\n\r\n- Experience working with startups or early-stage companies\n\r\n- Experience with Google Analytics or similar web analytics tools (understanding traffic sources, user behavior, and conversion tracking)\n\r\n- Experience building a social media presence from scratch (growing from zero), not just managing established accounts\n\r\n- Basic understanding of SEO principles (keyword awareness, meta descriptions, content structure for search visibility)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSCHEDULE, COMPENSATION & LOGISTICS\n\r\n\n\r\n- Part-time: 20 hours per week (4 hours/day, 5 days/week) with the possibility of increasing to 30-40 hours as the platform grows\n\r\n- Starting pay rate: $6-10+ USD/hour depending on experience and qualifications, with structured milestone raises tied to measurable platform growth. As the platform succeeds, your compensation grows with it. Full details discussed with shortlisted candidates.\n\r\n- The first 2 weeks serve as a mutual trial period for both sides to confirm the fit.\n\r\n- Payment method: Wise\n\r\n- Flexible schedule: Most work can be done on your own time since posts will be scheduled in advance. We do ask for availability during peak engagement hours when possible, and one weekly video strategy call with the team.\n\r\n- This is a contractor position with no tax withholding or benefits requirements\n\r\n- Start date: Late February / Early March 2026\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY JOIN TVR?\n\r\n\n\r\n- Ground-floor opportunity: You will shape the marketing strategy from day one, not inherit someone else's playbook\n\r\n- Growth potential: As the platform scales, so does your role, your hours, and your compensation. We are building this for the long term.\n\r\n- Creative ownership: We want your ideas and your voice, not just your hands on a keyboard\n\r\n- Work with a team that values quality over speed, honesty over hype, and substance over noise\n\r\n- Learn about fintech, data-driven analysis, and the cryptocurrency industry while getting paid to do it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nWe read every application carefully. To help us identify serious candidates, please include ALL FOUR of the following in your application:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. SUBJECT LINE KEYWORD: Include the phrase \"Steady Growth\" somewhere in the subject line of your application. This tells us you read the entire posting.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. PORTFOLIO LINKS: Provide links to at least 2 social media accounts you have managed for a business or brand (not your personal accounts). For each one, include a brief note about the results you achieved (follower growth, engagement metrics, or any other relevant numbers).\n\r\n\n\r\n3. BEST CAMPAIGN: Share a link to one social media campaign or piece of content you are most proud of, with a short explanation (2-3 sentences) of why it worked and what results it produced.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. WRITTEN RESPONSE: In 3-5 sentences, explain in your own words what \"fundamental analysis\" means when evaluating an investment. There is no single right answer. We are looking for clear thinking and strong writing, not technical expertise.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that do not include all four items will not be reviewed. We know this takes extra effort, and that is the point. We are looking for someone who pays attention to detail and follows through.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWe look forward to hearing from you.\n\r\n\n\r\nTrue Value Rankings | \n                ",

    "description": "\n                    About Us\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a Toronto-based creative production company (TRE Media, a division of Mshati Productions) producing premium real estate content for agents and brokerages across the GTA. We have shot some of the most expensive listings in Toronto and deliver 3-5 properties per week across photo, video, and 360 tours.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not a one-person operation. We have a production team, admin/ops staff, and established systems. We need an editor who can slot into our workflow, own their deliverables, and keep pace without being micromanaged.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be our primary video editor. You will receive raw footage via Dropbox, follow a structured brief, and deliver two formats per property:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Horizontal video (1-3 min) - cinematic property tour for MLS, YouTube, and agent websites. Smooth pacing, clean color, logical walkthrough flow.\n\r\n2. Vertical reel (30-60 sec) - high-energy cut for Instagram Reels / TikTok. Music-driven, punchy, scroll-stopping.\n\r\n\n\r\nVolume is typically 3-5 properties per week. Some weeks are heavier. You will be expected to manage your own queue.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Actually Care About\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have worked with editors who wait to be told what to do, who treat \"I need music\" as a reason to stop, who go silent for days, and who deliver sloppy first cuts hoping we will catch the problems. That is not what we are hiring for.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone who:\n\r\n- Starts immediately when footage lands - not 2 days later\n\r\n- Picks music themselves unless told otherwise (you are the editor - have taste)\n\r\n- Communicates proactively - \"Starting now,\" \"First cut ready by tomorrow 2pm,\" \"This property has a lighting issue, here is how I handled it\"\n\r\n- Self-QCs before submitting - check your own work against the standard before sending it for review\n\r\n- Hits turnaround times - first cut within 24 hours. Final delivery within 48 hours.\n\r\n- Follows the system - we use \n for tracking and Dropbox for files. You update your status there.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a casual freelance gig. It is a core production role.\n\r\n\n\r\nDeliverable Standards (What Done Means)\n\r\n\n\r\nEvery video must pass all 5 before delivery:\n\r\n1. Flow is logical (walkthrough makes sense - entry to rooms to exterior)\n\r\n2. Color is clean (natural whites, consistent exposure and white balance)\n\r\n3. Coverage is sufficient (key rooms shown with establishing + detail angles)\n\r\n4. Transitions are invisible unless motivated (no gimmick transitions)\n\r\n5. Pacing supports clarity (not rushed, no disorienting motion)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are expected to catch these yourself before submitting.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Workflow\n\r\n1. Shooter uploads raw footage to Dropbox and completes an editor brief\n\r\n2. You receive notification via \n with the brief\n\r\n3. You edit both horizontal + reel, export to our specs, upload finals to Dropbox\n\r\n4. You mark status as Ready for QC in \n\r\n5. Ops reviews. Revisions turned around same day.\n\r\n\n\r\nSoftware: Adobe Premiere Pro (required). After Effects and DaVinci Resolve are bonuses.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n- Real estate property tour editing experience - portfolio with RE samples required (no exceptions)\n\r\n- Advanced Premiere Pro skills\n\r\n- Computer that can handle 4K 10-bit footage\n\r\n- Fast stable internet + Dropbox experience for large file transfers\n\r\n- Strong sense of pacing, color, and music selection\n\r\n- Can work independently with minimal supervision\n\r\n- Responsive communication (acknowledge messages within 1 hour during work hours)\n\r\n- Available for full-time or near full-time hours\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have\n\r\n- Motion graphics (text overlays, lower thirds, animations)\n\r\n- Experience with North American / Western clients\n\r\n- Color grading beyond basic correction\n\r\n- Can handle brand/corporate video edits (not just RE)\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n- Per-project pay to start (rate depends on experience - tell us your rate)\n\r\n- Consistent volume: 3-5 projects/week minimum\n\r\n- Opportunity to move to monthly retainer once trust is established\n\r\n- Paid test project for shortlisted candidates\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nInclude ALL of the following or your application will be skipped:\n\r\n1. Portfolio - 2-3 real estate property tour videos you edited (links, not screenshots)\n\r\n2. Computer specs - CPU, GPU, RAM, internet speed\n\r\n3. Your rate - per horizontal video and per reel, in USD\n\r\n4. Availability - hours per day, days per week, timezone\n\r\n5. Brief intro - 3-4 sentences max. Why you? What makes you different?                ",

The editing energy leans closer to a perfectly-timed After Effects edit / storytelling than a corporate product video. (You have an eye for aesthetics and cinematography)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will receive a script, a voiceover file, and a mood reference. Your job is to build the scene from nothing: generate AI visuals, voiceovers, source archival footage, layer sound design, and deliver a short where every second earns the next. A visual storyteller. (We provide access to the frontier generation models)\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Style\n\r\n\n\r\nYES: Dark luxury. Museum. AE VFX edit. Stylish/Lethal. Fun. Rich textures. Clean typography. Controlled palette. Both silence and impact used with intention.\n\r\n\n\r\nNO: CapCut default presets. Anything that looks like a stock photo slideshow or a corporate deck.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand that more effects does not necessarily mean better. Every cut has a reason.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Skills (Non-Negotiables)\n\r\n\n\r\nMotion Graphics - You can build scenes, transitions, and visual elements from scratch in After Effects - not just cut footage.\n\r\n\n\r\nVoiceover-First Storytelling - You are editing to a narration primarily, music track second. You know when to let a line breathe and when to accelerate. You never bury the script's punchline under a flashy transition. The voice leads - the visuals serve.\n\r\n\n\r\nRetention Instinct - You understand that the first frame is an ad for the second frame. You know what stops a scroll. You build hooks visually, not just with text overlays. Every 2–3 seconds, something changes.\n\r\n\n\r\nRhythm & Beat-Sync - You can sync cuts, zooms, and effects to music. You understand \"the drop.\" If you've made AMVs, fan/anime edits, or phonk edits, you already have this skill - we want you to apply it with restraint.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI-Assisted Asset Creation - You are comfortable generating images and short clips using tools like Midjourney or Kling. (We usually move onto new tools as soon as they are released). You treat AI as a production tool, not a novelty. We provide all paid accounts - you bring the creative judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Skills (Not Required, But We'll Notice)\n\r\n\n\r\n- After Effects compositing - Mocha tracking, light matching (future projects will involve product placement in video scenes)\n\r\n- Typography sense - fonts that feel intentional, never default\n\r\n- Color grading - pushing AI output and footage into a consistent palette\n\r\n- Sound design beyond music - layering SFX on movement, crafting risers and hits\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWeekly Output\n\r\n\n\r\nRamp-up (first 2–3 weeks): 2–3 shorts as you learn the brand voice and pipeline.\n\r\nSteady state: 4–5 shorts per week at the locked quality standard.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work from clear creative briefs with reference scripts, mood boards, and audio clips for most batches.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a generic cover letter.\n\r\nUse 7 apply points or more when applying.\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: Lethal Editor - [Your name]\n\r\n\n\r\nSend the following (in this order):\n\r\n\n\r\n1. The Story Test. Link to ONE short-form video you edited that includes voiceover or spoken dialogue. We need to see that you can pace visuals to a script.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. The AE Style Test. Link to ONE video that shows your visual rhythm and editing craft - an AMV, fan edit, fashion reel, or anything where the editing itself is the skill. It doesn't need to be \"dark\" or \"luxury.\" It needs to show us how you think about pacing and impact.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. AI Experience (1 sentence). What is your experience level with generative AI tools (Midjourney, seedream, Kling, etc.)? If none, say so - we'll evaluate the rest of your application on its own merits.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Hardware. Your PC specs: CPU / GPU / RAM. Plus your internet upload speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Turnaround Estimate. How long does a 30–50 second high-quality short typically take you, start to finish?\n\r\n\n\r\n6. The Rewrite. Rewrite this sentence to sound dark, powerful, and modern: \"She is really cool and strong and she wins.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nPaid Trial (Shortlisted Candidates)\n\r\n\n\r\nBefore any full-time commitment, we run a weekly paid trial. We provide real scripts and style references. You deliver 30–50 second shorts. Trial is compensated at $250 USD at the end of each week (after work). If it's a mutual fit after 30 days, we transition to $550 USD payments every 2 weeks (before work).\n\r\n\n\r\nThis protects both of us - you see whether the work fits your strengths, we see whether the output fits our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n- Paid accounts for all frontier AI tools; seedance2.0, seedream5.0, etc.\n\r\n- Creative identity - you're building the visual identity of a brand from launch, not filling someone else's template\n\r\n- Clear briefs - most, if not every batch comes with scripts, audio files, mood boards, and specific reference videos\n\r\n- Direct feedback - specific, constructive notes on every edit.\n\r\n- A brand worth building - Prismiera launches April 2026. A second AI native game/anime brand after that. You're not joining a machine. You're helping build one.                ",

A strong understanding of English and social media content is crucial here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nVery basic content - this will take up a majority of your workload and will consist of usually one main video thats about 5-10 minutes long, 1-2 photos that need to be addressed, and maybe a request to add a caption.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be working hand in hand with me on an extremely viral social media page and there is room for bonuses if deadlines are met and the content performs well!\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\nAttention to detail\n\r\nSTRONG English\n\r\nStrong internet connection\n\r\nPrevious experience with Capcut / TikTok / Instagram\n\r\nGood working with a team\n\r\nAbility to learn and take constructive feedback\n\r\nAvailability to work 3-4h a day (with potential for more and increased salary)\n\r\nAble to work 5-6 days per week (can take days off whenever as long as mostly consistent)\n\r\nCan take payments through Wise, Zelle, Paypal, Cashapp, etc\n\r\nPH or similar time zone\n\r\n\n\r\n$300/month + bonuses for 2-3h a day MAX and potential full time work in the future with a salary increase.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please complete the recreate assignment below so I can see your skills (1h max)\n\r\n\n\r\nBelow is a Google drive with the original files you will need to re-create this reference video:\n\r\n\n\r\nReference video: one reference video is in the google drive upper \"edited chest\" and then here is the link to the other: \n\r\n\n\r\nGoogle drive: \n\r\n\n\r\nPlease complete the following steps:\n\r\nDownload the files and import into your video editing software\n\r\nFind the “good” takes of the audio sections and stitch together to complete the voiceover\n\r\nFind the corresponding footage to match what is being said in the voiceover\n\r\nPay close attention to detail in the selection of the clips, the pacing (duration of each scene), cropping, etc.\n\r\nMessage me with a link to the re-created video                ",

We are currently focused on TikTok but actively looking to expand to other platforms such as Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and\n. Our videos range from 15 seconds to 1.5 minutes in length, and we need someone who can turn raw footage and assets into scroll-stopping, high-converting content.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is an excellent opportunity for someone who is passionate about short-form video, understands what makes people stop scrolling, and wants to grow with a fast-moving team. Beyond editing, we’d love someone who can help guide our expansion into new platforms and bring insight into what works across different audiences and algorithms.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU’LL BE DOING\n\r\n• Edit and produce short-form video ads (15 seconds to 1.5 minutes) for affiliate product campaigns\n\r\n• Apply creative transitions, motion graphics, text overlays, and sound design to make content engaging and on-brand\n\r\n• Edit and optimize content primarily for TikTok, with a focus on helping us expand to Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and\n\r\n• Collaborate with the team on creative direction, messaging, and hooks that drive conversions\n\r\n• Provide guidance on platform-specific best practices, trends, and content strategies as we grow beyond TikTok\n\r\n• Manage multiple projects simultaneously and deliver edits on schedule\n\r\n• Stay current with trending editing styles, effects, and platform-specific best practices\n\r\n• Resize, reformat, and repurpose existing content for different aspect ratios and placements\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\n\r\n• Proven experience editing short-form video content (portfolio or samples required)\n\r\n• Proficiency in video editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, CapCut, DaVinci Resolve, or similar tools\n\r\n• Strong sense of pacing, storytelling, and visual composition for short attention spans\n\r\n• Ability to work with product footage, stock assets, screen recordings, and UGC-style content\n\r\n• Understanding of what makes affiliate/ad content perform well on social media\n\r\n• Reliable internet connection and ability to communicate during overlapping work hours\n\r\n• Attention to detail and ability to incorporate feedback quickly\n\r\n\n\r\nNICE TO HAVE\n\r\n• Familiarity with affiliate marketing or direct response advertising\n\r\n• Basic understanding of ad performance metrics (CTR, watch time, hook rate)\n\r\n• Experience creating content specifically for TikTok Shop or similar platforms\n\r\n• Ability to source and sync royalty-free music and sound effects\n\r\n• Track record of helping a brand or creator expand from one platform to multiple platforms (e.g., TikTok to Reels/Shorts)\n\r\n• Understanding of how algorithms, formats, and audience behavior differ across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nTo be considered for this role, please include ALL of the following with your application. Incomplete applications will not be reviewed.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 1: Introduction Video\n\r\nRecord a short video introduction of yourself (2–3 minutes). Tell us who you are, your experience with video editing, the tools you use, and why you’re interested in this role. Upload it to Google Drive, YouTube (unlisted), or Loom and include the link in your application. This helps us get to know you and evaluate your communication skills.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 2: Portfolio / Reel\n\r\nShare a link to your portfolio or reel that showcases your best short-form video edits. We want to see your creativity, pacing, and ability to keep viewers engaged.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 3: Short Quiz\n\r\nPlease answer the following questions directly in your application message:\n\r\n1. You receive raw product footage that is poorly lit and shaky. The client needs the ad delivered by end of day. Walk us through how you would handle this situation.\n\r\n2. A 60-second affiliate ad you edited has a high view count but a very low click-through rate. What would you change in the next version and why?\n\r\n3. What is the most important element of a short-form video ad in the first 3 seconds, and how do you approach creating it?\n\r\n4. You’re given a product you’ve never heard of before and no creative brief. How do you research and d\n on an editing approach?\n\r\n5. We currently post our affiliate content on TikTok and want to start expanding to other platforms. Which platform would you recommend we expand to first, and what changes would you make to our TikTok content to perform well there?\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 4: Application Details\n\r\n• A brief description of the tools and software you use daily\n\r\n• Your availability and preferred working hours (Philippine time)\n\r\n• Your expected hourly salary rate\n\r\n\n\r\nTEST PROJECT\n\r\nShortlisted candidates will be invited to complete a short test project before a final hiring decision is made. You will receive raw assets and information, and we’ll ask you to produce a sample affiliate ad edit (15–60 seconds). This gives both of us a chance to see how we work together and ensures the role is a good fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe test project should take no more than one hour to complete.\n\r\n\n\r\n?  Important: Applications that do not include the introduction video, quiz answers, and portfolio link will not be considered. We are looking for candidates who pay attention to detail and can follow instructions — this is part of the evaluation.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing your creativity and the opportunity to work with you!

The team includes 3 Bay Area appraisers and 6 employees in the Philippines. We are rapidly growing and are looking for an experienced and senior level residential report writer/manager to join our team.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour role will be to do the following:\n\r\n1. Complete the entire residential appraisal report after the appraiser has provided you with the inspection information and comparables. This includes all the commentary, adjustments, and all other parts of the report. We will provide training on how we specifically expect the commentary and adjustments based on our own personal preferences, however you are expected to already have this type of experience working for other appraisers.\n\r\n2. Review the work of other report writers on our team, provide feedback, and help train newer report writers on our team. You are expected to act as the \"last line of defense\" of the report before it is sent to the appraiser for their final review before submission. As such, we expect you to be able to review the report, find any issues, correct these issues, and then send to the appraiser a near perfect report.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo be considered for this role, you must meet the following criteria:\n\r\n1. You have worked for a US residential appraiser\n\r\n2. You have experience performing data entry for residential properties in the US\n\r\n3. You have experience creating the 1004MC, selecting comparables, drawing the sketch, labeling photos, making adjustments to the sales grid, and making commentary for the addendum.\n\r\n4. Ideally, you have experience managing other appraisal report writers.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are flexible with your work hours and offer Philippine daytime shift hours for your convenience. We would like to start part time but then transition to full time, so ideally you are open to working full time exclusively with us if its a mutual fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo be considered for this position, you must do the following in your application message (failure to do all of the following will result in your application being ignored):\n\r\n1. How many years have you worked for a US residential appraiser? What tasks did you perform for them?\n\r\n2. How many hours does it take you to complete one report? What parts of the report do you complete?\n\r\n3. Do you have experience writing commentary for the addendum, drawing the sketch, labeling photos, and creating the 1004MC? Please indicate which ones you have experience with, and how many years for each.\n\r\n4. Please provide a sample of at least one appraisal report you have fully completed. You can redact any private information from the report. Please let me know what parts exactly you completed on this report(s).\n\r\n5. Provide a publicly accessible link to your resume.\n\r\n6. Are you open to starting part time and then transitioning to full time? Once working full time with us, will you be working exclusively with us without any other jobs? When is the earliest you can begin working with us?\n\r\n7. What are your preferred working hours?\n\r\n8. Do you have experience managing other residential appraisal report writers? If so, please discuss in detail your job responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you, and I look forward to the opportunity to work together.                ",
