We’re investing into better cameras, better production, and better systems — now we want a killer editor/content manager to take our output to the next level.\n\n\n\nThis is a long-term role. We value loyalty and consistency. If you’re great, we want you with us for years.\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nThe Mission\n\n\n\nCreate premium, TV-quality real estate content that:\n\n 1. Builds trust and authority\n\n 2. Keeps viewers watching\n\n 3. Drives real conversations and closings\n\n\n\nWe’re not chasing random virality. We’re building a conversion-focused relocation brand that consistently generates business.\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nYour Core Responsibilities (what you own)\n\n\n\n1) Long-Form YouTube Editing (High Priority)\n\n\n\nBaseline expectation: ~ 5-10 long-form videos/week (varies by filming schedule)\n\n • Home tours (cinematic, clean pacing, thoughtful B-roll support)\n\n • Studio videos / educational videos (clear structure, tasteful graphics)\n\n • Weekly market update (edited version OR support for a live workflow + polish)\n\n\n\nQuality standard: clean audio, strong pacing, strong story flow, polished color, tasteful music, lower-thirds where useful, and “TV-quality” feel.\n\n\n\n2) Shorts / Reels / TikTok Repurposing\n\n • Pull best moments from long-form\n\n • Create 5–10 shorts/week depending on volume\n\n • Add captions, quick hooks, pattern interrupts, and clean formatting\n\n\n\n3) Thumbnails + Title Packaging Support\n\n • Create high-converting thumbnails that match our brand style\n\n • Provide 2–3 thumbnail variations when needed\n\n • Support title/description packaging using our SEO/conversion-first workflow (we have templates and AI tools)\n\n\n\n4) Scheduling / Publishing (No Confusion)\n\n\n\nYou are responsible for publishing the videos you edit:\n\n • Upload YouTube long + Shorts\n\n • Ensure correct metadata: title, description, tags, chapters when applicable\n\n • Coordinate with our Ops VA so tasks do not overlap:\n\n • You publish YouTube content (long + Shorts) and deliver social-ready files\n\n • Ops VA posts across IG/FB/TikTok + handles DMs/comments + lead routing\n\n\n\n(If you’re a unicorn who can do everything, great — but we still keep responsibilities clearly separated.)\n\n\n\n5) Content System Support (Optional Upside)\n\n\n\nNice-to-have, not required:\n\n • Basic blog post drafts from video transcripts (AI-assisted)\n\n • Simple website/WordPress edits or landing page assistance (Brayden leads marketing)\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nWhat You Are NOT Responsible For\n\n • Running paid ads (Brayden does ads)\n\n • Filming (Brayden is on camera; we may add local videographer later)\n\n • Being an ISA or handling lead follow-up (Ops VA handles CRM/lead ops)\n\n • Writing complex scripts from scratch (Brayden + AI handle scripting; you can assist)\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nWhat “Great” Looks Like (Performance Expectations)\n\n • Videos are consistently delivered on schedule\n\n • Editing quality improves retention and watchability\n\n • Thumbnails look premium and compete with top channels in our niche\n\n • Shorts consistently look clean and native to platform\n\n • You’re proactive: you spot ways to improve workflow, pacing, packaging, and consistency\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nSkills & Requirements\n\n\n\nMust-have:\n\n • Strong editing skills (Premiere Pro, Final Cut, or DaVinci Resolve)\n\n • Strong audio cleanup and pacing instincts\n\n • Real examples of long-form YouTube work (portfolio required)\n\n • Understanding of YouTube packaging (thumbnail + title + hook + retention)\n\n • Able to follow brand templates and SOPs consistently\n\n\n\nNice-to-have:\n\n • Motion graphics / lower thirds (tasteful, not cheesy)\n\n • Color grading\n\n • Thumbnail design experience in Photoshop/Canva\n\n • YouTube channel growth experience (retention + CTR improvements)\n\n • Real estate content experience (a plus, not required)\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nCompensation (Salary + Closing Bonuses)\n\n\n\nWe prefer a full-time salary or flat weekly pay based on skill and output. We’ll set compensation after reviewing your portfolio and turnaround speed.\n\n\n\nClosing Bonus (clean + grounded)\n\n\n\nWe pay bonuses only when a deal closes that is clearly attributed to our content funnels.\n\n • $150 per closed house transaction attributed to content funnel/link tracking\n\n • $75 per closed lot transaction attributed to content funnel/link tracking\n\n • Paid at closing only. If it doesn’t close, no bonus.\n\n\n\nHow attribution works (simple):\n\n • Leads who come in through your tracked links/UTM pages or are logged as “Content/YouTube/Organic” in CRM.\n\n • This is not based on views. It’s based on closed business.\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nOur Content Pillars (What You’ll Be Editing)\n\n 1. Market updates (weekly)\n\n 2. Home tours (weekly)\n\n 3. Lifestyle/community tours (weekly/bi-weekly)\n\n 4. Relocation/education videos (evergreen)\n\n\n\nWe want everything to look like it belongs on TV — clean, premium, and consistent.\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nApplication Instructions (Required)\n\n\n\nTo apply, please send:\n\n 1. Your portfolio (2–4 examples of long-form YouTube edits + 2–4 shorts)\n\n 2. Your editing software (Premiere/Resolve/etc.) and weekly capacity\n\n 3. Your preferred compensation structure (weekly salary range)\n\n 4. Answer these questions:\n\n\n\n • How long does it take you to edit a 15–25 minute home tour to premium quality?\n\n • Can you create thumbnails? If yes, show 2 examples.\n\n • Are you comfortable turning long-form into shorts quickly and consistently?\n\n\n\nPaid Test (required)\n\n\n\nFinal candidates will receive a short paid test:\n\n • 1 long-form segment + request for 2 shorts + 1 thumbnail concept\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nWhy This Role Is Different\n\n\n\nWe’re building a real business, not a vanity channel. If you want to be part of a team where content directly drives closings (and you can share in the upside), this is for you.\n\n\n\nLong-term, this role can grow into a Content Director position managing additional editors and a bigger content pipeline.

    "description": "\n                    I am a professional writer who publishes regularly for a major digital publication. I am looking for a highly detail-oriented Digital Editorial Assistant to help with consistent, process-driven tasks that support my publishing workflow.\n\r\nThis is not a writing role. You will not be creating original articles or contributing editorial voice. Instead, you will help take repetitive, mechanical tasks off my plate so I can focus on research and writing.\n\r\nCore Responsibilities\n\r\n• Review completed articles and apply a detailed formatting rule system (which I will provide).\n\r\n• Correct stylistic and formatting elements such as italics usage, punctuation rules, capitalization, abbreviations (e.g., U.S.), numeral formatting, headline structure, and other publication-specific standards.\n\r\n• Ensure consistency and precision across every article.\n\r\n• Create SEO support materials based on provided guidelines (e.g., headline suggestions, summaries, key phrases).\n\r\n• Insert internal hyperlinks within articles according to provided direction.\n\r\n• Review AI-assisted outputs and confirm accuracy before returning final drafts.\n\r\nI currently use AI tools as part of my workflow. You are welcome to use AI tools to help complete tasks efficiently, but the final responsibility for accuracy, formatting compliance, and quality control will be yours.\n\r\nWhat This Role Is Not\n\r\n• You will not be writing opinion pieces or developing story ideas.\n\r\n• You will not be responsible for publishing decisions.\n\r\n• You will not need access to publishing platforms.\n\r\nThis role is focused on structure, compliance, formatting precision, and process execution.\n\r\nIdeal Candidate\n\r\n• Extremely detail-oriented and comfortable working from a strict style guide.\n\r\n• Strong written English skills and excellent grammar knowledge.\n\r\n• Comfortable following rule systems without improvising or altering tone.\n\r\n• Reliable, organized, and responsive.\n\r\n• Comfortable using Google Docs and collaborating in shared documents.\n\r\n• Familiarity with digital publishing or SEO basics is a plus but not required.\n\r\nThe right person for this role enjoys making things clean, correct, and consistent. Small details matter here.\n\r\nWorkflow & Communication\n\r\nWork will be assigned through Google Docs. I may tag you when new articles are ready for formatting. Turnaround time will typically be within a few hours to one day, depending on volume.\n\r\nHours will start between 5–10 hours per week, with potential for additional work over time. Schedule is flexible, but availability and responsiveness are important.\n\r\nLong-Term Potential\n\r\nThis role may expand to include additional research, digital organization, and publishing support tasks as we build trust and establish workflow rhythm.\n\r\nIf you are organized, precise, comfortable working with structured guidelines, and interested in supporting a high-output digital publishing workflow, I would love to hear from you.\n\r\nPlease include in your application:\n\r\nA brief description of your experience with formatting or editorial support.\n\r\nConfirmation that you are comfortable working from detailed style rules.\n\r\nYour weekly availability and expected hourly rate.

    "description": "\n                    JOB TITLE: Social Media Visual Editor — AI Persona & Aspirational Short-Form\n\r\nSALARY: $1,100 USD/month\n\r\nTYPE: Full-time (40 hours/week)\n\r\nLOCATION: Remote (Philippines)\n\r\nSCHEDULE: Async, with Vancouver overlap (PST) for feedback\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Mission\n\r\n\n\r\nPrismiera is a luxury jewelry brand with a short-form video series already producing cinematic content on YouTube — mythology, history, goddess archetypes, and Dark Academia aesthetics.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone to own the Instagram and TikTok side.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT repurposing YouTube content into different aspect ratios. This is building platform-native content that makes a woman feel powerful in under 20 seconds. You'll take assets from our YouTube production pipeline — AI-generated footage, voiceovers, atmospheric visuals — and reimagine them into aspirational, music-synced, scroll-stopping edits and cinematic skits designed for how Instagram and TikTok audiences actually consume.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe other half of this role: you'll be working with our AI-generated personas who serve as the visual anchor across our short-form content. You'll composite, integrate, and stylize AI-generated character visuals into edits that feel striking and intentional, not gimmicky. If the idea of building a visual identity around an AI persona excites you, keep reading!\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Style\n\r\n\n\r\nThe content mix you'll produce:\n\r\n\n\r\n65% VIBE & SCENARIO — The kind of reel a woman sends to her group chat with no caption because the vibe speaks for itself. \n\r\n\n\r\n25% CINEMATIC SKITS — High-end, visually stunning executions of viral formats and dark humor. The premise can be slightly unhinged or ironic, but the visuals never break luxury. Think high-end perfume commercial meets TikTok audio trend. The Goddess is never the butt of the joke — she's the punchline, and she always wins.\n\r\n\n\r\n10% SENSORY / EXPERIMENTAL — Layered, fast, loop-optimized. Visual overload with mythological texture. The algorithmic wildcard.\n\r\n\n\r\nYES: Aspirational. Lethal elegance. Fashion-edit energy. Dark femininity. Music-driven impact. Content that feels like a luxury car reel meets ancient mythology. Cinematic skits using our AI personas — high-production value, deadpan, surreal, or darkly ironic.\n\r\nNO: CapCut presets. Generic motivational quote reels. Low-effort vlog-style acting. Slapstick comedy. Anything that looks like it was made in Canva. Anything that cheapens a demi-luxury product.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Do\n\r\n\n\r\nRework & Reimagine: Take footage, AI-generated visuals, and audio from our YouTube production pipeline and build Instagram/TikTok-native edits. Same mythology, completely different content shape. You're not resizing — you're rebuilding with a different audience in mind.\n\r\n\n\r\nCinematic Skits: Build short-form skits around our AI personas that use trending formats, dark humor, or deadpan irony — executed at a visual level that never drops below luxury. People share it for the joke, follow the page for the aesthetic.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Persona Integration: Composite and stylize our AI-generated characters into edits and skits as a visual anchor. She's not a narrator in your content — she's the presence. The face the eye locks onto while mythology and music layers move around her.\n\r\n\n\r\nMusic-Sync Editing: Your cuts, transitions, and visual reveals are married to the beat. You understand rhythm as a storytelling tool. Swells, drops, silence, impact — all intentional.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlatform Instinct: You understand what Instagram rewards vs. what TikTok rewards. You know what gets saved on IG. You know what gets looped on TikTok. You design for those behaviors, not just for visual quality.\n\r\n\n\r\nInstagram Packaging: Beyond the Reel itself — you contribute to grid cohesion, caption strategy, and Story sequencing. The profile should make someone think \"I want to be part of this\" within 2 seconds of landing.\n\r\n\n\r\nVolume at Speed: Once your templates and aesthetic are locked, your turnaround per piece should be significantly faster than building from zero. We expect high output.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Requirements\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter Effects (Mandatory). Compositing, layering, motion graphics, light/shadow matching. This is your primary tool. You build visual experiences, not just cuts.\n\r\n\n\r\nPremiere Pro. For project handoffs and consistency with the rest of the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Aesthetic Eye. You instinctively know the difference between aspirational and try-hard. Between elegant and overproduced. Between powerful and loud. Your edits make people feel something before they consciously understand what they're looking at.\n\r\n\n\r\nMusic & Rhythm. You've made edits where the music drives the visuals — AMVs, fashion reels, phonk edits, fan edits, whatever. You understand pacing as a weapon. You know what \"the drop\" means and you know when NOT to use it.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Comfort. You'll be working with AI-generated visuals daily — both assets from our pipeline and tools we give you direct access to (Seedance 2.0, Seedream, and whatever launches next). You treat AI output as raw material to be refined, not finished product.\n\r\n\n\r\nLoop Thinking. You design edits that reward rewatching. The cut that lands on beat, the detail you only catch the second time, the seamless loop point. You think in circles, not lines.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong English. Daily async communication — clear, direct, professional.\n\r\n\n\r\nReliable & Coachable. You hit deadlines or warn early. You take direct feedback and iterate fast. You flag problems with options, not excuses.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Skills (Not Required, But We'll Notice)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Color grading — pushing AI output and mixed footage into a consistent luxury palette\n\r\n- Typography sense — text overlays that feel intentional and premium\n\r\n- Sound design — SFX layering beyond just music (risers, hits, atmospheric texture)\n\r\n- Carousel / static design for Instagram companion posts\n\r\n- Understanding of Instagram analytics — saves, shares, completion rates, and what drives them\n\r\n- Experience building visual identities for brands or personas on social media\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWeekly Output\n\r\n\n\r\nRamp-up (first 2–3 weeks): 3–5 reworks as you learn the brand aesthetic, lock your AE templates, and calibrate with the team.\n\r\nSteady state: 8–15 reworks per week across Instagram and TikTok. Individual rework turnaround target: 1–3 hours once templates are established.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHow This Role Fits\n\r\n\n\r\nOther editors handle cinematic YouTube production and visual effects — you own social media. Same mythology, same brand, different platform behavior. Each editor has a distinct lane, and yours is how Prismiera looks and feels on Instagram and TikTok.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nSystem Requirements\n\r\n\n\r\nRAM: 16GB minimum (32GB preferred) + SSD\n\r\nReliable high-speed internet (upload speed matters)\n\r\nMust run After Effects, Premiere Pro, and browser-based AI tools simultaneously\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nPaid Trial (Shortlisted Candidates)\n\r\n\n\r\nBefore any full-time commitment, we run a weekly paid trial. We provide real assets from our production pipeline, style references, and the AI persona visuals. You deliver reworks. Trial is compensated at $250 USD at the end of each week. If it's a mutual fit after 30 days, we transition to regular bi-weekly payments (before work).\n\r\n\n\r\nThis protects both sides — you see whether the work fits your strengths, we see whether the output fits our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n- Paid accounts for all frontier AI tools — Seedance 2.0, Seedream, and whatever launches next\n\r\n- Creative ownership — you're defining how a luxury brand looks and feels on Instagram and TikTok from day one\n\r\n- An AI persona to build around — not a hypothetical, an active visual identity you'll shape and evolve\n\r\n- A role that evolves as the tools evolve — this job will look different in six months, and that's the point\n\r\n- Clear briefs — asset libraries, mood references, and specific direction for every batch\n\r\n- Direct feedback — specific, constructive notes on every edit\n\r\n- A brand worth building — Prismiera launches soon. A second AI-native brand is incubating behind it. You're not joining a finished machine. You're helping build one.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n\n\r\n$1,100 USD/month. Paid trial at $250 USD/week, transitioning to bi-weekly payments of $550 (before work) after 30 days.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nOwnership & Confidentiality\n\r\n\n\r\nAll outputs (edits, project files, prompts, generated assets, persona visuals) are Prismiera property and must remain confidential.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a generic cover letter.\n\r\nUse 7 apply points or more when applying.\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: PRISMIERA SOCIAL — [Your Name]\n\r\n\n\r\nSend the following (in this order):\n\r\n\n\r\n1. The Vibe Test. Link to ONE edit you've made that is aspirational, aesthetic, or fashion-adjacent — or a skit that demonstrates platform-native virality instinct. Format doesn't matter. The feeling does.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. The Rhythm Test. Link to ONE edit where the music drives the visuals. Show us your beat-sync instinct. (Can overlap with #1 if one video demonstrates both.)\n\r\n\n\r\n3. The Creative Instinct Test (3–5 sentences total). You're given a 45-second cinematic video about a queen who poisoned her entire court, a folder of our AI Goddess visuals, and a dark atmospheric beat. Pitch two reworks: (A) a 15-second Instagram Reel designed to get saved — tell us your audio choice, pacing, and what the first 2 seconds look like; and (B) a 15-second cinematic skit that uses dark or deadpan humor without losing the luxury feel.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. AI Experience (1–2 sentences). What is your experience level with generative AI tools? If none, say so — we'll evaluate the rest on its own merits.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Hardware. Your PC specs: CPU / GPU / RAM. Plus your internet upload speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Turnaround Estimate. Given existing footage, a music track, and an established AE template — how long would a 15–20 second rework take you?\n\r\n\n\r\n7. The Rewrite. Rewrite this sentence to sound dark, powerful, and aspirational: \"She is really cool and strong and she wins.\"                ",
