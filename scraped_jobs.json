This is the quality, pacing, and storytelling level I expect:\n\r\n? \n\r\n? \n\r\n? \n\r\n? \n/channel/UCSD1CZO5lg5O4FNBmbi15Mw\n\r\nKey style elements:\n\r\n\n\r\nDocumentary / educational storytelling\n\r\nStrong hooks in the first 30 seconds\n\r\nAI-generated visuals blended with stock footage\n\r\nProfessional sound design (music + ambient effects)\n\r\nClean, cinematic editing — no flashy transitions, no \n edits\n\r\nStructured narrative that keeps viewers watching\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you watch those channels and think \"I can do this\" — keep reading.\n\r\nIf you watch them and feel lost — this isn't for you. No hard feelings.\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWHO YOU ARE (must-haves)\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\n You have real experience with AI video generation tools (Veo3, Runway, Kling, Pika, or similar)\n\r\n You can write effective AI prompts that produce cinematic, consistent results\n\r\n You understand narrative structure — you know how to pace a 20-minute story\n\r\n You can edit 10+ minute long-form videos (not TikToks, not Reels — real YouTube content)\n\r\n You use music and sound effects strategically, not randomly\n\r\n You work independently — I send you a script, you deliver a finished video\n\r\n You suggest creative improvements instead of just following instructions blindly\n\r\n NOT a fit if:\n\r\n? You've never used AI video tools (this is not a training position)\n\r\n? You only do short-form content (under 5 minutes)\n\r\n? You need step-by-step instructions for every single scene\n\r\n? You can't handle feedback or revisions\n\r\n? You disappear for days without communication\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWHAT YOU GET\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\n Pay: Starting at $400/month\n\r\n? If your quality is consistently high, salary increases. This is not a ceiling, it's a starting point.\n\r\n? Top performer can realistically reach $\n/month within 3-6 months.\n\r\n Volume: 60 videos/month (15/week)\n\r\n Location: Remote, any timezone (but deadlines are deadlines)\n\r\n Growth: I'm scaling to more channels. Good work = more work = more pay.\n\r\n Start: This week if you're ready\n\r\n Bonus: This is a long-term position. I'm not looking for a one-month freelancer. I want someone who grows with the channels.\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY (read this carefully — seriously)\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nDO NOT send a generic \"I'm interested\" message.\n\r\nI get hundreds of those. They all go straight to trash.\n\r\nInstead, do this:\n\r\n Write the word \"GLACIER\" at the very top of your message.\n\r\n? This proves you actually read the whole post. No GLACIER = I won't read your application.\n\r\n Send me at least one longer video (8+ minutes) that YOU personally edited.\n\r\n? Bonus points if it uses AI-generated visuals.\n\r\n? If you don't have a long-form sample, don't apply.\n\r\n Briefly explain:\n\r\n? What software do you use for editing?\n\r\n? What's your experience with AI video tools? (Which ones? How long?)\n\r\n? How do you approach structuring a long-form video from a script?\n\r\n Watch one of the reference channels above and tell me:\n\r\n? What do they do well?\n\r\n? What would you do differently?\n\r\n Applications without \"GLACIER\" at the top = automatically ignored. No exceptions.\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWHY WORK WITH ME?\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nHonest truth:\n\r\n I pay on time, every month. No chasing, no excuses.\n\r\n I give clear, specific feedback — not vague \"make it better\" nonsense.\n\r\n Steady, consistent work — not a random one-off project.\n\r\n I handle all the scripting — you focus purely on the visual/editing side.\n\r\n Room to grow as channels scale.\n\r\n I'm picky about quality. If pacing is off, I'll ask for revisions.\n\r\n Volume is real — 60 videos/month means you need to be efficient.\n\r\n I expect communication — if something is delayed, tell me before the deadline, not after.\n\r\nIf you understand structure, pacing, AI tools, and storytelling — we can build something long-term together.\n\r\nIf this sounds like you, apply now.\n\r\nIf not, no hard feelings — save us both the time.\n\r\nGeorge                ",

    "description": "\n                    ABOUT THIS ROLE\n\r\nWe are looking for an experienced Instagram social media marketer who understands Christian faith-based content, grief and healing topics, and funnel-driven Instagram strategy. This is a long-term part-time remote position supporting a growing digital healing community for women who have experienced pregnancy and infant loss.\n\r\nThis role is not for a general social media VA. We need someone who genuinely understands the emotional sensitivity required to market to grieving women, the nuances of Christian faith-integrated content, and the specific Instagram strategies that drive quiz completions and funnel conversions.\n\r\nIf you are a strong content scheduler who does not understand funnel strategy and conversion-focused content — this role is not the right fit.\n\r\nIf you understand how Instagram content drives lead generation, how ManyChat automation works alongside organic content, and how to speak to a deeply vulnerable audience with warmth and precision — we want to hear from you.\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT THE BUSINESS\n\r\nPam Vredevelt is a Licensed Professional Counselor with 40 years of clinical experience, a bestselling author whose book Empty Arms has sold over 200,000 copies, and the author of Mending Miracles — a number one bestseller endorsed by celebrated author Anne Patchett.\n\r\nPam and her daughter Jessie co-lead a digital healing community — the Healing Path Community — for women healing from miscarriage, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, SIDS, and infant loss. The business includes a quiz-based lead generation funnel, personalized healing guides, a professional online course, and a monthly membership community with live\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR\n\r\nYou are the right person for this role if all of the following are true.\n\r\nYou have at least two years of experience managing Instagram accounts for Christian, faith-based, wellness, or grief-related businesses.\n\r\nYou have experience creating or scheduling content that drives a specific action — quiz completions, link in bio clicks, DM responses, or funnel entries — not just likes and follows.\n\r\nYou understand ManyChat or are willing to learn it immediately. Our entire Instagram lead capture system runs through ManyChat and you will be responsible for monitoring its performance and flagging issues.\n\r\nYou are personally comfortable with Christian faith content. You do not need to share Pam’s faith but you must be able to write and schedule content that integrates scripture, prayer, and Biblical wisdom naturally and respectfully.\n\r\nYou understand grief. You have either personal or professional experience with loss and you understand instinctively why certain words, images, and tones are inappropriate for this audience. You will never post content that feels rushed, toxic-positive, or dismissive of grief.\n\r\nYou communicate proactively. You send updates without being asked. You flag concerns before they become problems. You ask for clarification before interpreting independently.\n\r\nYou are detail-oriented. Every caption, every hashtag, every posting time, every ManyChat keyword matters in a conversion-focused Instagram strategy. Careless execution is not acceptable in this role.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU WILL DO\n\r\nContent Scheduling and Publishing\n\r\nSchedule and publish three to four Instagram posts weekly across feed, Reels, and Stories using a content calendar provided and approved by Pam.\n\r\nAll captions are written by Pam or provided in copy documents. Your role is formatting, hashtag optimization, scheduling at optimal times, and confirming publication.\n\r\nFor Reels — download provided video files, add captions burned into video using CapCut or similar tool, format to correct dimensions, and schedule using Meta Business Suite or Later.\n\r\nFor Stories — design story cards in Canva using provided brand templates and copy, add link stickers pointing to quiz or relevant funnel pages, and publish on correct schedule.\n\r\nFor feed posts — format provided images or graphics to correct dimensions, apply provided captions with hashtags, and schedule at optimal posting times based on account analytics.\n\r\nManyChat Monitoring and Management\n\r\nMonitor ManyChat daily for any flow errors, broken triggers, or failed message deliveries.\n\r\nRespond to flagged conversations requiring personal response — specifically the I Have A Question trigger — within two hours by notifying Pam immediately.\n\r\nTrack keyword trigger performance weekly — how many people triggered each keyword, how many received the quiz link, how many clicked through. Report in weekly analytics summary.\n\r\nUpdate ManyChat keyword lists when new campaign keywords are introduced.\n\r\nHashtag Research and Optimization\n\r\nMaintain a master hashtag library of 150 to 200 researched hashtags organized by category.\n\r\nCategories include pregnancy loss, miscarriage, stillbirth, infant loss, Christian grief, healing journey, faith and healing, women’s wellness, Christian women, grief support, and baby loss awareness.\n\r\nRotate hashtag sets across posts to avoid repetition penalties from the Instagram algorithm. No post uses the exact same hashtag set as the previous post in the same category.\n\r\nResearch and add minimum five new relevant hashtags monthly based on trending content in the grief and Christian wellness space.\n\r\nAnalytics and Reporting\n\r\nEvery Monday morning send a one-page weekly analytics report covering the following metrics for the previous week.\n\r\nTop performing post by reach\n\r\nTop performing post by saves\n\r\nTop performing post by shares\n\r\nStories average reach and link sticker click rate\n\r\nReels average view rate at three seconds and fifteen seconds\n\r\nProfile visits\n\r\nBio link clicks\n\r\nManyChat keyword trigger volume\n\r\nQuiz entries attributed to Instagram traffic — tracked via UTM parameters\n\r\nNet follower change\n\r\nFlag immediately any metric that is significantly below the previous week’s baseline. Do not wait for Monday’s report if something is broken.\n\r\nContent Calendar Management\n\r\nMaintain a shared content calendar in Google Sheets or Trello updated at least one week in advance at all times.\n\r\nCalendar shows post date, post type, copy status, design status, approval status, and published confirmation for every piece of content.\n\r\nFlag any content gaps — days without scheduled content — at least five days in advance so Pam has time to provide new copy or repurpose existing content.\n\r\nCampaign Coordination\n\r\nWhen Pam launches a campaign — journal review request, membership open enrollment, podcast episode release, book promotion — coordinate the Instagram campaign elements across feed, Reels, and Stories according to the campaign deployment schedule provided.\n\r\nEnsure all campaign content is scheduled correctly, all link stickers point to correct destinations, and all ManyChat keywords relevant to the campaign are active and tested before campaign launch date.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU WILL NOT DO\n\r\nYou will not write original copy from scratch without Pam’s input. All messaging decisions belong to Pam. You may suggest copy adjustments for formatting or character limits but you do not change the meaning or tone of any content independently.\n\r\nYou will not post anything that has not been approved by Pam. Every piece of content — feed post, Reel, Story card — requires Pam’s approval before publishing. Build your workflow around this requirement.\n\r\nYou will not engage in comment conversations on behalf of Pam without explicit written guidelines for how to respond. When in doubt, flag for Pam rather than responding independently.\n\r\nYou will not make strategic decisions about content direction, campaign timing, or audience targeting without Pam’s input. Your role is expert execution of defined strategy — not strategy creation.\n\r\n\n\r\nTOOLS YOU MUST KNOW\n\r\nRequired — prior experience essential:\n\r\nMeta Business Suite — scheduling and analytics\n\r\nCanva — story card and graphic design using provided brand templates\n\r\nManyChat — flow monitoring and keyword management\n\r\nGoogle Sheets or similar — content calendar management\n\r\nCapCut or similar — Reel caption burning and basic video formatting\n\r\nRequired — willing to learn immediately if not already familiar:\n\r\nLater or Planoly — alternative scheduling tool if preferred\n\r\nUTM parameter tracking — basic understanding of how to add UTM parameters to links for traffic attribution\n\r\nMeta Ads Manager — basic familiarity for coordinating organic content alongside paid ad campaigns\n\r\n\n\r\nCHRISTIAN CONTENT REQUIREMENTS\n\r\nThis is a faith-integrated business. Christian content is not a peripheral element — it is central to who Pam is and who her audience is. You must be able to work confidently with the following content types.\n\r\nScripture graphics — formatting and scheduling posts that feature Biblical verses relevant to grief and healing\n\r\nPrayer prompts — posts that invite the audience into prayer or reflection\n\r\nFaith and neuroscience content — posts that bridge clinical healing science with Biblical wisdom\n\r\nTestimony content — posts that share transformation stories through a faith lens\n\r\nHoliday and liturgical calendar awareness — understanding which Christian holidays and observances are relevant to your posting schedule. Mother’s Day, Christmas, Easter, and Advent are particularly significant for a pregnancy loss audience and require thoughtful content planning in advance.\n\r\nIf you are uncomfortable with any of these content types please do not apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nSCHEDULE AND AVAILABILITY\n\r\nThis is a part-time role requiring approximately fifteen to twenty hours per week.\n\r\nYou must be available for a weekly thirty-minute check-in call with Pam at a mutually agreed time. Calls are held via Zoom.\n\r\nYou must be reachable by\n or messaging app within four hours during your working hours Monday through Friday.\n\r\nUrgent flags — ManyChat failures, broken links, campaign errors — require response within two hours regardless of day.\n\r\nTime zone flexibility is required. Pam is based in Central time USA. You do not need to work Central hours but you must have sufficient overlap for weekly calls and prompt communication.\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION\n\r\nThis is a negotiable monthly retainer based on experience and demonstrated results.\n\r\nExpected range: $400 to $800 USD per month for fifteen to twenty hours weekly.\n\r\nCandidates with documented experience driving Instagram lead generation and funnel conversions for Christian or faith-based businesses will be considered at the higher end of this range.\n\r\nCandidates whose experience is primarily content scheduling without conversion focus will be considered at the entry level of this range with performance review at ninety days.\n\r\nThis role has growth potential. As the Healing Path Community scales and paid ad campaigns launch alongside organic content, the scope and compensation of this role will grow with demonstrated results.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nPlease answer all five questions below. Applications that do not address all five questions will not be reviewed. We are looking for someone who reads carefully and communicates specifically — your application is the first demonstration of both.\n\r\nQuestion One\n\r\nDescribe one Instagram account you have managed for a Christian, faith-based, grief, or healing-related business. What was the account about, what was your specific role, and what measurable result did your work contribute to?\n\r\nQuestion Two\n\r\nHave you worked with ManyChat before? If yes describe one specific flow you built or managed and what it was designed to do. If no describe your experience with Instagram automation tools and your willingness to learn ManyChat before starting.\n\r\nQuestion Three\n\r\nThis role serves women who have experienced miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant loss. Describe in two to three sentences how you would approach creating and scheduling content for this specific audience. What would you never do and why?\n\r\nQuestion Four\n\r\nDescribe your experience with conversion-focused Instagram content — content designed to drive a specific action like a link click, DM response, or quiz completion. Give one specific example.\n\r\nQuestion Five\n\r\nWhat is your proposed monthly retainer for fifteen to twenty hours per week and what tools do you currently use for content scheduling and analytics?\n\r\n\n\r\nONE FINAL NOTE\n\r\nThis role requires someone who genuinely cares about the women this business serves. Behind every Instagram impression is a grieving mother searching for something that understands her pain. The content you schedule and the ManyChat flows you monitor are the first point of contact between her and a resource that could genuinely change her healing journey.\n\r\nWe do not take that lightly. We hope you won’t either.\n\r\nIf this resonates with who you are and how you work — we look forward to hearing from you.\n\r\nPam Vredevelt Team\n\r\n\n                ",

    "description": "\n                    HEY \n\r\nI run multiple YouTube channels focused on history, military stories, and educational content. Long-form videos, 15-25 minutes each. Documentary style with AI-generated visuals.\n\r\nI need someone who can take my scripts and turn them into finished, cinematic YouTube videos using AI video tools — primarily Google Veo3 (or similar tools like Runway, Kling, etc.)\n\r\nI handle all scripting. You handle everything else: AI video generation, editing, pacing, music, sound design, and final delivery.\n\r\nThis is NOT traditional video editing. You won't be cutting raw camera footage. You'll be creating visuals from scratch using AI prompts, then assembling them into a polished, cinematic video.\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL ACTUALLY DO (real talk)\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nYour typical week:\n\r\n? You receive 15 scripts with visual instructions fro\n\r\n? For each script, you generate AI video clips using Veo3 (or similar tools)\n\r\n? You edit everything together: AI clips + stock footage + music + sound effects\n\r\n? You maintain consistent pacing, narrative structure, and cinematic feel\n\r\n? You deliver 15 finished videos per week (60/month total)\n\r\nEach video is 15-25 minutes long, documentary/storytelling style.\n\r\nTools you'll use:\n\r\n\n\r\nGoogle Veo3 (primary AI video generation — I provide access)\n\r\nCapCut, Premiere Pro, or DaVinci Resolve (editing)\n\r\nStock footage sources (Pexels, Pixabay — I'll guide you)\n\r\nGoogle Drive / Dropbox (file sharing)\n\r\nSlack or\n (communication)\n\r\n\n\r\nOutput expected:\n\r\n\n\r\n60 finished videos per month (15/week)\n\r\nConsistent quality across all videos\n\r\nEach video ready to upload — no additional editing needed fro\n\r\n\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nSTYLE REFERENCE — THIS IS WHAT YOUR WORK SHOULD LOOK LIKE\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWatch these channels carefully. This is the quality, pacing, and storytelling level I expect:\n\r\n? \n\r\n? \n\r\n? \n\r\n? \n/channel/UCSD1CZO5lg5O4FNBmbi15Mw\n\r\nKey style elements:\n\r\n\n\r\nDocumentary / educational storytelling\n\r\nStrong hooks in the first 30 seconds\n\r\nAI-generated visuals blended with stock footage\n\r\nProfessional sound design (music + ambient effects)\n\r\nClean, cinematic editing — no flashy transitions, no \n edits\n\r\nStructured narrative that keeps viewers watching\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you watch those channels and think \"I can do this\" — keep reading.\n\r\nIf you watch them and feel lost — this isn't for you. No hard feelings.\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWHO YOU ARE (must-haves)\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\n You have real experience with AI video generation tools (Veo3, Runway, Kling, Pika, or similar)\n\r\n You can write effective AI prompts that produce cinematic, consistent results\n\r\n You understand narrative structure — you know how to pace a 20-minute story\n\r\n You can edit 10+ minute long-form videos (not TikToks, not Reels — real YouTube content)\n\r\n You use music and sound effects strategically, not randomly\n\r\n You work independently — I send you a script, you deliver a finished video\n\r\n You suggest creative improvements instead of just following instructions blindly\n\r\n NOT a fit if:\n\r\n? You've never used AI video tools (this is not a training position)\n\r\n? You only do short-form content (under 5 minutes)\n\r\n? You need step-by-step instructions for every single scene\n\r\n? You can't handle feedback or revisions\n\r\n? You disappear for days without communication\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWHAT YOU GET\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\n Pay: Starting at $400/month\n\r\n? If your quality is consistently high, salary increases. This is not a ceiling, it's a starting point.\n\r\n? Top performer can realistically reach $\n/month within 3-6 months.\n\r\n Volume: 60 videos/month (15/week)\n\r\n Location: Remote, any timezone (but deadlines are deadlines)\n\r\n Growth: I'm scaling to more channels. Good work = more work = more pay.\n\r\n Start: This week if you're ready\n\r\n Bonus: This is a long-term position. I'm not looking for a one-month freelancer. I want someone who grows with the channels.\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY (read this carefully — seriously)\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nDO NOT send a generic \"I'm interested\" message.\n\r\nI get hundreds of those. They all go straight to trash.\n\r\nInstead, do this:\n\r\n Write the word \"GLACIER\" at the very top of your message.\n\r\n? This proves you actually read the whole post. No GLACIER = I won't read your application.\n\r\n Send me at least one longer video (8+ minutes) that YOU personally edited.\n\r\n? Bonus points if it uses AI-generated visuals.\n\r\n? If you don't have a long-form sample, don't apply.\n\r\n Briefly explain:\n\r\n? What software do you use for editing?\n\r\n? What's your experience with AI video tools? (Which ones? How long?)\n\r\n? How do you approach structuring a long-form video from a script?\n\r\n Watch one of the reference channels above and tell me:\n\r\n? What do they do well?\n\r\n? What would you do differently?\n\r\n Applications without \"GLACIER\" at the top = automatically ignored. No exceptions.\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWHY WORK WITH ME?\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nHonest truth:\n\r\n I pay on time, every month. No chasing, no excuses.\n\r\n I give clear, specific feedback — not vague \"make it better\" nonsense.\n\r\n Steady, consistent work — not a random one-off project.\n\r\n I handle all the scripting — you focus purely on the visual/editing side.\n\r\n Room to grow as channels scale.\n\r\n I'm picky about quality. If pacing is off, I'll ask for revisions.\n\r\n Volume is real — 60 videos/month means you need to be efficient.\n\r\n I expect communication — if something is delayed, tell me before the deadline, not after.\n\r\nIf you understand structure, pacing, AI tools, and storytelling — we can build something long-term together.\n\r\nIf this sounds like you, apply now.\n\r\nIf not, no hard feelings — save us both the time.

We are an SEO-first agency and rely heavily on organic traffic for our B2B leads. We are looking for a Technical SEO & AI Search Specialist to join our team.\n\r\n\n\r\n?? READ CAREFULLY: We need a Code-Level Technical Expert, not a Content Writer or Generalist.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe work with a specific stack: Webflow + Weglot (International SEO). You must understand how they interact technically (Canonicals, Hreflang, Sitemaps).\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR RESPONSIBILITIES:\n\r\n• Monitor Ahrefs Site Health and fix technical errors (Redirects, 404s, Canonicals).\n\r\n• Create and implement custom JSON-LD Schema Markup (using \n method, nesting Product/Service correctly).\n\r\n• Implement GEO Strategies: Optimize our content and technical structure for AI Search Engines (ChatGPT Search, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity).\n\r\n• Manage International SEO tags for our languages (DE, EN, FR, IT).\n\r\n• Optimize technical performance (Core Web Vitals) in Webflow.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\r\n1.

Applications without these answers will be ignored.\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Question: A Webflow site uses Weglot. Google Search Console shows an \"Unsupported File Format\" error for the sitemap. You check the browser, and the sitemap looks fine (text is there). What is the likely technical error in the HTTP Header?\n\r\n2. Question: We want to validly use \"aggregateRating\" (Stars) and \"audience\" properties in the same Schema block. \n structure do you recommend to avoid validation errors?\n\r\n3. Personality: What is your favorite tool for debugging HTTP headers and why?\n\r\n\n\r\nWe offer a stable long-term position and treat our team with respect.

We will give you a list of creators who attended each and you will find their TikTok handles.\n\nCreating creator campaigns on Growi and inputting creators’ Tiktok handles\n\nUsing a creator tracking software called Growi, you will create a separate campaign for each coaching Call. Then, you’ll add each creator who joined the respective call to the campaign using their handle you found earlier.\n\nSorting through Discord server members to identify top-performing TikTok Shop creators\n\nIn all of our brand’s Discord servers, we implement a ticket system that allows us to maintain 1 on 1 communication with all the top creators. \n\nYou will sort through all the members who join the Discord, find out their TikTok handle, and check their L30 day gmv on the TikTok Affiliate Center.\n\nThis is vital because it allows us to communicate with as many high potential creators as possible and maximize the number of videos they post.\n\nReaching out to creators to be a part of 7-day posting cohorts\n\nWe host 7 day posting cohorts where we take a group of 5 creators with potential to generate sales, put them in a group chat, and provide one video every day for them to replicate.\n\nYou will be in charge of identifying creators to be a part of these posting cohorts. Once you identify top performing TT Shop creators, you’re going to message them privately, asking if they want to be a part of the cohort.\n\nHandling additional weekly tasks that are assigned\n\nTurn new priorities from meetings, Slack, and ad?hoc requests into completed tasks with clear owners, deadlines, and visible progress. Ensure nothing falls through the cracks. \n\nDaily execution of team & administrative tasks\n\nIn addition to coaching the creators and maintaining these relationships, you will have a minimal amount of administrative tasks.\n\nDaily Check-Ins:\n\nProvide updates on what tasks you’ve been working on that day.\n\nReport findings of what’s working and what isn’t.\n\nShare ideas for improving client success.\n\nEnd of Day Report\n\nAt the end of each work day, you will be expected to complete a form outlining everything you completed for that day.\n\nWeekly Team Meeting\n\nAttend team check-in meeting via Google Meet every week.\n\n\n\nCompetencies:\n\nProficient in English \n\nPart of your job will require you to outreach hundreds of creators. You must be able to write clear, friendly DMs and hold a proper conversation with creators as needed. \n\nCommunication and responsiveness\n\nYou are active on Slack and respond to messages timely.\n\nHigh ownership and bias to action\n\nYou don’t wait for instructions on what to complete each day. You take action relentlessly and own the operations you’re in charge of.\n\nWhenever there’s a new batch of creators that join a brand’s Discord, you immediately begin looking them up on TikTok without me reminding you to.\n\nEvery week, there will be new tasks to handle. Upon hearing them, you will immediately spring to action and complete them as soon as possible.\n\nDisciplined\n\nA majority of your job will be manual work, but you’ll manage it at the highest quality. \n\nYou follow instructions exactly, document what you’ve completed every day, and don’t skip steps.\n\nOrganized\n\nYou will be in charge of tracking hundreds or even thousands of creators. You’re on top of all the work you’re completing, ensuring that you have the proper systems in place to deliver the highest quality possible. \n\nTikTok Shop Experience\n\nYou have experience operating within TikTok Shop Seller Center, Tiktok Shop Affiliate Center, and using tools like Growi. \n\nYou have a deep understanding of how to navigate through these platforms and look up creators usernames to find their L30 Day GMV.\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Assistant Position Description:\n\nTime\n\nYou will have the freedom to make your own schedule. That said, it is crucial that you have access to the necessary tools (Slack) to handle replies during work hours\n\nYou will be expected to complete your end of day tasks every day Monday-Friday.\n\nYou will also be expected to be online M-F from 8am - 5pm EST: replying to creator messages and communicating through slack.\n\nThis position is remote, so you will have the freedom to work from anywhere. Please ensure that you have a strong connection and there are minimal distractions when on calls with clients.\n\nCompensation\n\n$1000/mo full time\n\nPotential for added bonuses depending on performance\n\n\n\nPlease film a 5 minute max loom explaining:\n\n1. Previous experience you've had with TikTok Shop - brands you've worked with, results you've driven, etc. Only people with TikTok Shop experience will be considered.\n\n2. Why you are a good fit for the position.\n\n3. How to find a creators' last 30 day gmv generated. Share your screen and show yourself walking through this.                ",

    "description": "\n                    The Mission\n\r\nWe are looking for a Historical Story Hunter. This is not a typical virtual assistant role; it is a mission to dig through the \"vaults\" of time and unearth the strange, the tragic, and the unexplained. We are building a massive digital library of forgotten history, and we need a hunter who can track down original newspaper clippings from the 1800s and 1900s.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be responsible for stocking our \"Content Bucket\" months in advance. Your work will provide the raw, authentic evidence that makes history come alive for our global audience.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Daily Hunt\n\r\nYour focus is volume, discovery, and organization. Your goal is to find 5–10 high-quality stories every day to fill our comprehensive library across US, UK, and Australian archives.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be hunting across these genres:\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Unexplained: Strange Sightings, Ancient/Forbidden Technology, Mass Panic/Hysteria.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Tragic: Disasters & Catastrophes, Emotional/Aviation A\n, Lost Expeditions.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Mysterious: Maritime Mysteries, Unsolved Disappearances, Crimes & Scandals.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Odd: Newspaper Oddities (strange 19th-century reports) and Australian Bushranger stories.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Calendar: Building an \"On This Day\" Library that covers every day of the year.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Hunter’s Toolkit (Daily Tasks)\n\r\nSearch the Archives: Use global digital vaults to find stories from a provided lead list.\n\r\n\n\r\nCapture the Evidence: \n\r\nSave the full newspaper page (high-res PDF/Image).\n\r\nCapture 5 targeted screenshots (The headline, the key paragraphs, the byline, and any sketches/photos).\n\r\nDocument the Facts: Create a simple text file for every story including: Publication Name, Date, Full Headline, Source URL, and a 1–3 sentence factual summary (Quite often a copy paste of data already on the page).\n\r\nOrganize the Vault: File everything into a structured Google Drive \"Bucket\" categorized by decade and theme for easy retrieval months later.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Selection Challenge: Prove You’re a Hunter\n\r\nWe don’t want a resume; we want proof of your hunting skills. Please complete these four short tasks (Total time: ~15 minutes). Simply provide the screenshots and answers requested in your application.\n\r\n\n\r\nTask 1: The End of an Outlaw (Trove - Australia)\n\r\nThe Source: \n\r\nThe Goal: Open this report on the execution of the bushranger Ned Kelly.\n\r\nWhat to send: A screenshot of the article. In your reply, tell me what his very last words were according to this specific report.\n\r\n\n\r\nTask 2: The Capture at Glenrowan (Trove - Australia)\n\r\nThe Source: \n\r\nThe Goal: Find the original news of Ned Kelly’s capture (the siege at Glenrowan), not his execution.\n\r\nSearch Tip: Focus your search on late June or early July 1880.\n\r\nWhat to send: A screenshot of a report from that week (June 28 – July 5, 1880) showing the newspaper name and date.\n\r\n\n\r\nTask 3: The Mary Celeste Mystery (Chronicling America - USA)\n\r\nThe Source: \n\r\nThe Goal: Find a report on the \"Ghost Ship\" Mary Celeste published between December 1872 and June 1873.\n\r\nSearch Tip: Look for a detailed report from late February or early March 1873.\n\r\nWhat to send: A screenshot of the newspaper scan showing the mention of the ship and the date.\n\r\n\n\r\nTask 4: Your Instincts\n\r\nThe Goal: Based on the genre list in the \"Daily Hunt\" section above, tell me which genre of historical stories interests you the most and why?\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nPrecision: You can find exact dates and clean clippings.\n\r\nArchival Quality: Your screenshots are clear, straight, and professional.\n\r\nIndependence: You love the thrill of the hunt and don't need hand-holding.\n\r\nReliable Setup: Stable internet and a computer capable of handling high-res images/PDFs.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nReply with a summary of why you are interested in this job along with the screenshots/answers from Tasks 1–4. \n\r\n\n\r\nAll candidates will be considered, the taskings is for you to see if this is something you will enjoy doing and for me to see what kind of outputs you can produce. \n\r\n\n\r\nNo prior archive experience?

I work remotely from Thailand (GMT+7). I'm looking for a reliable, detail-oriented Virtual Assistant to work with me full-time and help me stay focused on high-impact engineering and product work.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll take ownership of QA testing, research, document management, and general personal admin — the things that need to get done but don't need to be done by me. Think of this as being the right hand to a senior engineer at a fast-moving tech company.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a great role if you're curious about technology, enjoy variety in your work, and want to grow your skills in a tech startup environment. You don't need to be a developer, but you should be comfortable navigating web apps, spreadsheets, and picking up new tools quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Your timezone advantage:** I'm based in Thailand (GMT+7), just 1 hour behind the Philippines.

What Success Looks Like\n\r\nAfter 60–90 days, success looks like:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can take a brief, reference examples, and footage and turn them into strong edits with minimal back?and?forth.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou consistently hit fast turnaround times (often 24–72 hours per project, depending on scope).\n\r\n\n\r\nYou perform well under pressure when multiple projects land at once, keeping communication clear and expectations realistic.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour hooks and story structures increase watch time and engagement on client content.\n\r\n\n\r\nAgents and builders start asking for you by name and referencing your previous edits as the standard.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Day?to?Day\n\r\nA typical week might include:\n\r\n\n\r\nReceiving several projects with clear deadlines and simple creative direction.\n\r\n\n\r\nReviewing footage, identifying the best visuals and sound bites, and mapping a short story arc for each edit.\n\r\n\n\r\nWriting or refining hooks, on?screen text, and CTA frames that feel natural for real estate.\n\r\n\n\r\nEditing for multiple aspect ratios, with an emphasis on vertical content.\n\r\n\n\r\nDelivering final files, plus occasionally alternate versions (shorter cut, different hook, text/no text).\n\r\n\n\r\nHandling last?minute or rush edits when a client needs something turned around quickly (e.g., before a listing goes live).\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Requirements\n\r\nMust?haves\n\r\nProven track record editing short?form video (Reels, TikTok, Shorts) with a portfolio or reel.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience crafting story ideas, hooks, and structures that keep people watching, not just cutting clips together.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbility to work quickly and accurately, with short turnaround times and firm deadlines.\n\r\n\n\r\nDemonstrated ability to stay calm and professional under pressure.\n\r\n\n\r\nProficiency in a professional editing tool (Premiere Pro, Final Cut, or DaVinci Resolve).\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong sense of pacing, music, and visual flow.\n\r\n\n\r\nReliable internet and setup for fully remote work.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong communication skills and responsiveness in a remote environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nNice?to?haves\n\r\nExperience with real estate, architecture, or lifestyle content.\n\r\n\n\r\nBasic motion graphics skills (titles, callouts, simple transitions).\n\r\n\n\r\nFamiliarity with current trends and best practices for property content on social platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\n7. Who You Are\n\r\nYou might be a great fit if:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou think like a storyteller first and an editor second: you care about the hook, the arc, and the payoff.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou enjoy working fast and feel comfortable with deadlines and occasional last?minute requests.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re organized with your timelines, folders, and exports, even when juggling multiple projects.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou want your work to actually ship and be seen daily, not sit in drafts.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou like the idea of growing into more work (or full?time) as you prove reliability and quality.\n\r\n\n\r\n8. Role Logistics\n\r\nType: Open to both gig?based and full?time (we’re actively looking for people who can grow into more work).\n\r\n\n\r\nLocation: Fully remote.\n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule: Flexible, but you must be able to hit short turnaround times and communicate clearly about availability.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation: [Insert range / per?project / hourly details].\n\r\n\n\r\nReports to: [Founder / Creative Director].\n\r\n\n\r\n9. How to Apply\n\r\nPlease send:\n\r\n\n\r\nA short note about you and your experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nLinks to your portfolio or reel (ideally with short?form and, if possible, real estate or lifestyle examples).\n\r\n\n\r\n1–2 examples where you were involved from pre?production or hook/story concept through to final edit.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour typical turnaround window and preferred working arrangement (gig?based, part?time, or full?time track).\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can [include\n or form link] for submissions.

You will work closely with the clinic owner and an external UK-based virtual reception team, focusing on Dentally, data accuracy and keeping patients fully followed up. \n\r\n\n\r\nOpen to full time or part time. If part time, there needs to be room to expand into full time if workload requires it.\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a fully remote role (home-based) supporting a UK time zone, typically Monday–Friday (flexible on working hours as long as majority is within UK hours). You will not handle live phone calls; instead, you will be the \"engine room\" behind the scenes, managing Dentally, patient records, recalls and admin tasks so the clinical and reception teams can focus on patients.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role requires someone who can work proactively and independently in the background. You will need to be highly comfortable with data, CRM systems, and creating reports. A key part of your role is managing upwards – regularly communicating with clinicians and the reception team through clear reports and task lists, highlighting what needs attention and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\nDENTALLY & PATIENT DATA MANAGEMENT: \n\r\n\n\r\n- Log in to Dentally daily to review new patients and updates, checking that all new registrations are complete and accurate.\n\r\n- Check that new patient enquiries have been added correctly, have appointments booked, and have received their treatment plans and information.\n\r\n- Maintain excellent data hygiene: tidy records, consistent contact details, correct tags, accurate medical/dental history status (where provided by the clinic).\n\r\n- Create and
