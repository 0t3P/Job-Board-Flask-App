This is not a task-based automation role. It is a systems role focused on architecture, reliability, and long-term scalability.\n\r\nThis position is outsourced/contract-based, with the potential for ongoing work if the partnership proves successful.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Goal\n\r\nI’m looking to be able to run 99% of our business from the speaking capabilities of ChatGPT. When I talk to my phone I need it to be able to look up information about a project (airtable),\n that information (google workspace) and attach documents (google drive) to individuals in my contact list or database among other things.  The primary goal goes back to conversational instruction and interaction.  \n\r\nRole Overview\n\r\nYou will be responsible for architecting a fully integrated automation ecosystem that connects client intake, onboarding, project workflows, internal communication, and AI-assisted decision-making. The system will be orchestrated primarily through n8n, with Airtable, Google Workspace, and AI tools serving as core components.\n\r\nYou will work directly with leadership to translate business processes into durable, well-documented automation logic.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Be Responsible For\n\r\nDesigning end-to-end automation workflows that support sales, onboarding, and project execution\n\r\nTranslating real-world business processes into structured, state-based systems\n\r\nBuilding readable, maintainable, and debuggable n8n workflows\n\r\nImplementing AI thoughtfully and intentionally, with clear guardrails\n\r\nAnticipating failure points and designing error handling, logging, and recovery paths\n\r\nProducing clear documentation that allows systems to be maintained and extended\n\r\n\n\r\nHow and Why Someone Succeeds in This Role\n\r\nSuccess in this role requires the ability to move from ambiguity to structure. You will be working with evolving processes, multiple business lines, and real human constraints.\n\r\nYou will do well if you:\n\r\nThink in systems, states, and workflows\n\r\nCan clearly articulate why a solution is designed a certain way\n\r\nView automation as an evolving product, not a one-time build\n\r\nBalance technical rigor with business practicality\n\r\nAre comfortable designing for both scale and human intervention\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Traits\n\r\nStrong systems thinking and architectural judgment\n\r\nHigh attention to edge cases and failure scenarios\n\r\nClear, concise written communication\n\r\nComfort pushing back on poor assumptions with better alternatives\n\r\nMethodical problem-solving under real-world constraints\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Experience and Software Mastery\n\r\nCandidates must demonstrate real-world proficiency with the following:\n\r\nCore Stack\n\r\nn8n – workflow orchestration, branching logic, webhooks, error handling\n\r\nAirtable – relational data modeling, views as logic layers, record state management\n\r\nGoogle Workspace\n\r\nGoogle Docs for contracts, scopes, and generated documentation\n\r\nGoogle Sheets for structured data and logs\n\r\nGoogle Drive for automated folder and file creation\n\r\nGmail and Calendar for automated communication and scheduling\n\r\nAI Utilization (Intentional and Selective)\n\r\nChatGPT\n\r\nClient-facing conversational logic\n\r\nSummarization and structured output\n\r\nFront-end response generation\n\r\nGemini\n\r\nAdvanced reasoning and multi-step analysis\n\r\nComplex decision evaluation when deeper logic is required\n\r\nA strong candidate understands when not to use AI just as clearly as when to use it.\n\r\n\n\r\nCurrent Client Onboarding and Project Management Workflow (High-Level)\n\r\nThe system you will be designing supports the following lifecycle:\n\r\n1. Client Intake\n\r\nClient submits an intake form via website, referral, or agent\n\r\nData is normalized and stored in Airtable\n\r\nClient is assigned an initial status (Lead, Qualified, Onboarding)\n\r\n2. Qualification and Routing\n\r\nAI reviews intake data for project type, budget alignment, and timeline feasibility\n\r\nClient is routed to the appropriate service path:\n\r\nDesign-only\n\r\nDesign and construction\n\r\nReal estate support\n\r\nInternal stakeholders receive an AI-generated summary\n\r\n3. Automated Onboarding\n\r\nWelcome communication and next-step instructions are sent\n\r\nContracts are generated in Google Docs\n\r\nDeposits and key milestones are logged\n\r\nProject-specific folder structures are created in Google Drive\n\r\nProject status moves to Active\n\r\n4. Project Management Execution\n\r\nProjects progress through defined phases:\n\r\nDiscovery\n\r\nDesign\n\r\nSelections\n\r\nProcurement\n\r\nConstruction\n\r\nClose-out\n\r\nStatus changes trigger:\n\r\nInternal tasks\n\r\nClient updates\n\r\nDocument creation\n\r\nAI-generated summaries for handoffs\n\r\n5. Intelligence and Oversight Layer\n\r\nChatGPT is used for:\n\r\nClient-facing summaries\n\r\nMeeting recaps\n\r\nScope explanations\n\r\nGemini is used for:\n\r\nConflict detection\n\r\nTimeline and dependency risk analysis\n\r\nValidation of complex decisions\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication Requirement (Primary Evaluation Criteria)\n\r\nTo be considered, applicants must submit a one-page pitch that includes:\n\r\n1. Executive Summary\n\r\nYour approach to building this system\n\r\nYour philosophy on automation architecture\n\r\nHow you design for reliability and scale\n\r\n2. Workflow Diagram\n\r\nA clear visual diagram showing:\n\r\nTriggers and entry points\n\r\nData storage and state transitions\n\r\nn8n workflow structure\n\r\nAI decision points\n\r\nDiagram tools may include Figma, L\n Whimsical, Miro, or similar\n\r\n3. Risks and Concerns\n\r\nWhere complexity is most likely to arise\n\r\nWhat components are most fragile\n\r\nWhere human intervention is required\n\r\n4. Proposed Solutions\n\r\nError handling and recovery strategies\n\r\nLogging and monitoring approaches\n\r\nVersioning and extensibility considerations\n\r\nThis submission will be the primary basis for selection.

We build fast, iterate constantly, and rely heavily on AI to design tools, workflows, and internal systems that give us leverage.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re looking for a full-stack developer who is deeply comfortable using AI as a daily building partner — not just for code generation, but for thinking, iteration, and speed.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a “wait for specs, then build slowly” role. This is for someone who enjoys ambiguity, systems thinking, and shipping.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Work On\n\r\n-This role is a mix of web development and custom internal tools, including:\n\r\n-Website & Frontend Work\n\r\n-WordPress site builds (A–Z: structure, design, implementation)\n\r\n-High-quality, conversion-focused marketing sites\n\r\n-Rapid iteration using AI-assisted workflows\n\r\n-Occasional non-WordPress builds (Next.js / Node.js or other modern stacks when appropriate)\n\r\n\n\r\nCustom Tools & AI Systems\n\r\n-Internal AI tools (e.g. custom copywriting engines based on proprietary processes)\n\r\n-Client-facing portals (asset review, approvals, task visibility, ClickUp-synced workflows)\n\r\n-Lightweight internal dashboards and utilities\n\r\n-AI-driven automations and workflows\n\r\nWe care far more about speed, clarity, and leverage than over-engineering.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow We Work\n\r\n-Small team, very little bureaucracy\n\r\n-High trust, high responsibility\n\r\n-Heavy use of AI (ChatGPT, APIs, automation tools)\n\r\n-Build ? test ? iterate ? improve\n\r\nYou’ll often be given a goal, not a detailed spec\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you need perfectly defined requirements to start, this is not the role for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’re Looking For\n\r\nYou likely:\n\r\n-Are a full-stack developer comfortable across frontend + backend\n\r\n-Use AI daily to plan, write, debug, and iterate faster\n\r\n-Can build clean WordPress sites quickly and confidently\n\r\n-Are comfortable choosing tools pragmatically (not emotionally)\n\r\n-Think in systems, workflows, and modular components\n\r\n-Can explain your thinking clearly (not just ship code)\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Skills\n\r\n-Experience with automation tools (Zapier, Make, webhooks)\n\r\n-Familiarity with AI APIs (OpenAI, etc.)\n\r\n-Experience building internal tools or ops software\n\r\n-Product or systems design instincts\n\r\n\n\r\nTime & Compensation\n\r\n-Contract role to start\n\r\n-Project-based or part-time initially, $8-12/hr depending on experience and skills\n\r\n-Opportunity to scale hours and move toward full-time\n\r\n-Compensation based on experience and speed\n\r\nWe’re looking to start ASAP\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Exercise (How We Evaluate Fit)\n\r\nInstead of a traditional cover letter, we ask applicants to complete a short thinking exercise.\n\r\n\n\r\n*The Challenge*\n\r\nPlease outline how you would design and approach a system like the following:\n\r\n-A tool that takes structured inputs (project context, audience, constraints), generates copy using AI, runs that copy through multiple “AI reviewers” with different expert perspectives, scores and critiques each iteration, and automatically loops until a quality threshold is met—at which point it’s surfaced for human review and approval.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou do not need to write code.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn Your Response, Cover (High-Level):\n\r\nSystem Architecture:\n\r\n-How you’d break this into components\n\r\n-What you’d build first vs later\n\r\nAI Usage:\n\r\n-Prompt structure\n\r\n-Reviewer personas\n\r\n-Scoring + iteration logic\n\r\nTooling Choices:\n\r\n-What stack(s) you’d consider and why\n\r\n-Where you’d leverage existing tools vs custom code\n\r\nIteration & Control:\n\r\n-Preventing infinite loops or runaway costs\n\r\n-Human review and override points\n\r\nSpeed vs Quality:\n\r\n-What you’d keep simple in v1\n\r\n-Where you’d intentionally move fast\n\r\n\n\r\nBullet points are fine. Diagrams optional.\n\r\nThere is no “correct” answer — we care about how you think.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nPlease submit:\n\r\n-Your resume or portfolio (links welcome)\n\r\n-Your response to the exercise above\n\r\nIf it looks like a strong fit, we’ll move quickly.
