Video content is a core part of how we educate and support our community, particularly through YouTube.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Role:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re hiring a Video Editor who is excellent at execution and interested in growing into a broader YouTube role over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou do not need to have YouTube marketing or channel management experience yet.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat matters most is strong video editing fundamentals, and genuine interest in learning how YouTube channels are structured, optimized, and grown.\n\r\n\n\r\nEarly on, this role is execution-focused. Over time, there is a clear opportunity to grow into YouTube SEO and channel management responsibilities with training and guidance.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Be Responsible For:\n\r\nPhase 1: Video Editing (Primary Focus)\n\r\n- Editing real backlog videos using Adobe Premiere Pro\n\r\n- Maintaining consistent quality, pacing, and clarity\n\r\n- Creating and integrating AI-generated video elements where appropriate (e.g. avatar-led or explainer segments), using tools like HeyGen\n\r\n- Delivering edits reliably and iterating based on feedback\n\r\n- Working closely with the marketing and sales team to stay aligned with brand standards and performance goals\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 2: Growth Into YouTube Channel Work (Over Time)\n\r\n- Learning how videos are structured and organized on YouTube\n\r\n- Supporting playlist creation and basic channel organization\n\r\n\n\r\nGradually contributing to:\n\r\n- titles and descriptions\n\r\n- basic YouTube SEO fundamentals\n\r\n- channel consistency and hygiene\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be trained and supported as you grow into this side of the role.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Skills & Experience:\n\r\n- Strong proficiency in Adobe Premiere Pro (non-negotiable)\n\r\n- Solid video editing fundamentals (pacing, structure, storytelling)\n\r\n- Experience creating or working with AI-generated video content (HeyGen or similar tools)\n\r\n- Ability to work with pace and meet deadlines\n\r\n- Clear written and verbal communication\n\r\n- Openness to feedback and willingness to learn new skills\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have (Not Required):\n\r\n- Any exposure to YouTube content or channels\n\r\n- Curiosity about YouTube SEO, playlists, or channel structure\n\r\n- Interest in long-term ownership beyond editing\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you don’t have these yet but want to learn, that’s completely fine.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow We Evaluate Candidates:\n\r\n\n\r\nAs part of our hiring process, we use OnlineJobs.ph assessments to help us better understand how candidates think and work. These include:\n\r\n- IQ test\n\r\n- DISC behavioral assessment\n\r\n- Personality assessment\n\r\n\n\r\nThese tests are not about passing or failing. They help us assess learning style, communication preferences, and overall fit for the role and team.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe care far more about how you work and think than generic strategy documents or polished interview answers.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication Process:\n\r\nAs the first step, we’d like you to submit a short 3–5 minute video introduction. In your video, please answer the following:\n\r\n- Tell us about yourself and your background.\n\r\n- Why are you interested in working with Share Wealth Systems (Reference Share Wealth Systems on the video)?\n\r\n- Share a brief note on your experience with YouTube channels (editing, management, or both).\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease upload your video to Google Drive, Dropbox, or use Loom and send us the relevant link here along with your resume. We’re looking for clear communication and a genuine introduction.                ",

    "description": "\n                    *Please Read Thoroughly* Thank you!\n\r\n\n\r\nLocation: Remote\n\r\nMust be available for Hours: ,\n\r\n8:00 AM – 12PM Pacific Time (Seattle)\n\r\n8:00pm - 10PM Pacific Time (Seattle)\n\r\nAdditional Projects can be worked outside of these time sets \n\r\n\n\r\nOverview\n\r\nWe are seeking a Virtual Executive Assistant to assist me directly with my day-to-day business operations. This role is designed to function as an extension of me operationally. The primary objective is to reduce friction, close loops, and keep the business moving forward.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a results-driven, long-term role. The specific tasks will evolve over time as trust is built and as you take on more responsibility. Accounts Receivable, invoicing, and outbound phone calls are core initial responsibilities, but this is not a narrow or static role.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis position is not task-only or “on-demand.” You will be on call, at your computer, during scheduled hours and expected to self-manage time professionally. These time slots are: 8:00 AM – 12PM Pacific Time (Seattle) and 8:00pm - 10PM Pacific Time (Seattle)\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Responsibilities (Initial Scope)\n\r\nYou will assist me with daily operational execution, including but not limited to:\n\r\n\n\r\nQuickBooks Online support\n\r\n\n\r\nAccounts Receivable and Accounts Payable tracking\n\r\n\n\r\nInvoicing and payment follow-ups\n\r\n\n\r\nOutbound phone calls to customers, vendors, and accounts on my behalf to gather feedback, confirm details, and resolve open items\n\r\n\n\r\nDocumentation of outcomes and ensuring tasks are actually completed, not just attempted\n\r\n\n\r\nAs the role matures, responsibilities will expand into broader operational support based on performance and reliability.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Skills & Experience\n\r\nStrong, hands-on experience with QuickBooks Online is mandatory, including AR and AP workflows. You must be confident and professional on the phone, capable of representing the business clearly and competently. You must demonstrate strong self-management, time discipline, and written communication. You must be comfortable remaining at your workstation and available during scheduled hours, even during slower periods. You must be comfortable with screen sharing or screen recording during clocked-in hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Expectations & Accountability\n\r\nResults are what matter. Output, accuracy, and follow-through take priority over appearances or “busy work.”\n\r\n\n\r\nHonesty is non-negotiable. Dishonest timekeeping, inflated activity, or misrepresentation of work will result in immediate termination. This role operates on trust backed by verification. You are expected to manage your workload independently, stay engaged, and proactively identify productive work when task volume is low.\n\r\n\n\r\nBeing available during scheduled hours is required. Being disengaged, unreachable, or misreporting activity is not acceptable.\n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule & Availability\n\r\nMust be on Desk Working For between 8:00 AM – 12PM Pacific Time (Seattle) and 8:00pm - 10PM Pacific Time (Seattle). If candidate proves to be a good fit, additional projects can be worked in addition to these time slots at their own discretion (Up to 40 hours per week) \n\r\n\n\r\nWho This Role Is For\n\r\nThis role is for someone who wants a long-term virtual executive assistant position, values accountability, and is comfortable operating in a results-first environment. If you take ownership, adapt quickly, and want to grow alongside a business rather than hop between short-term gigs, this role is a strong fit. \n\r\n\n\r\nMessage from the business Owner:\n\r\nI'm looking for a strong Executive Assistant to help me manage my day to day operations and business. I've had experience working with Other VA's but I haven't come across a VA i'm looking to invest or commit to long term. If you are looking to just work for pay and treat this as a job, I'm sorry this isn't the job for you. I'm looking for someone who would join me in trying to make my business successful and understand that this isn't just a job for me, its my business and pursuing to grow it and continue on with other businesses. The right candidate for me understands my position (previous experience will help if you have been an executive assistant to another business owner)  and really puts their best effort in helping me succeed and run my business and you have my word, I will return the favor to the right candidate. I don't expect to find the right candidate immediately but I appreciate you for applying and working with me if you have. Thank you for taking the time to read this. \n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nTo be considered, you must submit all of the following:\n\r\n\n\r\nA brief video (1–3 minutes) of yourself speaking in English to demonstrate communication clarity and professionalism.\n\r\n\n\r\nA summary of your relevant work history, with emphasis on QuickBooks Online, AR/AP, invoicing, and phone-based responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\nA short written explanation of why you are a strong fit for this role, specifically addressing results, self-management, honesty, and your interest in a long-term position.\n\r\n\n\r\niPhone or access to iMessages is a big advantage because this is where communication happens. Thanks for understanding!\n\r\n\n\r\nPay: Flat Retainer $200 Per week or hourly Rate $10 per hour, which ever is higher and paid weekly.                ",

    "description": "\n                    The Opportunity\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re looking for someone who sits at the intersection of data engineering and B2B lead generation. Not a pure data scientist who wants to build models in Jupyter notebooks all day, and not a pure SDR who manually scrolls LinkedIn. We need the person in the middle — someone who can build automated enrichment pipelines that turn raw prospect lists into scored, personalized, outreach-ready leads at scale.\n\r\n\n\r\nThink of it this way: our BDRs currently spend 60% of their time researching and qualifying leads. Your job is to flip that ratio so they spend 90% of their time actually talking to prospects.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Own\n\r\n1. Enrichment Pipeline Architecture (\n)\n\r\nBuild and maintain automated Clay tables that take raw prospect lists and enrich them through chained data sources:\n\r\n• LinkedIn Sales Navigator exports ? Clay ingestion\n\r\n• \n + phone enrichment with waterfall fallback \n\r\n•\n deliverability verification \n\r\n• Decision-maker title and seniority confirmation\n\r\n• Company size, employee count, and location count\n\r\n• Website scraping for retail product pages — detect whether the clinic sells skincare products online, which brands they carry (SkinCeuticals, ZO Skin Health, Environ, etc.), and whether they have a house/private label line\n\r\n• LinkedIn activity recency (active profiles = higher outreach response rates)\n\r\n• Growth signals from job postings and new location announcements\n\r\nYou own the entire pipeline from raw list to CRM-ready enriched record.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. ICP Scoring Model\n\r\nDesign and iterate on a lead scoring system based on our Ideal Customer Profile:\n\r\n• Clinic type weighting (medical spa > dermatology > plastic surgery > day spa)\n\r\n• Decision-maker seniority (Owner/Founder > Medical Director > VP Ops > Practice Manager)\n\r\n• Company size and growth signals (new locations, recent hiring, job postings)\n\r\n• Retail product signals — clinics with an online shop or product page score higher than those without\n\r\n• Private label indicators — clinics already selling a house-brand line signal existing manufacturer relationships\n\r\n• Geographic market priority (US Tier 1 states > secondary markets > international)\n\r\n• LinkedIn activity and engagement recency\n\r\nOutput: every lead gets a 0–100 score and a Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Disqualify tag before any human touches it.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. CRM Data Operations (HubSpot)\n\r\nEnsure enriched, scored leads flow cleanly into our HubSpot CRM with all custom properties populated:\n\r\n• Clay ? HubSpot sync (automated push of enriched records)\n\r\n• Contact deduplication and data hygiene\n\r\n• Custom property population (we have 161 custom properties across Companies, Contacts, and Deals)\n\r\n• Filtered views by contact type, lead score, geography, and engagement stage\n\r\n• Weekly data quality audits \n bounce rates, missing fields, stale records)\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Outreach Personalization Data\n\r\nFeed our BDRs the personalization hooks they need to write messages that convert:\n\r\n• Current product brands the clinic carries (scraped from website shop/retail pages)\n\r\n• Whether they sell a private label or house-brand skincare line (signals existing manufacturer relationship)\n\r\n• Recent LinkedIn posts or articles by the prospect\n\r\n• Growth signals (new location openings, recent hiring, job postings)\n\r\n• Review sentiment indicators — Google/Yelp mentions of products, skincare results, or retail experience\n\r\n• Any mentions of international sourcing, K-beauty, or clean beauty on their website or social\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Feedback Loop & Optimization\n\r\nClose the loop between enrichment quality and actual conversion:\n\r\n• Track which scored leads convert to discovery calls vs. which don’t\n\r\n• Refine scoring weights based on real pipeline data\n\r\n• A/B test different enrichment sources for accuracy and cost-effectiveness\n\r\n• Monthly report: conversion rates by score tier, data accuracy metrics, pipeline contribution\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\nSkills\n\r\n• Proficiency with \n (table building, waterfall enrichment, API integrations)\n\r\n• Experience with \n, \n, or similar\n/contact enrichment tools\n\r\n• LinkedIn Sales Navigator fluency (boolean searches, saved searches, list exports)\n\r\n• HubSpot CRM experience (contact/company/deal management, custom properties, views)\n\r\n• Basic scripting ability (Python, JavaScript, or n8n/Zapier for automation glue)\n\r\n• Understanding of B2B lead generation workflows and sales development processes\n\r\n• Strong English communication (written reports, async Slack updates)\n\r\n\n\r\nNice-to-Have Skills\n\r\n• Experience in healthcare, aesthetics, medical devices, or cosmetics B2B\n\r\n• Familiarity with n8n or \n for workflow automation\n\r\n• SQL or spreadsheet-level data analysis (pivot tables, VLOOKUP, data cleaning)\n\r\n• Experience building lead scoring models (even simple weighted models)\n\r\n• Knowledge of\n deliverability best practices (SPF, DKIM, warm-up)\n\r\n• Web scraping experience (extracting product/brand data from clinic websites)\n\r\nMindset\n\r\n• Builder mentality — you’d rather automate a 2-hour task than do it manually twice\n\r\n• Comfortable with ambiguity — we’re pre-revenue and figuring things out\n\r\n• Data-driven but practical — a good-enough model shipped today beats a perfect model next month\n\r\n• Ownership orientation — you flag problems AND propose solutions\n\r\n\n\r\nTech Stack\n\r\n\n\r\n\n Enrichment pipeline, waterfall logic, lead scoring Provided\n\r\n\n/phone finding, contact database Provided\n\r\nLinkedIn Sales Nav Prospect identification, boolean search Provided\n\r\nHubSpot CRM Pipeline management, 161 custom properties Provided\n\r\nZeroBounce / AbstractAPI\n verification Provided\n\r\nGoogle Sheets Supplemental analysis, reporting Provided\n\r\nSlack Team communication, async updates Provided\n\r\nLoom Async walkthroughs and demos Provided\n\r\nn8n (optional) Workflow automation if needed Available\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat a Sample Week Looks Like\n\r\nMonday — Pipeline Build & Refresh (4 hrs)\n\r\n• Pull new Sales Navigator searches for target geographies\n\r\n• Ingest into Clay tables, kick off enrichment chains\n\r\n• QA overnight enrichment results from prior batch\n\r\nTuesday — Scoring & CRM Push (3 hrs)\n\r\n• Run scoring model on enriched batch\n\r\n• Push Tier 1 and Tier 2 leads to HubSpot with all fields populated\n\r\n• Flag any data quality issues (high bounce risk\ns, missing fields)\n\r\nWednesday — Personalization Layer (4 hrs)\n\r\n• Enrich Tier 1 leads with personalization hooks (product brands carried, private label status, recent posts)\n\r\n• Build personalization notes for BDR outreach templates\n\r\n• Coordinate with BDRs on priority accounts\n\r\nThursday — Optimization & Analysis (3 hrs)\n\r\n• Pull conversion data: which leads from last 2 weeks got meetings?\n\r\n• Analyze patterns: what scoring factors predicted conversion?\n\r\n• Adjust weights, test new enrichment sources\n\r\nFriday — Reporting & Planning (3 hrs)\n\r\n• Weekly report: leads enriched, scoring distribution, data quality metrics\n\r\n• Pipeline contribution summary for team standup\n\r\n• Plan next week’s target geographies and enrichment experiments\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Performance Indicators\n\r\n\n\r\nEnriched leads delivered per week \n\r\n accuracy rate \n\r\nEnrichment completeness\n\r\nTier 1 leads per week \n\r\nCRM data freshness \n\r\nScoring model accuracy \n\r\nWeekly report delivery \n\r\n\n\r\nGrowth Path\n\r\nThis role has a clear trajectory as MultiOrigin Partners scales:\n\r\n• Phase 1 (Now): 15–25 hrs/week.

This role is not training-based and has no ramp period. We are looking for someone confident in their ability to produce strong sourcing results from Day 1.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis position is best suited for researchers who are comfortable being measured on output and who have worked in fast-paced, numbers-driven sourcing roles before.\n\r\n\n\r\nPerformance Metric (DPP):\n\r\nPerformance in this role is measured using DPP (Daily Profit Potential).\n\r\nDPP means the total estimated profit from approved ASINs purchased in one day.\n\r\n\n\r\nExample:\n\r\nIf in one day the following ASINs are purchased:\n\r\n• $20 profit × 3 units\n\r\n• $15 profit × 3 units\n\r\n• $10 profit × 4 units\n\r\n• $8 profit × 5 units\n\r\n• Several other ASINs at $5–$7 profit with 2–3 units each\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd the combined profit adds up to $300, then your DPP for that day is $300. DPP is tracked daily and averaged over time to evaluate performance.\n\r\n\n\r\nTrial Period:\n\r\nAll candidates who pass the written screening will complete a brief interview with our Operations Manager.\n\r\nCandidates who pass the interview will then proceed to a paid one-week trial.\n\r\n• Trial length: up to 5 working days (maximum 40 hours)\n\r\n• Performance is evaluated from Day 1\n\r\n• There is no training or ramp period\n\r\n\n\r\nDuring the trial:\n\r\n• Results are expected immediately and must be consistent through the week\n\r\n• $200 average daily DPP is the minimum performance baseline\n\r\nWe reserve the right to end the trial early if performance is clearly below expectations.\n\r\n\n\r\nPay & Performance Upside:\n\r\nThis role is designed for researchers who want to be paid for results, not just hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nResearchers who perform well earn monthly performance incentives based on DPP. Strong researchers in our business are able to reach $300+ average daily DPP, which results in meaningful monthly incentive pay.\n\r\n$200 average daily DPP is the baseline. Any performance above $200 earns a monthly incentive.\n\r\n\n\r\nIncentive formula:\n\r\n(Average daily DPP ? 200) × 20 working days × 15%\n\r\nExample:\n\r\nAverage daily DPP = $300\n\r\nThat is $100 above baseline\n\r\n$100 × 20 = $2,000\n\r\n15% = $300 incentive for the month\n\r\n\n\r\nThe hourly base rate is set at a standard VA level, with higher earnings coming from performance-based incentives.\n\r\nMonthly examples are for illustration only. Actual earnings depend on hours worked and DPP performance.\n\r\nSustained performance below expectations is subject to a performance improvement plan.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply (Required):\n\r\nWe use a written screening questionnaire as the first step. This is required.\n\r\nPlease complete the questionnaire at the link below:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send messages through OnlineJobs.ph.\n\r\nOnly completed questionnaires will be reviewed.\n\r\nCandidates who pass the questionnaire will be contacted by\n for the next step.
