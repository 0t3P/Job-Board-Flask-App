    "description": "\n                    ABOUT THE ROLE & VISION\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a growing property management company (Dream Cabin Getaways) managing luxury short-term rentals in the Tennessee Smoky Mountains and a long-term portfolio in Minnesota. We are moving from a \"startup\" phase into a professionalized \"Operations\" phase.\n\r\nWe aren't looking for a task-taker; we are looking for a Controller—someone who thinks like an owner, protects our cash flow, and ensures our systems remain airtight as we scale.\n\r\n\n\r\nPOSITION OVERVIEW\n\r\nSalary Range: $525 – $785 USD / Month. 20 hours/ week ($6.00 – $9.00/hr for 20 hours/week).\n\r\nHours: 20 hours per week (Target: 9:00 AM – 1:00 PM US Eastern Time).\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY JOIN DREAM CABIN GETAWAYS?\n\r\nGrowth-Minded & Solutions-Focused: We don’t dwell on problems; we find solutions. We want people who are hungry to learn, grow, and improve our systems every day.\n\r\n\n\r\nPositive Energy: Property management sometimes involves surprise challenges. Pipes burst, tenants stop paying. It is critical that we approach our work with a positive attitude. We value collaboration, open communication, and a \"can-do\" spirit.\n\r\nA Relationship, Not a Transaction: We want a years-long partnership where you feel supported, trusted, and empowered to make decisions.\n\r\n\n\r\nImpact Over Activity: We value outcomes. You won't be micromanaged; you will be given clear goals and the freedom to execute, along with the support to be able to succeed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR WEEKLY FOCUS\n\r\n10?counting & Trust Management: You handle complex deposit reconciliations (OwnerRez/Airbnb/Vrbo) into REIhub and generate professional Monthly Owner Statements for our PM clients.\n\r\n\n\r\n60% Operations & Loop-Closing: You own maintenance from \"Reported\" to \"Invoiced\". You enforce the 24-Hour No-Update Rule, providing proactive status updates on all open projects in \n without being prompted.\n\r\n\n\r\n20% Financial Administration: You audit and pay contractor invoices, ensuring billed hours match agreements. You manage purchasing for cabin supplies to keep our \"jewel properties\" guest-ready.\n\r\n\n\r\n10% High-Level Support: You provide expert backup for our STR Manager (Jeneff) during her time off.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Experience & Technical Skills\n\r\nExperience: 3+ years in US-based Property Management is required. You must understand the \"rhythm\" and details of property management—from lease renewals to emergency repairs. Short term and long-term experience a plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nFinancial Rigor: Proven experience with Accounting for Real Estate including Short Term Rentals. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe Tech Stack: While we use OwnerRez, REIhub, and \n, we value your PM and Accounting Experience over your specific software experience. If you are an expert in the industry, and familiar with competitor tools, we can train you on our specific stack.\n\r\n\n\r\nAssertiveness: You are comfortable \"chasing\" contractors and tenants with a smile, and holding vendors accountable to their bids.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nTo verify your attention to detail and financial expertise, please follow these steps exactly:\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject Line: Include the name of the original bass player for the Grateful Dead.\n\r\n\n\r\nCover Letter (Paragraph 3): Include the phrase \"closing the loop.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Initiative Test: Describe a specific time you solved a contractor or tenant problem without waiting for direction.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Financial Filter: Briefly describe your past accounting/bookkeeping work. Specifically:\n\r\n\n\r\nWhich software have you used (REIhub, QBO, Xero)?\n\r\nHave you ever managed Trust Accounting or Owner Statements?\n\r\nIn 2-3 sentences, how do you handle a situation where an Airbnb payout doesn't match the expected booking amount in your PMS (like OwnerRez)?

Are you the one who remembers everyone’s birthdays, plans amazing gatherings, makes fun plans, and brings warmth into the lives of those around you?\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT your typical assistant job. It’s deeply personal. You’ll work with a kind but intense U.S.-based pair of brothers (proven entrepreneurs working as Co-CEOs of the same business) to support their lives, not the company they are building. From keeping friendships alive and planning meaningful experiences to sending thoughtful gifts and helping them stay on track with personal goals, you’ll be part organizer, part cheerleader, part coach. If you’ve ever been called the “mom” of your group and you’re looking for a decades-long position, this might be your dream job.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Role\n\r\n* Build trust by executing on tasks and communicating clearly, which will lead to taking on more responsibility, which will then lead to increases in pay.\n\r\n* Keep relationships thriving by managing a personal CRM and helping stay in touch with friends and family.\n\r\n* Use technology to help automate certain tasks that are repetitive.\n\r\n* Track habits, support routines, and act as an accountability partner for personal goals.\n\r\n* Pick out thoughtful, creative gifts for birthdays and other special \nnts.\n\r\n* Research products, tools, and ideas to make life easier, better, or more fun.\n\r\n* Plan and book unforgettable travel, great hotels, and the perfect dinner spots.\n\r\n* Jump in on special personal projects wherever a helping hand is needed.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat’s In It for You\n\r\n* A Long-Term Role: This is meant to last. The entrepreneurs who you'd be an assistant to are looking for a lifetime assistant.\n\r\n* Great Place to Work: These entrepreneurs are known to have a super high retention rate of employees and create a great work environment.\n\r\n* Creative Work: From planning memorable trips to picking out the perfect gift, this role lets you flex your creative muscles and thoughtful side every day.\n\r\n* Variety: No two days will feel the same. You’ll get to research, plan, coach, organize, and more.\n\r\n* Paid Leave: You'll get at least 10 days of paid leave plus major holidays.\n\r\n* Remote Flexibility: Work from the comfort of your home and gain flexibility with hours once trust is built.\n\r\n\n\r\nDesired Attributes\n\r\n* Extremely caring, social people-person who will excel in personal tasks\n\r\n* High attention to detail and organizational skills\n\r\n* Very strong written and oral English skills\n\r\n* Minimum 50 Mbps Internet Speed\n\r\n* Designated office space in your home\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply and ensure your application is considered, do all of the following two steps:\n\r\n1.

Include the word \"cupcake\" *in your subject line*, and Include your resume. ++Bonus points for a video introduction, though it's not strictly required\n\r\n2. Fill out this form:\n\r\n3.

They share some of the same marketplace APIs but were built independently, with different coding patterns and some overlapping logic.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe want to bring these together into a unified platform and add accounting automation (Xero) so that marketplace payouts automatically generate invoices and reconcile against bank payments and develop the platform into a commercial solution that can be sold on.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Need\n\r\nSomeone who can look at this situation and help us figure out what to build and why — before we write code. The kind of person who:\n\r\n- Asks the right questions before jumping to answers\n\r\n- Can map out business processes and spot where systems overlap or conflict\n\r\n- Understands e-commerce operations (marketplaces, fulfilment, settlements)\n\r\n- Can bridge the gap between business needs and technical implementation\n\r\n- Is comfortable working alongside developers and AI tools, not threatened by them\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nDon't send me a generic CV or a list of tools you know.

It works.\n\r\n* The Opportunity: The product is solid, meaning the chance of \"Zero Sales\" is near nil if you put in the work.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE MONEY (BASE + HIGH COMMISSION):\n\r\nWe are looking for a partner, not an employee. We are willing to invest in the right person.\n\r\n\n\r\n* Base Salary: Negotiable. (We are happy to discuss a base retainer for a candidate with a proven track record).\n\r\n* The Commission: This is where you make your real money. You earn approx. 14,000 PHP ($335 CAD) for every single sale.\n\r\n* The Target: Close just 2 deals a month = 28,000 PHP.\n\r\n* The Accelerator: Continue earning 14,000 PHP for every single sale after that.\n\r\n* The Potential: Uncapped. Our top reps aim for 60,\n,000+ PHP monthly.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE ROLE:\n\r\n\n\r\n* Outbound Hunting: You will call North American businesses (EST hours) to demo our software.\n\r\n* Closing: You are not just setting appointments; you are closing the deal.\n\r\n* Tools: We provide the dialer, the leads, and the training. You bring the hustle.\n\r\n* Schedule: Flexible, but you must be willing to make calls during Canadian Business Hours (Eastern Standard Time).\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO YOU ARE:\n\r\n\n\r\n* Hungry: You prefer uncapped commission over a limited salary because you know you can sell.\n\r\n* Experienced: You have done outbound B2B sales or appointment setting before (SaaS preferred).\n\r\n* Tech-Savvy: You can learn a new software product quickly so you can demo it with confidence.\n\r\n* Resilient: You have a thick skin and a neutral/professional English accent.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY (STRICT REQUIREMENT):\n\r\nI am looking for a star. To prove it is you:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Send a message with the subject line: \"I'm Hungry\"\n\r\n2. Include a link to your resume/profile.\n\r\n3. MANDATORY: Include a link to a 60-second voice recording (Vocaroo or Google Drive) telling me why you prefer commission sales.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: Applications without a voice recording will not be reviewed.

This is not a traditional accounting seat. We need a seasoned CPA who has lived in the trenches of hedge funds, high-growth startups, and complex multi-entity operations—and who brings the rare ability to build scalable, automated finance systems from the ground up.\n\r\nYou'll own the full finance function: month-end close, financial reporting, forecasting, compliance, and investor-ready deliverables. What sets this role apart is the expectation that you will also architect and automate the systems behind these processes—leveraging SQL, Brex, and modern tooling to eliminate manual work, improve data integrity, and unlock strategic insight.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Own\n\r\nFinancial Reporting & Close\n\r\nLead monthly, quarterly, and year-end close processes across multiple entities and currencies. Prepare US GAAP-compliant financial statements, management reports, and board-ready materials. Own revenue recognition, accruals, journal entries, intercompany eliminations, and reconciliations. Manage fund accounting, NAV calculations, and investor reporting as applicable.\n\r\nForecasting, Budgeting & Strategic Finance\n\r\nBuild and maintain dynamic forecasting and cash flow models that inform executive decision-making. Lead annual budgeting cycles and deliver monthly variance analysis with actionable narrative. Partner with leadership on scenario planning, capital allocation, and profitability analysis.\n\r\nFinance Systems & Automation\n\r\nDesign, build, and maintain automated financial workflows that eliminate manual bottlenecks. Write SQL queries (PostgreSQL) for financial reporting, data extraction, and reconciliation at scale. Develop Python scripts for trading system integrations, API-driven data pipelines, and financial automation. Build BI dashboards  and custom reporting systems for real-time financial visibility. Implement AI-assisted process optimization to continuously improve finance operations.\n\r\nCompliance, Tax & Legal Coordination\n\r\nOversee payroll processing, sales tax compliance, and government reporting requirements. Manage government compliance filings, loan applications, and audit preparation. Coordinate with external counsel and auditors on contract reviews, regulatory matters, and legal documentation.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nNon-Negotiables\n\r\n\n\r\nActive CPA license in good standing\n\r\n10+ years of progressive accounting experience spanning fund accounting, startup finance, and/or multi-entity operations\n\r\nDeep expertise in US GAAP financial reporting, monthly close, and consolidation\n\r\nProficiency in SQL (PostgreSQL preferred) for financial data querying and reporting\n\r\nHands-on experience with Python for financial automation, API integrations, or trading system support\n\r\nAdvanced Excel and Google Sheets skills including complex nested formulas, financial models, and automated dashboards\n\r\nDemonstrated ability to design and implement process automation and scalable finance workflows\n\r\nExperience with QuickBooks Online in a multi-entity environment\n\r\n\n\r\nStrongly Preferred\n\r\n\n\r\nBackground in hedge fund accounting, NAV reporting, or alternative investment operations\n\r\nExperience with BI/analytics platforms\n\r\nFamiliarity with Microsoft Access for custom reporting systems\n\r\nTrack record managing payroll, sales tax, and multi-state compliance\n\r\nExperience with government loan applications (SBA, PPP, EIDL, or similar)\n\r\nComfort operating in fast-paced, resource-constrained environments where you build the plane while flying it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Sets You Apart\n\r\nYou don't just close the books—you ask why the process took 10 days and engineer it down to 3. You see a messy reconciliation and build a powered pipeline to handle it. You understand that clean financial data is a strategic asset, not just a compliance obligation. You move fluidly between debits and credits, scripts, and board presentations.\n\r\nThe ideal candidate combines the analytical discipline of a Big 4-trained accountant with the builder's mindset of a startup operator. You're equally comfortable presenting to investors, debugging a data pipeline, and negotiating with auditors.                ",

You will collaborate with internal teams (Content, Data, Sales, and Tech) and external stakeholders to ensure projects are delivered on time, within scope, and—most importantly—aligned with the client’s ROI goals.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\n• Campaign Lifecycle Management: Oversee the execution of lead generation,\n marketing, and digital display campaigns from kickoff to final reporting.\n\r\n• Stakeholder Communication: Serve as the primary point of contact for clients, providing regular status updates, managing expectations, and resolving bottlenecks.\n\r\n• Resource Allocation: Coordinate with the Content Creation and Data teams to ensure assets (white papers, surveys, lead lists) are ready for deployment.\n\r\n• Quality Assurance: Audit campaign setups to ensure they meet PMG360’s high standards for lead quality and data accuracy.\n\r\n• Timeline & Budget Tracking: Monitor project milestones using tools like Asana, \n, or Jira to prevent scope creep and ensure profitability.\n\r\n• Process Optimization: Continuously refine internal workflows to improve the speed and efficiency of service delivery.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Qualifications\n\r\n• Experience: 3–5 years of project management experience, preferably within a marketing agency or B2B media company.\n\r\n• Industry Knowledge: Familiarity with the B2B lead generation funnel (MQLs, SQLs, and Content Syndication).\n\r\n• Technical Savvy: Proficiency in CRM platforms (HubSpot, Salesforce) and project management software.\n\r\n• Data Literacy: Ability to interpret campaign analytics and translate \"raw data\" into actionable insights for clients.\n\r\n• Certifications: PMP or CAPM certification is a strong plus, but equivalent \"in-the-trenches\" experience is valued.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Competencies\n\r\n• Adaptive Problem-Solving: The ability to pivot when a campaign isn't hitting its lead targets.\n\r\n• Precision: High attention to detail (missing a single tracking pixel can ruin a campaign).\n\r\n• Diplomacy: Balancing the needs of the sales team with the actual capacity of the production team.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’re an experienced Project Manager with a background in marketing and digital services, we’d love to connect. Please submit your resume and a brief overview of your relevant experience.                ",
