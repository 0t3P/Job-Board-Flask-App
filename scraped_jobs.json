They have heard every scripted opener, every \"Hi sir, how are you doing today\", every fake cheerful introduction — and they hang up before you finish your sentence.\n\n\n\nIf your style is formal, stiff, or scripted — do not apply. SERIOUSLY, DO NOT. You will burn through the list and produce nothing.\n\n\n\nThe only people who get these guys to stay on the phone are the ones who talk to them like a normal human being. Casual. Direct. No fluff. Think less \"Good afternoon sir, my name is John and I am calling on behalf of\" and more \"Hey man, got a quick second?\" If that is not how you naturally operate on a cold call, this is not your job and we do not want to hear from you. Move on.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nTHE JOB\n\n\n\nYou will receive a list of 5,000 cold leads. You call every single one. You book appointments. You log every outcome. You confirm every booking with a check-in call 2 hours before the meeting. That is the job. Nothing less qualifies as complete.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nHOW PAYMENT WORKS\n\n\n\n- $600 USD is your fixed base — paid only when all 5,000 contacts have been called and all outcomes are fully logged\n\n- Partial completion does not qualify for any payment under any circumstance\n\n- Bonuses are paid on top of the base and determined by confirmed, qualified bookings only\n\n\n\nBelow 200 bookings — $600 base only. No bonus. No exceptions.\n\n200–219 bookings — $600 + $500 bonus = $1,100 USD total\n\n220–249 bookings — $600 + $750 bonus = $1,350 USD total\n\n250+ bookings — $600 + $1,900 bonus = $2,500 USD total + monthly ongoing role offered\n\n\n\nA booking only counts when the prospect is genuinely qualified, understands what the meeting is about, and has been confirmed via a check-in call approximately 2 hours before their scheduled time. Inflated, weak, or misleading bookings are not counted and will reflect on your review. In other words ... if you just book just to get the 250+ bookings, that will not count.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nWHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO\n\n\n\n- Work through all 5,000 leads in a disciplined, systematic way\n\n- Attempt each lead up to 3 times at varied times of day before marking as unreachable — morning, midday, and afternoon or evening windows\n\n- Pitch naturally, qualify fast, and book only prospects who genuinely fit\n\n- Log every call outcome and note into our CRM or tracking sheet\n\n- Send confirmation details to every booked prospect immediately after booking\n\n- Call every booked prospect approximately 2 hours before their meeting to confirm attendance — if they need to reschedule, handle it on the spot, update the calendar, and log the change\n\n- Submit a full outcome report once the list is complete\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nPERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS\n\n\n\n- 200 bookings (4%) — Minimum to qualify for full payment\n\n- 225 bookings (4.5%) — Strong performance\n\n- 250+ bookings (5%+) — Outstanding. A monthly role with a good 4 digit salary (2-3-4k a month) might be offered.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n\n\n- Proven outbound cold calling experience specifically for marketing agencies — this is non-negotiable\n\n- Real estate cold calling does not count — do not list it as relevant experience\n\n- Fluent, confident English with no heavy accent, mumbling\n\n- Natural and human on the phone — not robotic, not scripted-sounding\n\n- Able to handle rejection and keep dialing without losing energy or discipline\n\n- Able to accurately qualify leads during the call — not just push anyone into a slot to inflate numbers\n\n- Disciplined with follow-through — the pre-meeting confirmation call is mandatory, not optional\n\n- Reliable internet and a quality headset — audio must be crystal clear\n\n- Able to work fully independently with zero supervision\n\n- Able to complete the full project within a reasonable timeframe\n\n- Familiar with GHL or Google Sheets for tracking                                ",

    "description": "\n                    We're building something most businesses haven't even realised is possible.\n\r\n\n\r\nPet Let is an Australian holiday rental company that's been operating since 2009. We have a large property portfolio, a team across two countries, and a database of more than 13,000 guests.\n\r\nAnd we're in the middle of building a fully AI-powered operation.\n\r\nNot chatbots. Not auto-replies. A genuine network of AI agents that can run core business functions — guest communications, operations coordination, financial processing, reporting, and marketing — with a lean human team providing oversight and handling what genuinely needs human judgment.\n\r\nWe have a diverse tech stack including a property management system, a property operations and task management platform, trust accounting software, and Google Workspace as our communications and data backbone. Your job is to connect all of it to Claude, and build agents and dashboards on top of those connections that make the whole business smarter and faster.\n\r\nWe know where we're going. We need someone to help us get there.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat the role looks like:\n\r\nYou'll work directly with our CEO and Operations Manager. You'll design, build, and deploy — hands on, every day.  You ask questions, dig deep, can understand business processes.  You think and understand fast.  \n\r\n\n\r\nThe work has two major pillars:\n\r\nAI agents — using MCP servers to connect Claude directly to our business systems, then building agents that can act autonomously across those systems: receiving inputs, making decisions, triggering actions, and closing the loop without a human in the middle.\n\r\n\n\r\nLive dashboards — building real-time operational and business dashboards that give leadership and each team a clear view of what's happening and what needs attention. You choose the right tool for the job.\n\r\n\n\r\nBeyond that, the roadmap is broad and the problems are real. You'll have genuine ownership of meaningful work from day one.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho we're looking for\n\r\nYou live in Claude. You've shipped Claude Artifacts. You use Claude Cowork and Code daily and you love letting it do the heavy lifting while you direct the outcome.  Clawdbot/Moltbot/OpenClaw blew your mind.  And now the hype is over, you get what the future looks like and you want to ride that wave.  \n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand MCP — ideally you've built MCP servers and you get why they're the key to turning Claude from an assistant into an agent that can actually act in real systems.\n\r\nYou know Python. You can read an API and build a connection. You've built dashboards that pull live data and help people make decisions.\n\r\nYou don't need to be managed. You need a clear problem and the trust to solve it.\n\r\nHonestly? We're looking for someone who gets so excited about this stuff that the idea of locking yourself away with your favourite drink, your favourite snacks, and a massive problem to solve sounds less like work and more like the best possible way to spend a day. Our CEO is currently losing sleep because she's so energised by what's possible. We want someone who gets that feeling.\n\r\n\n\r\nNon-negotiable:\n\r\n\n\r\nFluent in Python\n\r\nDeep, daily Claude user — Artifacts, Claude Code, the works\n\r\nUnderstands and has worked with MCP\n\r\nHas built things with the Claude or OpenAI API and can show us\n\r\nCan build interactive dashboards connected to live data\n\r\nStrong written English\n\r\nSelf-directed and genuinely motivated by this technology\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong advantage:\n\r\n\n\r\nGoogle Workspace API experience\n\r\nWorkflow automation (n8n, Make, Zapier)\n\r\nExperience with agentic frameworks\n\r\nAny background in hospitality, property management, or operational businesses\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the salary — let's be straight with you\n\r\nWe're starting at $800–$1,200 USD/month. We'll be honest about why: we've been burnt before by people who interview well but can't execute. So we start cautious.\n\r\nBut here's the flip side. If you can do what this ad describes — if you can take our vision and actually ship it, fast — your value to us goes up dramatically and your rate will reflect that. We'll review your compensation as soon as the first element of the vision is live and working, which could be within the first two weeks. After that, regular reviews tied directly to progress.\n\r\nWe're not looking for someone to pay minimally and keep there. We're looking for someone who proves they're exceptional and then gets rewarded for it. If that's you, this is a very good opportunity.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we offer\n\r\n\n\r\nContract  — 40 hours/week\n\r\nBonus\n\r\nStarting remuneration of $800–$1,200 USD/month with fast review based on delivery\n\r\nDirect access to decision-makers — no layers, no bureaucracy\n\r\nReal ownership of a genuinely ambitious project\n\r\nA business that is all-in on this and moving fast\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply\n\r\nSend us three things:\n\r\n\n\r\nWho you are and why this excites you — keep it honest and specific\n\r\nSomething you've built using Claude or another AI API — a link, a repo, a demo, a description. Show us how you think and what you ship\n\r\nYour answer to this: If you were connecting Claude to a business system via MCP, what's the first tool you'd expose and why?\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications without examples of real work will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nPet Let has been making holidays better for pet owners since 2009. We think AI is about to let us do that at a level that simply wasn't possible before. Come help us build it.\n\r\n\n                ",

We’ve served 65,000+ customers and are looking for a detail-oriented Customer Support Specialist to own the full customer experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT a typical VA role where you answer a few\ns. You will be the frontline of our customer experience — handling tickets, managing reviews, coordinating with our fulfillment partner, and making sure every customer interaction is fast, friendly, and resolved properly.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have detailed SOPs, pre-written response templates, and clear escalation rules. You will follow established systems, and help improve them. If you’re someone who thrives with clear processes and takes pride in executing them perfectly, this role is for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Do Every Day\n\r\n• Respond to all customer support tickets via our helpdesk (CommSlayer) using pre-built macros and templates. You will rarely write a response from scratch — we have a macro for almost every scenario.\n\r\n• Monitor and manage our Shopify admin: check order statuses, process exchanges, initiate refunds, update customer information, and resolve order issues.\n\r\n• Respond to Trustpilot reviews. Negative reviews (1-3 stars) get priority and follow a specific recovery process.\n\r\n• Coordinate with our fulfillment partner: replacement shipments, product quality concerns, tracking issues, and stock-level questions. Communication is via\n in English.\n\r\n• Arrange exchanges and returns: confirm new size with customer, create replacement order in Shopify, send return instructions, track that the process completes.\n\r\n• Flag and escalate problems that fall outside normal SOPs to the team lead or business owner via Slack. You will have clear rules on what to escalate and when.\n\r\n• Maintain a daily log of any recurring issues, unusual complaints, or product quality concerns so we can spot problems early.\n\r\n\n\r\nWeekly Responsibilities\n\r\n• Friday audit: Review the week’s tickets and provide a 5-line summary — total tickets, average response time, any unresolved issues, Trustpilot rating, and the most common complaint theme that week.\n\r\n• Ensure zero unresolved tickets at end of each business day (responded to or escalated).\n\r\n• Keep our FAQ and macro library updated — if you notice a new question coming up repeatedly, flag it so we can create a macro for it.\n\r\n\n\r\nTools You’ll Use\n\r\n• CommSlayer (helpdesk / ticket management)\n\r\n• Shopify (order management, refunds, exchanges)\n\r\n• Trustpilot (review monitoring and responses)\n\r\n• Slack (team communication and escalations)\n\r\n• Google Sheets (daily logging and reporting)\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n• Minimum 1 year experience in eCommerce customer support (Shopify experience strongly preferred)\n\r\n• Excellent written English — friendly, natural, casual tone (not corporate or robotic)\n\r\n• Experience processing refunds, exchanges, and returns in Shopify\n\r\n• Reliable internet connection and a quiet workspace\n\r\n• Available to work Australian business hours (AEST) or overlap with them significantly\n\r\n• Detail-oriented — you follow SOPs exactly as written, every time\n\r\n• You can handle a moderate volume of tickets (60 per day) without rushing or cutting corners\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus (Not Required)\n\r\n• Experience with CommSlayer, Gorgias, or Zendesk\n\r\n• Experience with Trustpilot or other review platforms\n\r\n• Experience communicating with Chinese suppliers/fulfillment partners\n\r\n• Experience setting up customer service automations or macros\n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule & Compensation\n\r\n• Full-time: 40 hours per week\n\r\n• Schedule: Monday to Friday, with some weekend monitoring required (check and respond to urgent tickets on Saturday — typically 30 minutes)\n\r\n• Hours: Flexible, but must overlap with Australian business hours (9am-5pm AEST) for at least 4-5 hours daily\n\r\n• Compensation: dependent on experience, with review after 90 days based on performance\n\r\n• Paid via direct bank transfer monthly\n\r\n• This is a long-term role. We want someone who will grow with the company as we launch additional brands.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow We Work\n\r\nWe’re a small, fast-moving team. The business owner handles creative strategy and advertising. We have editors, a graphic designer, and you’ll be the customer-facing person. Communication happens on Slack. We don’t micromanage — but we do have clear KPIs:\n\r\n• First response time: under 4 hours during business hours\n\r\n• All tickets resolved or escalated by end of day\n\r\n• 100% of Trustpilot reviews responded within 24 hours\n\r\n• Refund rate stays under 5%\n\r\n• Zero freestyle responses — every reply uses an approved macro or template\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll receive comprehensive SOPs, a complete macro library, and full training in the first week. We don’t expect you to figure things out on your own — we expect you to follow the systems we’ve built and flag anything that doesn’t fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Applications that do not follow these instructions will be immediately rejected.\n\r\nTo apply, send a message that includes ALL of the following:\n\r\n1. Start your message with the word \"PINEAPPLE\" so we know you read this entire posting.\n\r\n2. A brief description of your most recent eCommerce customer support role (company name, how long, what tools you used, how many tickets per day).\n\r\n3. Write a sample response to this customer ticket: \"I ordered a Large but I think I need an XL. Can I swap it?\" — Write it in a friendly, casual tone. Do NOT use AI to write this.\n\r\n4. Your available working hours in AEST (Australian Eastern Standard Time).\n\r\n5. Your expected monthly salary in USD.\n\r\nWe review applications within 3 business days.

We’re looking for a dedicated SEO content writer to join our team and focus on writing pillar pages and city/location pages for our clients.\n\r\nYou will work directly alongside our senior content writer, Janice, who handles blog production. Together, you’ll execute a content strategy built around topical authority — pillar pages that establish our clients as the go-to resource in their industry, supported by city/location pages that capture local search traffic.\n\r\nThis is not a blogging role. You will be writing long-form, strategically structured content that serves as the foundation of each client’s SEO strategy.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Be Writing\n\r\nPillar Pages (3,500–5,000 words)\n\r\nThese are comprehensive, authoritative guides on a client’s core topics. Examples: “The Complete Guide to Mobile Surveillance for Construction Sites” or “Everything You Need to Know About Selling Your House for Cash in Houston.” Each pillar page must be thorough enough that Google sees it as the definitive resource on the topic.\n\r\nCity/Location Pages (800–1,200 words)\n\r\nThese target specific service areas for our clients. Examples: “Pergolas and Pavilions in [City, State]” or “Cash Home Buyers in [Neighborhood], Houston.” Each page must be unique — not templated content with the city name swapped out. We need genuine, locally relevant content that ranks.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Day-to-Day\n\r\n ? Receive content briefs from our SEO strategist that include target keywords, keyword hierarchy, internal linking instructions, and content structure\n\r\n ? Use Search Atlas Content Genius to generate initial drafts, then edit and enhance them to publish-ready quality\n\r\n ? Coordinate with Janice to ensure pillar pages and blogs are properly linked and support each other within the content cluster\n\r\n ? Follow our pillar page framework: direct-answer lead sections, comparison content, supporting data, and clear internal linking to cluster blogs\n\r\n ? Deliver content that scores well in Search Atlas’s SEO content scoring\n\r\n \n\r\n\n\r\nTools You’ll Use\n\r\n ? Search Atlas — Content Genius for drafting, topical maps for content planning, SEO scoring for optimization\n\r\n ? Google Docs — Content drafts and collaboration\n\r\n ? Slack — Team communication\n\r\n\n\r\n        •.      \n — task management \n\r\n\n\r\n ? Loom — Training and async walkthroughs\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nMust-Have:\n\r\n ? Strong English writing skills — native-level grammar, spelling, and sentence structure (writing samples required)\n\r\n ? At least 2 years of experience writing SEO content (blogs, service pages, or location pages)\n\r\n ? Understanding of on-page SEO: keyword placement, header structure, meta descriptions, internal linking\n\r\n ? Ability to write long-form content (3,000–5,000 words) that is comprehensive, well-organized, and not fluff\n\r\n ? Comfortable working with AI writing tools as a starting point, then editing and improving the output — not just publishing AI drafts as-is\n\r\n ? Reliable internet connection and available during US business hours (at least 4–5 hours of overlap)\n\r\nNice-to-Have:\n\r\n ? Experience writing for construction, home services, security, or real estate industries\n\r\n ? Familiarity with Search Atlas, Ahrefs, or similar SEO platforms\n\r\n ? Understanding of topical authority, content clusters, and pillar page strategy\n\r\n ? Experience with RankMath or Yoast for on-page SEO optimization\n\r\n ? Familiarity with WordPress publishing\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Makes This Role Different\n\r\nYou won’t be churning out generic blog posts. You’ll be building the strategic content foundation that drives rankings for real businesses. You’ll have a clear content strategy, structured briefs, and the tools to do great work. You’ll collaborate closely with a senior writer who knows the clients well and can help you get up to speed quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe value quality over volume. We’d rather you write one exceptional pillar page than three mediocre ones.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nPlease include the following in your application:\n\r\n 1. Two writing samples — ideally long-form SEO content (pillar pages, guides, or service area pages). Blog posts are okay if you don’t have pillar page samples, but let us know.\n\r\n 2. A short note (3–5 sentences) explaining how you approach writing a pillar page from scratch. What’s your process?.                ",

If you're not ready to move fast, this isn't for you.\n\r\nWe're a 7-figure/year supplement brand that is growing every single month. We need editors who already know what it takes to create ads that actually convert , not people who \"want to learn ecom.\" You should already have experience editing for ecommerce brands, specifically in the supplement or beauty space. That's non-negotiable.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's what we need from you:\n\r\n?? You know AI tools and you're not afraid of them. ElevenLabs, Kling, Veo3, HeyGen, Nano Banana / text-to-image prompting , if you're already using these, you're ahead of the pack. If you're not using all of them yet but you're the type of person who learns new tools in a weekend, we want to talk.\n\r\n\n\r\n?? You've edited ads for ecommerce brands before. Supplement brands, beauty brands, DTC health brands , you've been in this world and you understand what makes a scroll-stopping ad. This is a hard requirement. We're not training someone from zero on what an ecom ad looks like.\n\r\n\n\r\n?? You get work done fast. We're talking 1-2 batches of ads per day, delivered within 24 hours of receiving a brief. A batch might be one full ad. It might be one ad with three hooks. Depends on the brief. Point is , you execute, you don't sit on things.\n\r\n\n\r\n?? You communicate fast on WhatsApp. This is how we operate. You see a message, you respond. Simple.\n\r\n\n\r\n?? You are FLUENT in English. This is a requirement, not a preference. If you also speak Spanish, that's a bonus.\n\r\n\n\r\n?? You're coachable. This is the most important thing on this list. We have systems, we have training videos, we have courses, we have a way of doing things that works. In the beginning, you're going to need a lot of coaching , and that's fine. We don't judge questions here. Ask them. But after your trial phase, you need to be able to run independently without someone holding your hand on every single task. You know when to ask and you know when to execute.\n\r\n\n\r\n?? You're comfortable with how we operate. We hire fast and we fire fast. If you're great, you're going to be heavily incentivized and you're going to grow with a brand that's scaling aggressively. If it's not working, we're not going to drag it out for months , it's better for both of us to figure that out quickly and move on. No hard feelings, no wasted time.\n\r\n\n\r\n?? You genuinely want to get better every single day. This isn't a \"clock in, do the bare minimum, clock out\" situation. We're building something here. If you want to be part of a team that's constantly pushing, constantly improving, and constantly winning , apply. If you just want a gig, don't.\n\r\n\n\r\nTO APPLY, send us your portfolio with examples of ecommerce ads you've edited (supplement or beauty preferred), the AI tools you currently use, and your WhatsApp number. If you don't have ecom ad examples, don't apply.                ",

Our mission is to provide liquidity to homeowners in difficult situations while revitalizing local housing markets through strategic investment.\n\r\nPosition: Cold Caller & Data Entry Specialist\n\r\nWe are seeking a dedicated professional to join our acquisitions team.

Candidates must have a reliable computer (Windows OS preferred) and a stable internet connection.\n\r\n • Resilience: The ability to maintain a high level of energy and professionalism throughout a shift, as cold calling is a numbers-driven activity where \"conversion rates\" are optimized through persistence.\n\r\nCompensation and Schedule\n\r\n • Rate: 57.74 php per hour.\n\r\n • Payment Structure: As an Independent Contractor, you are responsible for your own local taxes and benefits.\n\r\n • Performance Incentives: Potential for bonuses based on the successful closing of deals generated from your leads.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease reply with\n contact and WhatsApp phone number                ",

    "description": "\n                    Customer Success Manager – Marketing Agency | $600 + Commission ($1,500+ Potential)\n\r\n\n\r\nHey — I’m Moe, founder of BYMOE Productions, a marketing agency based out of Boston. I built this company from scratch, went from $40K in debt to approaching seven figures in under a year, and now we serve ~40 local service businesses across the US. I’m not looking for someone who just wants a job. I’m looking for someone who wants to grow with me and eventually lead a team. If that’s you, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Company\n\r\n\n\r\nBYMOE Productions helps local service businesses — contractors, auto shops, med spas, moving companies, PT clinics — generate clients through Instagram advertising and DM automation systems. Our clients stay because we get them real results, not because they’re locked into contracts. That means client experience is everything to us.\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be the primary point of contact for our clients after they onboard. Your job is to make sure every client feels supported, stays on track, and sees results. This is a relationship management role — not a sales role. You’ll be the person our clients trust, and the person I rely on to keep delivery running smoothly.\n\r\n\n\r\nDay-to-day you’ll be responsible for:\n\r\n • Managing all client communication \n, Slack, text, Zoom calls)\n\r\n • Running and preparing for bi-monthly strategy check-in calls with US-based business owners\n\r\n • Tracking client progress, campaign performance, and deliverable timelines\n\r\n • Coordinating between clients and our internal team (video editors, ad managers, automation setup)\n\r\n • Managing onboarding workflows for new clients in Notion\n\r\n • Flagging at-risk clients early and proactively solving problems before they escalate\n\r\n • Maintaining and updating our project management systems (Notion, \n, Calendly)\n\r\n • Documenting SOPs and helping systematize our delivery processes as we scale\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n • $600/month base salary — paid on time, every time\n\r\n • Commission on client retention and upsells — structured so your earnings grow as you perform\n\r\n • Realistic total earnings: $1,500+/month for someone who takes ownership of the role\n\r\n\n\r\nCommission examples:\n\r\n • Maintain a client retention rate above 90% for the month ? retention bonus\n\r\n • Successfully upsell a client to a higher service tier ? per-upsell bonus\n\r\n • Full commission structure shared with qualified candidates during the interview process\n\r\n\n\r\nPayment via Wise or PayPal, your preference.\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\n • 1–2+ years in a client-facing role (account management, customer success, executive VA, or similar). Agency experience is a strong plus, but attitude and communication skills matter most.\n\r\n • Exceptional English — written AND spoken. You’ll be on Zoom calls with American business owners weekly. This is non-negotiable.\n\r\n • Highly organized and detail-oriented. Nothing falls through the cracks with you.\n\r\n • Proactive, not reactive. You anticipate problems before they become fires.\n\r\n • Comfortable with tools like Notion, Google Workspace, Slack, Zoom, and Calendly — or willing to learn fast.\n\r\n • Familiarity with digital marketing concepts (Meta ads, Instagram, funnels) is a plus but not required. We’ll train you on our systems.\n\r\n • Emotionally intelligent. You know how to manage a frustrated client, celebrate a win, and read between the lines.\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n • Reliable laptop/computer and headset with a microphone\n\r\n • Stable internet connection (minimum 25 Mbps)\n\r\n • Quiet workspace for client-facing Zoom calls\n\r\n • Available to work 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM US Eastern Time, Monday through Friday\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Work With Us\n\r\n • Direct access to the founder. No middle management. Your ideas and contributions matter from day one.\n\r\n • Real growth path. This role has a clear trajectory to Team Lead or Operations Manager as we scale. I want to promote from within.\n\r\n • A company that’s actually growing. We’ve gone from 0 to ~40 clients in under a year and we’re just getting started.\n\r\n • We actually care about results. Our clients include businesses that have booked $1.2M+ in projects and achieved 6X return on ad spend through our systems. You’ll be part of something that works.\n\r\n • 13th month pay + PH holidays observed. We respect your time and culture.\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nStart your application with the word “BLUEPRINT” so I know you read the full listing. Applications that don’t include this will be skipped.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application, please include:\n\r\n 1. A short intro — who you are, where you’re based, and why this role caught your eye\n\r\n 2. Your relevant experience — specifically around managing client relationships or accounts\n\r\n 3. Answer this question: “Describe a time you saved a client relationship that was at risk. What happened and what did you do?”\n\r\n 4. BONUS (not required but will put you at the top of the list): A 2–3 minute Loom video introducing yourself\n\r\n\n\r\nI review every application personally. If you’re the right fit, you’ll hear fro\n within 48 hours.\n\r\n\n\r\n— Moe                ",

I am a solo founder building a US-based technology startup called DearlySent. We are building a social relationship network designed to bridge the gap between digital intention and physical action. My goal over the next decade is to serve 100 million monthly active users and fundamentally change the way human beings show care and love to one another.\n\r\n\n\r\nI personally work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, and I absolutely love what I do. I am intensely driven, but I cannot scale this alone. I am looking for my right-hand partner. I am looking for someone with high fluid intelligence, deep empathy, and a builder’s mindset to join me on the ground floor.\n\r\n\n\r\n**My Promise to You (The Anti-Micromanagement Guarantee):**\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a daycare. You are an adult, and you will be treated as a peer and a partner.\n\r\n\n\r\n- I will **never** use Time Doctor, Hubstaff, or any screen-recording software.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- I will **never** force you to punch a clock.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- I do not want your mechanical hours; I want your mind, your heart, and your soul. We will work in symbiosis to build something incredible. I care about output, execution, and trust.\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\n**The Trajectory & Compensation (The 4-Month Ramp):**\n\r\n\n\r\nI do not pay hourly, because I do not want you to have \"hours anxiety.\" If you build a system that saves us 10 hours a week, you should not be penalized with less pay. I pay a stable monthly salary for your output and ownership. We will scale your salary and your responsibilities together over the first four months:\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Month 1 (The Foundation): $800 USD / month.** Expectation is roughly 20 hours of focused output a week. You will learn the DNA of the company, help with Ritz-Carlton level customer care, execute rigorous QA testing of our app, and build our initial operations tracking.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Month 2 (The Builder): $1,200 USD / month.** Expectation grows to ~30 hours a week. You take over affiliate outreach, competitor research, manage video creators, and build our Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Month 3 (The Operator): $1,600 USD / month.** Nearing full-time. You take over daily operations so I can focus purely on engineering and marketing. You manage the digital fulfillment prep and own customer support.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Month 4+ (The Partner): $2,000 USD / month.** Full-time ownership. You are officially my Chief of Staff. You manage the systems, and when we are task-saturated and need to hire more people, _you_ will lead the interviews.\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\n**Long-Term Respect & Benefits:**\n\r\n\n\r\n- **13th Month Pay:** I proudly and proactively pay the 13th-month bonus every December.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Healthcare:** Once you reach Month 4 (Full Partner status), you will receive an additional $50/month stipend specifically for your local HMO.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Growth:** A guaranteed minimum 5% annual pay raise, with room for much higher performance-based increases as the company's revenue scales.\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\n**Who You Are:**\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Flawless English:** You will be communicating with our premium US customer base and directly with me.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Empathetic:** You actually care about people. Our company exists to remind people of their value.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **A Systems Thinker:** You don't just solve a problem; you build a system so the problem never happens again.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Tech-Savvy:** You embrace AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to make yourself faster and smarter.\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n### **How to Apply (The 3-Phase Hiring Process):**\n\r\n\n\r\nTo find the perfect partner, I do not read generic cover letters. We are breaking this process into three phases to ensure we are a perfect fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n**PHASE 1: The Introduction**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a resume or a cover letter. Instead, record a 3-to-5 minute video (Loom, YouTube, etc.) answering these three exact questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Explain a complex technical or operational problem you solved in the past.\n\r\n    \n\r\n2. Tell me about a specific act of kindness you’ve done for someone recently, or something kind you would like to do for someone.\n\r\n    \n\r\n3. What is a piece of technology or software that you believe is perfectly engineered, and why?\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\nAttention to Detail Check: Please make the subject line of your application message: \"Generosity: [Your Name]\" so I know you read this entire post).\n\r\nApplications without videos will be immediately deleted and not reviewed.  \n\r\n\n\r\n**PHASE 2: The Deep Dive**\n\r\n\n\r\nI will review every single video. The top candidates will be invited to Round 2, where I will ask you to record a second video detailing your specific background, your career ambitions, and more personal details about who you are. \n\r\n\n\r\n**PHASE 3: The Paid Trial**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe top finalists will be paid $50 USD to complete a real-world practice project for our company and take a brief alignment/personality assessment. You will be actively encouraged to use AI to complete this project.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe final candidate will be offered the position immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want to just clock in, do data entry, and clock out, please do not apply. If you want to build a unicorn startup, take ownership of a mission, and grow into a tech executive, send me your video. Let's build something incredible together.                ",

APPLICATIONS WITHOUT AUDIO WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.]\n\r\n\n\r\nJOB SUMMARY:\n\r\n\n\r\nZippy Dumpster is expanding, and we are looking for a highly motivated, razor-sharp Sales & Operations Specialist to own our after-hours and weekend lead flow, as we generate a significant volume of high-intent leads during evenings and weekends.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere is the best part: We do not require prior experience. We are hiring strictly for attitude, personality, and raw intelligence. If you are a naturally friendly, teachable person who learns quickly, we will train you on absolutely everything related to the job. Your immediate mission is speed to lead: responding to incoming inquiries instantly, building great rapport, and closing deals while our competitors are offline. As you master the inbound flow, this role will expand to include outbound lead generation—giving you direct control over your earning potential through our commission structure. Our business is nuanced, so you will also be fully trained in the operational side—from customer service, logistics, and billing to the specific service areas and nuances of dumpster sizes, weight limits, and prohibited materials.\n\r\n\n\r\nWORKING HOURS & EXPECTATIONS:\n\r\n\n\r\nTarget Schedule: Specific weekdays from approximately mid-afternoon to late evening (LA/Pacific Time) and Weekends from approximately late morning to early evening (LA/Pacific Time). Exact hours will be finalized during the hiring process.\n\r\n\n\r\nPacing: While current lead volume during these hours is growing, we are prepared to significantly scale our marketing to keep you busy as you ramp up.\n\r\n\n\r\nResponsiveness: Immediate response times to inbound leads are mandatory.\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION & UPSIDE:\n\r\n\n\r\nBase Salary: $5.00 USD per hour\n\r\n\n\r\nPerformance Bonuses: A generous commission and bonus structure will be implemented based on sales and lead conversions. While we are currently focused on inbound leads, we will be incorporating outbound lead generation into this role, making this position highly lucrative for a top performer with the drive to close.\n\r\n\n\r\nJOB RESPONSIBILITIES:\n\r\n\n\r\nRapid Lead Conversion: Act as the first point of contact for after-hours and weekend leads. Respond immediately, provide accurate quotes, and convert inquiries into scheduled deliveries.\n\r\n\n\r\nFollow-Up: Follow up with potential customers, and build a pipeline to ensure maximum conversion rates.\n\r\n\n\r\nMaster Operations: Learn and execute all operational duties alongside sales, including scheduling, customer service, billing, and coordinating with our drivers.\n\r\n\n\r\nRetain Complex Knowledge: Understand and clearly communicate the complicated nuances of our services, including the specifics of various dumpster sizes and what materials are allowed or prohibited.\n\r\n\n\r\nJOB REQUIREMENTS:\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience: None required. We are looking for the right person, not the right resume.\n\r\n\n\r\nAttitude & Personality: You must have a fantastic, upbeat personality, a great attitude, and be highly coachable. You are the voice of our company.\n\r\n\n\r\nCognitive Ability: You must be highly intelligent, adaptable, and a phenomenally quick learner.\n\r\n\n\r\nLanguage: Exceptional (Native or C1/C2 level) verbal and written English fluency is mandatory.\n\r\n\n\r\nOUR INTERVIEW PROCESS\n\r\nWe are looking for someone sharp, and our interview process reflects that. To ensure a mutual fit, our process includes:\n\r\n\n\r\nThe \"Meet & Greet\" (Social Interview): A brief, conversational interview to get to know you, assess your English fluency, and ensure your personality is a great fit for our team.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe \"Deep Dive\" (Technical Interview): A rigorous 45 min session where we will teach you some nuances of our business, including dumpster sizing and operational rules.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Knowledge Test: At the end of the Deep Dive, you will be tested on the information we just taught you to see how quickly and accurately you absorb complex details.

I’m looking for an Executive Assistant who can handle the daily operations of my business and personal life.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Reality: I don’t have time to manage you. If I have to chase you for an update, explain a task twice, or worry about whether you’re actually working during your shift, you aren’t the right fit.

If you need help, you ask after you’ve tried to solve it yourself.\n\r\n\n\r\nEssentially, you manage the details so I can focus on growth. You don't wait for me to ask you to do something, you're proactive and do it yourself. \n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\n- This role is specifically for a female EA.\n\r\n- You are hyper-organized and tech-savvy (AI, Meta Ads, GoHighLevel, Airtable).\n\r\n- You communicate clearly, concisely, and immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Be Responsible For\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll help run both my business and personal operations, including but not limited to:\n\r\n\n\r\nOperations & Admin\n\r\n- Managing my calendar, scheduling/rescheduling meetings\n\r\n- Keeping me organized and on top of priorities\n\r\n- Handling personal tasks when needed (travel planning, logistics, etc.)\n\r\n\n\r\nMarketing & Client Support\n\r\n- Scheduling\ns and social media posts\n\r\n- Assisting with funnel building (GoHighLevel, landing pages, automations)\n\r\n- Building ad campaigns from detailed briefs (Meta Ads)\n\r\n- Writing or improving copy (using AI when appropriate)\n\r\n- Setting up ad accounts, campaigns, and retargeting flows\n\r\n\n\r\nFinance & Tracking\n\r\n- Tracking client payments, team payouts, and commissions\n\r\n- Updating Airtable/Google Sheets with accurate numbers ASAP\n\r\n- Creating simple weekly reports (cash collected, payouts, etc.)\n\r\n\n\r\nGrowth Support\n\r\n- Helping find new clients (DMs,\n outreach, research)\n\r\n- Supporting client work with my partners\n\r\n- Uploading data, sales calls, and notes into AI systems for insights\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Application Process (Read Carefully):\n\r\nDo not send me a generic resume. To apply, you must send a video or write a short paragraph explaining:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Why you are the perfect fit for this role compared to everyone else.\n\r\n2. An example of a time you took ownership of a task so well that your boss didn't have to think about it again.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you don't include this, I won't read your application.                ",
