We interview everyday golfers on the course and at driving ranges, and we need a dedicated video editor to turn our raw interview footage into short-form clips for Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts.\n\r\nThis is a long-term, ongoing position — not a one-time project. You will be our full-time editor.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU WILL BE EDITING:\n\r\nInterview Clips (Primary — 80% of the work)\n\r\nWe film 3-10 minute on-course interviews with real golfers. You will watch the raw footage, take each of my questions and their answers and turn them into a video clip. Of course edit them into polished short-form clips, with proper on screen hooks, sound, and cuts in and out to keep the viewer engaged. Each full clip interview typically produces 2-6 clips. We film weekly and have a large backlog, so there is no shortage of footage. We also want to start posting long form YouTube videos of our days at the golf course interviewing golfers.... \n\r\n\n\r\nExamples of creator videos on TikTok we like is Caleb \n \n Product Ads (20% of the work)\n\r\nWe also film product reaction videos where we hand golfers a product (gloves, drinks, gear) and capture their honest reactions. These need to be edited in the style of StreetTalk \n on Instagram) — fast-paced, authentic, with strong hooks.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT EACH CLIP NEEDS:\n\r\nBold animated captions throughout (CapCut-style, white text with dark outline, key words highlighted in a brand color)\n\r\nA text hook in the first 2-3 seconds that creates curiosity and stops the scroll\n\r\nJump cuts to remove dead air, filler words, and pauses\n\r\nClean audio (reduce wind and background noise when needed)\n\r\nBrand watermark in bottom right corner with our logo and handle (we will provide)\n\r\nVertical 9:16 format, optimized for mobile\n\r\nLight background music for street interview product ads that does not overpower the conversation and likely no background on our typical interview videos of golfers. \n\r\n\n\r\nOccasional B-roll inserts when necessary or makes sense. minimal use of AI B-roll please. \n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE DO NOT WANT:\n\r\nCheesy transitions, flashy effects, or over-editing\n\r\nContent that feels like a commercial — it should feel real and authentic\n\r\nInaccurate captions or missing words\n\r\n\n\r\nVOLUME:\n\r\nWe need approximately 3 finished clips per day (roughly 15-20 per week, 60-90 per month). You will receive raw footage in batches and manage your own schedule to hit daily output.\n\r\n\n\r\nTOOLS:\n\r\nCapCut, Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, or Final Cut — we do not have a preference as long as the output quality is consistent. You must be able to add animated/dynamic captions natively (not just static subtitles).\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT MAKES A GREAT FIT:\n\r\nYou have edited interview-style or podcast-style short-form content before\n\r\nYou understand pacing — you know which \nnts to keep and which to cut\n\r\nYou can write short, punchy text hooks that make people stop scrolling\n\r\nYou are reliable and communicative — if something comes up, you tell us before a deadline is missed\n\r\nYou watch short-form content yourself and understand what performs on Reels/TikTok\n\r\n\n\r\nTO APPLY:\n\r\nPlease include a link to 2-3 examples of short-form clips you have edited (interview or conversation style preferred). Again you can reference our socials \n to better understand what we do so you can send clips that are close to that.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you do not have interview-style samples, send your best short-form work and we will provide a paid test clip ($10) before making a decision.

    "description": "\n                    # Tech Stack Implementation Lead \n\r\nWe're standing up our entire operational tech stack from scratch — CRM,\n outreach infrastructure, enrichment pipelines, automation workflows, and website — and need someone to drive implementation across a distributed technical team.\n\r\n\n\r\n## The Situation\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have the people and the plan. There's a defined project spanning 8 workstreams with clear ownership assignments across multiple technical tea\nmbers. You would be \"the someone\" making sure it all comes together on time, in the right order, without things breaking each other. \n\r\n\n\r\n## What You'll Own\n\r\n\n\r\nDriving the tech stack buildout from current state to fully operational. That means running the Asana board daily — are tasks moving, are blockers surfaced, are dependencies respected (you can't start\n sequences before warm-up completes, DNS changes can't break\n while the website migrates). You'll coordinate across tea\nmbers who don't overlap in hours, run lightweight async standups, and be the person who catches integration issues early — like Clay outputs not mapping correctly to CRM fields, or outreach domains missing DKIM records.\n\r\n\n\r\n## The Workstreams You'd Coordinate\n\r\n\n\r\n- CRM evaluation and setup (HubSpot or alternative)\n\r\n- LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Apollo configuration\n\r\n- Clay enrichment waterfall and\n verification pipeline\n\r\n- Instantly cold\n setup and domain warm-up\n\r\n- n8n automation deployment and workflow building\n\r\n- WordPress website migration and hardening\n\r\n- Slack/M365/Loom workspace configuration\n\r\n\n\r\nYou don't need to do the hands-on technical work, but you need to understand it well enough to know whether it's done right.\n\r\n\n\r\n## What We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nSomeone who's coordinated technical implementations before — SaaS rollouts, CRM migrations, marketing automation builds, or similar. You understand what SPF/DKIM records are, why\n warm-up takes 2-3 weeks, what an API integration means in practice, and how to tell if a WordPress site is properly secured. You live in project management tools (Asana preferred) and communicate clearly in writing. You're comfortable pushing back when timelines slip and escalating when something needs a decision.\n\r\n\n\r\n## Nice to Have\n\r\n\n\r\n- Direct experience with any of our stack: HubSpot, Clay, Instantly, n8n, Apollo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator\n\r\n- Background in B2B lead generation or outreach operations\n\r\n- Experience managing remote teams across time zones\n\r\n\n\r\n##What We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\nRemote, 20 hours/week with flexibility to scale up during peak implementation phases. You'd report directly to the founder and have full visibility into every technical workstream. This is a high-leverage role.\n\r\n\n\r\nGrowth path: This isn't a static role. We're a growing company and we invest in people who invest in us. As the tech stack matures, this role evolves — from implementation coordination into ongoing technical operations management, systems optimization, and potentially leading a larger technical team. We support upskilling (tool certifications, new platforms, expanded scope) and adjust compensation as your responsibilities grow. If you're someone who wants to learn, take ownership, and grow with a company rather than just fill a seat, we want to talk to you.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply\n\r\nPlease include the following in your application. Incomplete applications will not be reviewed.\n\r\n1. Subject line: \"TSIL - [Your Name]\"\n\r\n2. Brief intro (3-5 sentences max): What's the most complex technical implementation you've coordinated? What tools were involved, how many people, and what was the outcome?\n\r\n3. Answer these three questions:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou notice that a tea\nmber configured DKIM records for the outreach domains but skipped DMARC. The\n warm-up is scheduled to start tomorrow. What do you do and why does it matter?\n\r\nTwo workstreams are about to collide: the WordPress developer is migrating the site to a new server on Monday, and the ops coordinator is switching MX records for Microsoft 365\n the same day. How do you handle this?\n\r\nA tea\nmber marks a task \"complete\" in Asana but you suspect it wasn't fully done (e.g., \"Set up Clay enrichment tables\" is marked done but no QA was performed). What's your process?\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Availability & rate:\n\r\n\n\r\nConfirm you can commit to 20 hrs/week with the ability to scale up as needed\n\r\nYour expected hourly rate in USD\n\r\nYour typical working hours and timezone\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Loom or short video (optional but strongly preferred): Record a 2-3 minute walkthrough of a project you managed in Asana, Trello, Monday, or any PM tool. Show us how you organized it and tracked progress. This doesn't need to be polished — we want to see how you think.                ",
