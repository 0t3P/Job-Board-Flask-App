    "description": "\n                    We’re a fast-growing DTC CPG brand looking for an EOS-style Operator to help turn the founder's vision into execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT a Project Manager or Executive Assistant job. It’s a hybrid Chief of Staff/ Integrator role — ideal for someone who can think strategically and roll up their sleeves as we scale.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU WILL OWN\n\r\n1. Operational Leadership\n\r\n- Translate founder notes, ideas, and strategic priorities into structured projects with clear owners and timelines.\n\r\n- Manage and coordinate our 12+ agencies/contractors (Meta ads, Amazon PPC, Walmart, TikTok - Shop, Socials, Amazon VA, Supply Chain, Retention Marketing, etc.).\n\r\n- Diagnose underperformance and recommend solutions (augment, hire, fire, restructure).\n\r\n- Maintain weekly operating cadence so nothing slips through the cracks.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. EOS-Style Integrator Work\n\r\n- Prioritize what truly matters and shield the founder from noise.\n\r\n- Make judgment calls independently when the founder is offline.\n\r\n- Push back on agencies, ask strategic questions, and ensure work aligns with our quarterly goals/Rocks.\n\r\n- Connect dots across marketing, ops, supply chain, and product so we stay aligned.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Systems Builder / OS Architect\n\r\n- Build Version 1.0 of our operating system: workflows, SOPs, decision trees, accountability lanes.\n\r\n- Turn ambiguous initiatives (new SKUs, new channels, new markets) into clear project plans.\n\r\n- Continuously refine processes — you see broken systems before they break.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Founder Enablement\n\r\n- Protect the founder’s attention by clarifying next steps, eliminating friction, and closing loops.\n\r\n- Light coordination, no heavy inbox or calendar management.\n\r\n- Proactively remove blockers and reduce decision fatigue.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHERE IS THIS ROLE TODAY\n\r\nHands-on operational leadership. Turning chaos into clarity. Structuring founder ideas. Building processes from scratch. Running and optimizing our agency ecosystem. Owning execution across channels.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHERE THIS ROLE EVOLVES (6- 12 Months)\n\r\nAs systems mature and a PM/EA layer is added beneath you, this becomes a true Integrator seat:\n\r\n- Running L10s\n\r\n- Owning Scorecards\n\r\n- Driving Rocks\n\r\n- Leading cross-functional accountability\n\r\n- Supporting strategic planning\n\r\n- You will play a key role in shaping that evolution.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO YOU ARE\n\r\n- High judgment — You know what matters vs. noise and escalate only when needed.\n\r\n- Proactive & self-directed — You don’t wait to be told; you anticipate issues.\n\r\n- Founder-level ownership — You think like an operator, not a task-taker.\n\r\n- Structured thinker — You bring clarity to a messy, fast-moving environment.\n\r\n- Strong communicator — Crisp writing, strong updates, comfortable pushing back.\n\r\n- High-output — You move at founder pace and close loops quickly.\n\r\n- Calm under pressure — Fast-growth e-commerce doesn’t rattle you.\n\r\n- AI-native — You use AI daily for drafting, summarizing, automating, and systemizing.\n\r\n- E-commerce experience is helpful but not required for high-judgment operators with strong systems thinking.

    "description": "\n                    I am a university student in Japan (majoring in Science/AI). \n\r\nI have the technical foundation to build AI automation and workflows, but I have one fatal weakness: \n\r\nI am not good at sales, and I hate cold outreach.\n\r\n\n\r\nI am trying to build a long-term freelance agency (Guild), and I am looking for a reliable right-hand partner. I am not looking for a one-off gig worker. I want someone who wants to build a long-term career and eventually take over the day-to-day operations of the agency.\n\r\n\n\r\nMaster Plan (Year 1 and Beyond):\n\r\n\n\r\nYear 1 (Co-op Mode):\n\r\nYou will be the \"Frontman\". Find clients on Upwork or LinkedIn who need help with AI and automation. \n\r\nI will pay a guaranteed fixed hourly rate for all the time you spend researching, sending proposals, and doing outreach. \n\r\nWhen you get a client, I step in. I build the technical solution, you handle the client communication in English, and we deliver it together. We will then share the commission/bonus from the project.\n\r\n\n\r\nYear 2+ (Your Agency):\n\r\nNext year, I will transition to a corporate role in Japan and step back from day-to-day operations. \n\r\nMy goal is for YOU to manage the knowledge, client relationships, and systems we built in Year 1. Ultimately, you will run this agency.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I offer:\n\r\n* Financial Security & Upside: A stable hourly rate for your outreach work, plus a high commission rate when we close deals. \n\r\n* Honest Partnership: I won't pretend to be a Silicon Valley billionaire. I am a student trying to build something real. Let's learn, fail, and succeed together.\n\r\n* A Long-term Home: I want the skills and templates you develop to be the foundation of our long-term business.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\n* Excellent English reading, writing, and speaking skills.\n\r\n* Thick skin: You must be okay with being ignored or rejected on Upwork.\n\r\n* Interest in AI/Automation (You don't need to be an engineer, but you must be willing to learn the concepts).\n\r\n* Looking for a stable, long-term relationship (1+ years).\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply (PLEASE READ CAREFULLY):\n\r\nDo NOT just send a generic application. I want to understand how you think. \n\r\nTo apply, please send a message through OnlineJobs.ph and include the following:\n\r\n1. Put the word \"GUILD\" at the very top of your message.\n\r\n2. Answer this: What is your past experience with Upwork, BPO, or Lead Generation?\n\r\n3. Answer this: Why are you interested in this \"Apprentice to Agency Owner\" transition plan?\n\r\n\n\r\n(Generic applications without the word \"GUILD\" and the answers will be ignored.)

We have had developers before who could build things technically but had no sense of layout, visual hierarchy, or aesthetic. That is not what we are looking for. If you cannot look at a design and immediately understand the vision, this is not the role for you.\n\r\nYou will be working directly with our creative director to bring Figma and Illustrator designs to life on Webflow. You need to be able to take a desktop layout and translate it perfectly to mobile with proper responsive breakpoints, collapsible navigation, dropdown menus, and mobile-optimized interactions — not just shrink the desktop version and call it done.\n\r\nThis is a long-term role with a growing agency. If you are the right person, there is consistent work and room to grow with us.\n\r\nResponsibilities:\n\r\n\n\r\nBuild and maintain Webflow websites from Figma or static design files\n\r\nDevelop fully responsive layouts across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints\n\r\nImplement animations, scroll interactions, hover effects, and motion design within Webflow\n\r\nBuild dropdown navigation, collapsible menus, and interactive UI components\n\r\nEnsure pixel-perfect translation from design to live site\n\r\nCollaborate closely with the creative director — you will be expected to understand the vision, not just execute instructions blindly\n\r\nMaintain clean, organized class structures and CMS collections\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\n\n\r\nExpert-level Webflow — this is non-negotiable. Do not apply if Webflow is not your primary tool\n\r\nStrong understanding of HTML and CSS — you need to know what is happening under the hood\n\r\nProven ability to build responsive, mobile-first layouts with proper breakpoint management\n\r\nExperience with Webflow interactions and animations (scroll-triggered, hover, entrance animations, etc.)\n\r\nA strong portfolio that shows design sensibility — we want to see sites that look good, not just function\n\r\nAbility to read and work from Figma files\n\r\nUnderstanding of visual hierarchy, spacing, typography, and layout — you do not need to be a graphic designer but you need to think like one\n\r\nReliable internet connection and a capable computer setup\n\r\nStrong communicator — you need to be able to ask the right questions and flag issues proactively\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat will get you rejected immediately:\n\r\n\n\r\nA portfolio full of generic, template-looking sites\n\r\nNo demonstrated understanding of responsive design\n\r\nApplying without a portfolio\n\r\nSaying you know Webflow but your work looks like it was built on a free website builder\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this is you please\n me at \n or on WhatsApp at \nWAGE/SALARY: $6–$10/hour\n\r\nDESIRED HOURS PER WEEK: 35\n\r\nSKILLS: Webflow, Figma, HTML, CSS\n\r\n\n\r\n?? Please read before applying:\n\r\nI am looking for a Webflow Developer only. I am not looking for a Virtual Assistant, WordPress developer, or general IT person. If Webflow is not something you use regularly and confidently, do not apply. I will not respond to applications without a portfolio. Generic messages will be ignored.                ",

The work needs to be completed each morning once Xero has updated overnight. As long as the work is done and I can see results, the exact timing within the morning window is flexible.\n\r\n•Service window: 8:00am - 10:00am AEST (approximate)\n\r\n•Flexibility within that window based on workload\n\r\n•What matters: work is complete, accurate, and I can see the results\n\r\n•No micromanagement of hours if outcomes are delivered\n\r\n\n\r\nPrimary Values\n\r\n\n\r\nHighest Standards : Every figure is correct. Every reconciliation balances. Every statement is accurate. No sloppy work, no assumptions, no 'it's probably right'.\n\r\n\n\r\nOwnership: You own the numbers. If something doesn't balance, you find out why. If a payment is missing, you chase it. You don't wait to be told there's a problem.\n\r\n\n\r\nDeliver Results:  The work gets done every morning. Reports are ready when needed. Queries are resolved, not parked. Outcomes matter more than hours logged.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n1 Accounts Receivable Generate and send all client invoices across multiple entities via Xero. Ensure accuracy of amounts, services, and client details. Chase overdue payments.\n\r\n2 Accounts Payable Process supplier invoices, verify against purchase orders or approvals, schedule payments, and maintain accurate creditor records.\n\r\n3 Debt Collection Actively chase outstanding debts. Request and follow up on statements. Resolve queries promptly. Escalate aged debt as per agreed thresholds.\n\r\n4 Bank Reconciliation Reconcile all bank accounts daily once Xero updates. Identify and resolve discrepancies. No unmatched transactions left unaddressed.\n\r\n5 Multi-Entity Management Manage accounts across Australian and UAE entities. Maintain clean separation between entities. Ensure intercompany transactions are properly recorded.\n\r\n6 Statement Requests Request statements from suppliers and debtors as needed. Confirm balances. Identify and resolve any discrepancies between records.\n\r\n7 Query Resolution Respond to and resolve queries from clients, suppliers, and internal stakeholders. Don't let queries sit. Own them until resolved.\n\r\n8 Financial Statements Prepare monthly Profit & Loss and Balance Sheet for each entity. Ensure statements are accurate, complete, and delivered by agreed deadlines.\n\r\n9 Month-End Close Complete month-end close procedures. Ensure all transactions are posted, accruals are recorded, and accounts are ready for reporting.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nEssential\n\r\n•Strong Xero experience (this is non-negotiable)\n\r\n•Experience managing accounts for multiple entities\n\r\n•Ability to prepare financial statements (P&L, Balance Sheet)\n\r\n•Experience with accounts receivable, accounts payable, and bank reconciliation\n\r\n•Comfortable chasing payments and resolving queries professionally\n\r\n•Reliable internet and quiet workspace\n\r\n•Available within the 8:00am - 10:00am AEST service window\n\r\nDesirable\n\r\n•Accounting qualification (CPA, CA, or equivalent)\n\r\n•Experience with Australian accounting standards (UAE experience a plus)\n\r\n•Experience in a services or professional services business\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\r\n•Bank accounts reconciled daily, no unexplained items\n\r\n•Invoices sent on time and accurately\n\r\n•Debts chased proactively, not aged silently\n\r\n•Queries resolved, not parked\n\r\n•Financial statements ready when needed, accurate and complete\n\r\n•I can see results each morning without having to ask\n\r\n•Problems flagged early, not discovered later\n\r\nThe Non-Negotiables\n\r\n•Accuracy is everything.

    "description": "\n                    We're building something most businesses haven't even realised is possible.\n\r\n\n\r\nPet Let is an Australian holiday rental company that's been operating since 2009. We have a large property portfolio, a team across two countries, and a database of more than 13,000 guests.\n\r\nAnd we're in the middle of building a fully AI-powered operation.\n\r\nNot chatbots. Not auto-replies. A genuine network of AI agents that can run core business functions — guest communications, operations coordination, financial processing, reporting, and marketing — with a lean human team providing oversight and handling what genuinely needs human judgment.\n\r\nWe have a diverse tech stack including a property management system, a property operations and task management platform, trust accounting software, and Google Workspace as our communications and data backbone. Your job is to connect all of it to Claude, and build agents and dashboards on top of those connections that make the whole business smarter and faster.\n\r\nWe know where we're going. We need someone to help us get there.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat the role looks like:\n\r\nYou'll work directly with our CEO and Operations Manager. You'll design, build, and deploy — hands on, every day.  You ask questions, dig deep, can understand business processes.  You think and understand fast.  \n\r\n\n\r\nThe work has two major pillars:\n\r\nAI agents — using MCP servers to connect Claude directly to our business systems, then building agents that can act autonomously across those systems: receiving inputs, making decisions, triggering actions, and closing the loop without a human in the middle.\n\r\n\n\r\nLive dashboards — building real-time operational and business dashboards that give leadership and each team a clear view of what's happening and what needs attention. You choose the right tool for the job.\n\r\n\n\r\nBeyond that, the roadmap is broad and the problems are real. You'll have genuine ownership of meaningful work from day one.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho we're looking for\n\r\nYou live in Claude. You've shipped Claude Artifacts. You use Claude Cowork and Code daily and you love letting it do the heavy lifting while you direct the outcome.  Clawdbot/Moltbot/OpenClaw blew your mind.  And now the hype is over, you get what the future looks like and you want to ride that wave.  \n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand MCP — ideally you've built MCP servers and you get why they're the key to turning Claude from an assistant into an agent that can actually act in real systems.\n\r\nYou know Python. You can read an API and build a connection. You've built dashboards that pull live data and help people make decisions.\n\r\nYou don't need to be managed. You need a clear problem and the trust to solve it.\n\r\nHonestly? We're looking for someone who gets so excited about this stuff that the idea of locking yourself away with your favourite drink, your favourite snacks, and a massive problem to solve sounds less like work and more like the best possible way to spend a day. Our CEO is currently losing sleep because she's so energised by what's possible. We want someone who gets that feeling.\n\r\n\n\r\nNon-negotiable:\n\r\n\n\r\nFluent in Python\n\r\nDeep, daily Claude user — Artifacts, Claude Code, the works\n\r\nUnderstands and has worked with MCP\n\r\nHas built things with the Claude or OpenAI API and can show us\n\r\nCan build interactive dashboards connected to live data\n\r\nStrong written English\n\r\nSelf-directed and genuinely motivated by this technology\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong advantage:\n\r\n\n\r\nGoogle Workspace API experience\n\r\nWorkflow automation (n8n, Make, Zapier)\n\r\nExperience with agentic frameworks\n\r\nAny background in hospitality, property management, or operational businesses\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the salary — let's be straight with you\n\r\nWe're starting at $800–$1,200 USD/month. We'll be honest about why: we've been burnt before by people who interview well but can't execute. So we start cautious.\n\r\nBut here's the flip side. If you can do what this ad describes — if you can take our vision and actually ship it, fast — your value to us goes up dramatically and your rate will reflect that. We'll review your compensation as soon as the first element of the vision is live and working, which could be within the first two weeks. After that, regular reviews tied directly to progress.\n\r\nWe're not looking for someone to pay minimally and keep there. We're looking for someone who proves they're exceptional and then gets rewarded for it. If that's you, this is a very good opportunity.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we offer\n\r\n\n\r\nContract  — 40 hours/week\n\r\nBonus\n\r\nStarting remuneration of $800–$1,200 USD/month with fast review based on delivery\n\r\nDirect access to decision-makers — no layers, no bureaucracy\n\r\nReal ownership of a genuinely ambitious project\n\r\nA business that is all-in on this and moving fast\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply\n\r\nSend us three things:\n\r\n\n\r\nWho you are and why this excites you — keep it honest and specific\n\r\nSomething you've built using Claude or another AI API — a link, a repo, a demo, a description. Show us how you think and what you ship\n\r\nYour answer to this: If you were connecting Claude to a business system via MCP, what's the first tool you'd expose and why?\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications without examples of real work will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nPet Let has been making holidays better for pet owners since 2009. We think AI is about to let us do that at a level that simply wasn't possible before. Come help us build it.\n\r\n\n                ",

You will bridge the gap between high-level strategy and daily execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nFull-Stack Web & SEO:\n\r\nTake complete ownership of website management, ensuring all digital properties are high-performing, secure, and aggressively optimized for search engines to drive organic growth.\n\r\n\n\r\nAutomation & Systems:\n\r\nImplement and manage complex workflows within GoHighLevel and other scheduling platforms. You will be expected to find efficiencies in every process to reduce manual overhead.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Integration:\n\r\nLeverage AI as a force multiplier for content ideation, data analysis, and efficiency without sacrificing the \"human touch\" or brand authenticity.\n\r\n\n\r\nMulti-Channel Marketing:\n\r\nSeamlessly pivot between digital ad spend, social media engagement, and traditional print marketing materials to create a cohesive brand experience.\n\r\nTechnical & Professional Requirements\n\r\nSkill Category Requirement\n\r\nMarketing Mastery 3-5 years in Digital & Print marketing with a portfolio of successful social media campaigns.\n\r\nSystems & CRM Professional proficiency in GoHighLevel (funnels, workflows, snapshots) and content schedulers.\n\r\nWeb & SEO Proven ability to fully manage CMS platforms (WordPress/Wix/GHL) and execute technical SEO audits.\n\r\nAutomation Mindset Demonstrated experience building automated lead-gen or nurture sequences.\n\r\nThe \"Edge\" (Coding) Basic to intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript to customize web elements and integrations.\n\r\nAI Literacy Ability to use AI for efficiency while maintaining high-quality, non-generic output.\n\r\nWhy This Role is Unique\n\r\n\n\r\nWe aren't looking for a \"virtual assistant\" to simply check off tasks.
