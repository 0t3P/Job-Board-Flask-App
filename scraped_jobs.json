To be considered,\n your CV to: \n with the following:\n\n\n\nProof of Experience: Provide a written referral or case study for 3 past employers or projects where you successfully grew a social presence or generated B2B leads.\n\n\n\nThe Comparison: Briefly explain the main difference in \"tone\" you would use when messaging a CEO in London vs. a Business Owner in Dubai.\n\n\n\nThe Infiltration: Identify two specific LinkedIn groups (one UK, one UAE) that would be high-value for an AI Automation agency to find clients.\n\n\n\nThe Bridge: A prospect in a group asks: \"I have too many leads and I can't keep up with the follow-up. Any advice?\" Write the 2-sentence comment you would post to get their attention without sounding like a salesman.                ",

Our flagship basketball debate brand, KingVsAir, is rapidly expanding its daily output. We are looking for a hungry, detail-oriented AI Content Creator and Community Manager who lives and breathes US basketball culture and can execute a strict, high-volume content formula.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo succeed in this role, you cannot just be a casual fan. You need a deep, almost encyclopedic knowledge of the NBA, historical matchups, player stats, and the current debate culture to create content that genuinely hooks a hardcore basketball audience and drives massive comment velocity.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Software You Will Use:\n\r\n\n\r\nNano Banana Pro: You will be provided access to generate images via our centralized Higgsfield Team Account so there is no cost to you. All text generation happens natively inside the prompt—no Photoshop or Canva required.\n\r\n\n\r\nSeedance 2.0 & Topaz: You will generate high-fidelity video motion using Seedance 2.0, and then use Topaz to upscale all final video assets to crisp 4K at 60fps. (Note: Access to these external tools will be provided. Once Seedance 2.0 is available on Higgsfield, we will transition that step into our Team plan).\n\r\n\n\r\nGoogle Drive & \n: \n is our HQ for all communication, concept pitches, and draft reviews (using a simple emoji approval system). Final high-resolution assets are strictly uploaded to our shared Google Drive.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Daily Responsibilities:\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Generation: Generate 5 AI images (Nano Banana Pro) and 6 short-form videos (Seedance 2.0 + Topaz upscaling) daily, strictly following our established text/image debate formulas and visual hooks.\n\r\n\n\r\nCopywriting: Write highly engaging captions, relevant hashtags, and debate-sparking questions for each post to drive community interaction.\n\r\n\n\r\nAsset Management: Upload all drafts to designated \n channels for quick review, then push final approved assets to Google Drive.\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunity Management: Act as a moderator for our page via Meta Business Suite. Reply to comments to boost algorithmic engagement, manage our official\n Group, and ensure our lead magnet links (wallpaper packs) are pinned in the comments as soon as posts go live.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Are Looking For:\n\r\n\n\r\nDeep, obsessive knowledge of the NBA, basketball history, and debate topics (e.g., MJ vs. LeBron, peak performances, rings vs. stats). You should be able to spot a flawed basketball argument from a mile away.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with AI image generation, video creation tools, and video upscaling software.\n\r\n\n\r\nReliability to hit the 11-post daily quota consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nExcellent written English for copywriting and community replies.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Perks:\n\r\n\n\r\nBase Pay: $400 - $500 USD per month ($100 - $125/week), paid weekly via Wise.\n\r\n\n\r\nPerformance Bonus: An end-of-month cash bonus if the page's overall Average View Duration hits our target metrics.\n\r\n\n\r\nBuffer Time: This is a full-time, 40-hour/week role. The content generation will leave you with healthy buffer time each day to handle moderation, research, and ideation without burning out.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\nPlease reply with the phrase \"Nothing but net\" at the top of your application so we know you read the entire post. Include a brief summary of why your favorite NBA team will (or won't) win the championship this year, and link to any previous AI, video editing, or community management work you have done.

I spent 20 years at Procter & Gamble and left recently to build my own businesses. I’m now growing a personal brand on LinkedIn, running consulting projects, building a coaching practice, and organizing a TEDx event.\n\r\n\n\r\nThings are moving fast. But I’m doing too much myself, and the things I’m doing manually are things that someone with real experience could do faster and better.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can learn more about me here: \n/in/priscila-pree-silva\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nThe work has three elements to it:\n\r\n• Content and design — creating LinkedIn carousels, infographics, lead magnets, and other visual content in Canva or Figma. Scheduling, repurposing, and helping grow my presence on LinkedIn.\n\r\n• Operations and project management —\n marketing, SOPs, project tracking, keeping tools and systems organized. You keep things from falling apart so I can focus on clients and content.\n\r\n• Personal support — calendar, travel, family coordination, reminders.\n\r\nAs the business grows, the role will evolve. I need someone who’s excited by that, not threatened by it.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI PROFICIENCY IS ESSENTIAL\n\r\nI use AI daily. I expect you to use AI tools as a multiplier in everything you do.\n\r\n• When I ask you to research 20 podcast hosts, you don’t spend 8 hours Googling. You use AI to build an initial list in 30 minutes, then spend your time verifying it.\n\r\n• When you draft a message, you use AI to generate options, then apply your judgment to pick and refine the best one.\n\r\n• When we need a new SOP, you use AI to draft the framework, then refine it based on reality.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI handles the 60% that’s mechanical. You handle the 40% that requires judgment, creativity, taste, and human connection. Together we operate like a team of 5.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Makes This Role Different\n\r\nI’m not looking for someone who waits for instructions. I’m looking for someone who:\n\r\n• Brings expertise I don’t have. You’ve supported creators or entrepreneurs before. You see me about to make a mistake you’ve seen before and you say something.\n\r\n• Gets things in order. I’m a builder who understands the value of structure. I am trying to grow my ventures right and need someone that ensures there is structure with the \nntum.\n\r\n• Gives honest feedback. If you have a better idea, tell me.\n\r\n• Thinks like a partner. I want someone who grows with the business, takes on more responsibility over time, and has real input into how we work.\n\r\n• Helps build the team. As the business continues to grow, I’ll look to you to help identify and bring on additional support. If you know great people, even better.\n\r\n\n\r\nKEY AND ESSENTIAL SKILLS\n\r\n• Excellent written English communication skills\n\r\n• Very strong attention to detail\n\r\n• Positive 'can do' attitude and willingness to take on tasks and learn new things\n\r\n• Willing to work hard and want to grow professionally\n\r\n• Proficiency with AI tools\n\r\n• LinkedIn knowledge, you understand the platform and the culture\n\r\n• Proactive communication, you flag problems early and push back respectfully\n\r\n\n\r\nPAY \n\r\n• $\n/month full-time (40 hrs/week) depending on experience and skills\n\r\n• Open to taking on 2 part-time tea\nmbers instead if your skills are excellent in a specific area\n\r\n\n\r\nPERKS\n\r\n• You control your own time as long as you have a few hours around 7:30AM EST-9:00AM EST. \n\r\n• Flexible time off. If you need time off just let me know 2 weeks in advance.\n\r\n\n\r\nAPPLYING FOR THE JOB\n\r\nSend me an\n to \n\r\nSubject: Virtual Assistant - [Your Name]\n\r\nInclude:\n\r\n1. Short intro (3-5 sentences): Why would you like this position and why are you a good fit for it. \n\r\n2. AI tool experience: Which tools, how often, one concrete example of how AI made your work better.\n\r\n3. Design samples: Portfolio link or 2–3 examples of social media content you’ve created.\n\r\n4. Availability and expected monthly rate.\n\r\n5. What software and tools do you use (for\n, creative work, research and AI)\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include your CV and creative portfolio. \n\r\n\n\r\nI am looking for a tea\nmber for the long term and will offer raises and bonus’ based on performance as we grow the company and you progress. Therefore I will only look at applicants that really want the role.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are invited to the interview stage, there will be a written and creative task that will be paid.

You're the engine that keeps the machine running while I focus on creating.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you'll do:\n\r\nPost content daily across Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and YouTube on a consistent schedule\n\r\nRepurpose short-form video scripts into Instagram carousels, LinkedIn posts, and Substack/newsletter articles\n\r\nDesign clean, scroll-stopping carousels in Canva that match my brand aesthetic\n\r\nAdapt content for each platform — write tailored captions, adjust hooks for TikTok vs IG vs LinkedIn (not just cross-posting the same thing everywhere)\n\r\nRespond to comments and DMs across all platforms in my voice — build real relationships, not generic replies\n\r\nFlag brand deal inquiries and collaboration requests that come through DMs\n\r\nManage and maintain the content calendar so nothing gets missed\n\r\nTrack performance metrics weekly — what's working, what's not, what to double down on\n\r\nStay current on platform algorithm changes, trending formats, and new features\n\r\nHelp grow a loyal, engaged community — not just followers, but people who actually care\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be:\n\r\nExperienced managing social media for a creator, brand, or business (show me the accounts)\n\r\nSkilled in Canva — you can take a script or concept and turn it into a beautiful carousel without much direction\n\r\nA strong writer who can adapt tone across platforms — casual and punchy for TikTok, professional but human for LinkedIn, engaging for Instagram\n\r\nSomeone who understands community building, not just posting — you know the difference between growing followers and growing fans\n\r\nFamiliar with scheduling tools (Later, Buffer, or similar)\n\r\nOrganized and consistent — if a post is supposed to go out Tuesday at 9am, it goes out Tuesday at 9am\n\r\nProactive — you spot opportunities and flag them, you don't wait to be told\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to have:\n\r\nExperience in the tech/AI space or interest in learning it\n\r\nExperience writing newsletters or Substack articles\n\r\nUnderstanding of LinkedIn content strategy specifically\n\r\nYou've grown a social media account before (yours or someone else's)\n\r\n\n\r\nStart: Immediate with 1-week paid trial\n\r\nGrowth potential: This role grows as the brand grows. We're scaling from 2-3 posts per week to daily content across 4+ platforms. More brand deals, more content, more platforms = more hours and higher pay for you. I want someone who's in this for the long run.\n\r\n\n\r\nTO APPLY — You MUST complete all 3 steps. Applications that skip any step will not be considered.\n\r\n1. Show me your work. Share social media accounts you've managed, carousels you've designed, or content you've repurposed across platforms. If you've grown an account, tell me where it started and where it is now.\n\r\n2. The Repurpose Test. Here's a concept: \"Most people think AI uses more energy than it actually does — one ChatGPT prompt uses less energy than boiling a kettle.\" Show me how you'd turn this into (a) an Instagram caption, (b) a LinkedIn post, and (c) describe what a 5-slide carousel would look like for this topic.\n\r\n3. The Community Question. You're managing an account with 142K followers but engagement has been inconsistent. What are 3 specific things you'd do in your first two weeks to start building a more engaged, loyal community? Don't give me generic advice — be specific.                ",

    "description": "\n                    JOB TITLE: Short-Form Video Editor (After Effects) — AI, Instagram/TikTok\n\r\nSALARY: $1,100 USD/month\n\r\nTYPE: Full-time (40 hours/week)\n\r\nLOCATION: Remote (Philippines)\n\r\nSCHEDULE: Async, with Vancouver overlap (PST) for feedback\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE MISSION\n\r\n\n\r\nPrismiera is a luxury jewelry brand with a short-form video series already producing cinematic content on YouTube — mythology, history, goddess archetypes, and Dark Academia aesthetics.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone to own the Instagram and TikTok side.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT repurposing YouTube content into different aspect ratios. This is building platform-native content that makes a woman feel powerful in under 20 seconds. You'll create original short-form edits and cinematic skits using AI-generated footage, voiceovers, and atmospheric visuals — designed from the ground up for how Instagram and TikTok audiences actually consume.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe other half of this role: you'll be working with our AI-generated personas who serve as the visual anchor across our short-form content. You'll generate, composite, integrate, and stylize AI character visuals into edits that feel striking and intentional, not gimmicky. If the idea of building a visual identity around an AI persona excites you, keep reading!\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE STYLE\n\r\n\n\r\nThe content mix you'll produce:\n\r\n\n\r\n65% VIBE & SCENARIO — The kind of reel a woman sends to her group chat with no caption because the vibe speaks for itself.\n\r\n\n\r\n25% CINEMATIC SKITS — High-end, visually stunning executions of viral formats and dark humor. The premise can be slightly unhinged or ironic, but the visuals never break luxury. Think high-end perfume commercial meets TikTok audio trend. The Goddess is never the butt of the joke — she's the punchline, and she always wins.\n\r\n\n\r\n10% SENSORY / EXPERIMENTAL — Layered, fast, loop-optimized. Visual overload with mythological texture. The algorithmic wildcard.\n\r\n\n\r\nYES: Aspirational. Lethal elegance. Fashion-edit energy. Dark femininity. Music-driven impact. Content that feels like a luxury car reel meets ancient mythology. Cinematic skits using our AI personas — high-production value, deadpan, surreal, or darkly ironic.\n\r\n\n\r\nNO: CapCut presets. Generic motivational quote reels. Low-effort vlog-style acting. Slapstick comedy. Anything that looks like it was made in Canva. Anything that cheapens a demi-luxury product.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\n\n\r\nCreate & Adapt: Produce original Instagram/TikTok-native content using AI-generated visuals, trending audio, and our brand's mythology. Some pieces you'll build from scratch. Others you'll adapt from assets in our YouTube production pipeline. Either way, you're not resizing — you're crafting content shaped for how each platform rewards engagement.\n\r\n\n\r\nCinematic Skits: Build short-form skits around our AI personas that use trending formats, dark humor, or deadpan irony — executed at a visual level that never drops below luxury. People share it for the joke, follow the page for the aesthetic.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Persona Integration: Composite and stylize our AI-generated characters into edits as a visual anchor. She's not a narrator in your content — she's the presence. The face the eye locks onto while mythology and music layers move around her.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Content Generation: You won't just receive AI assets — you'll create them. Using tools like Seedance 2.0 and Seedream, you'll generate goddess visuals, atmospheric environments, and character footage that feed directly into your edits. You're both the director and the editor.\n\r\n\n\r\nMusic-Sync Editing: Your cuts, transitions, and visual reveals are married to the beat. You understand rhythm as a storytelling tool. Swells, drops, silence, impact — all intentional.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlatform Instinct: You understand what Instagram rewards vs. what TikTok rewards. You know what gets saved on IG. You know what gets looped on TikTok. You design for those behaviors, not just for visual quality.\n\r\n\n\r\nInstagram Packaging: Beyond the Reel itself — you contribute to grid cohesion, caption strategy, and Story sequencing. The profile should make someone think \"I want to be part of this\" within 2 seconds of landing.\n\r\n\n\r\nVolume at Speed: Once your templates and aesthetic are locked, your turnaround per piece should be significantly faster than building from zero. We expect high output.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nCORE REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter Effects (Mandatory). Compositing, layering, motion graphics, light/shadow matching. This is your primary tool. You build visual experiences, not just cuts.\n\r\n\n\r\nPremiere Pro. For project handoffs and consistency with the rest of the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Generation Fluency. This is not optional. You'll be using frontier AI tools daily — not just editing AI output, but generating it. You'll learn to prompt, iterate, select, and refine AI-generated visuals as a core part of your production workflow. We provide paid accounts for all tools (Seedance 2.0, Seedream, and whatever launches next). What we need is someone who treats these tools as creative instruments, not novelties.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Aesthetic Eye. You instinctively know the difference between aspirational and try-hard. Between elegant and overproduced. Between powerful and loud. Your edits make people feel something before they consciously understand what they're looking at.\n\r\n\n\r\nMusic & Rhythm. You've made edits where the music drives the visuals — AMVs, fashion reels, phonk edits, fan edits, whatever. You understand pacing as a weapon. You know what \"the drop\" means and you know when NOT to use it.\n\r\n\n\r\nLoop Thinking. You design edits that reward rewatching. The cut that lands on beat, the detail you only catch the second time, the seamless loop point. You think in circles, not lines.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong English. Daily async communication — clear, direct, professional.\n\r\n\n\r\nReliable & Coachable. You hit deadlines or warn early. You take direct feedback and iterate fast. You flag problems with options, not excuses.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nBONUS SKILLS (Not Required, But We'll Notice)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Color grading — pushing AI output and mixed footage into a consistent luxury palette\n\r\n- Typography sense — text overlays that feel intentional and premium\n\r\n- Sound design — SFX layering beyond just music (risers, hits, atmospheric texture)\n\r\n- Carousel / static design for Instagram companion posts\n\r\n- Understanding of Instagram analytics — saves, shares, completion rates, and what drives them\n\r\n- Experience building visual identities for brands or personas on social media\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWEEKLY OUTPUT\n\r\n\n\r\nRamp-up (first 2–3 weeks): 3–5 pieces as you learn the brand aesthetic, lock your AE templates, learn the AI generation tools, and calibrate with the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nSteady state: 10–15 pieces per week across Instagram and TikTok — a mix of original productions and asset-based adaptations depending on the content calendar.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW THIS ROLE FITS\n\r\n\n\r\nOther editors handle cinematic YouTube production and visual effects — you own social media. Same mythology, same brand, different platform behavior. Each editor has a distinct lane, and yours is how Prismiera looks and feels on Instagram and TikTok.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nRAM: 16GB minimum (32GB preferred) + SSD\n\r\nReliable high-speed internet (upload speed matters)\n\r\nMust run After Effects, Premiere Pro, and browser-based AI tools simultaneously\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nPAID TRIAL (Shortlisted Candidates)\n\r\n\n\r\nBefore any full-time commitment, we run a weekly paid trial. We provide real assets from our production pipeline, style references, and the AI persona visuals. You deliver content. Trial is compensated at $250 USD at the end of each week. If it's a mutual fit after 30 days, we transition to regular bi-weekly payments (before work).\n\r\n\n\r\nThis protects both sides — you see whether the work fits your strengths, we see whether the output fits our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\r\n\n\r\n- Paid accounts for all frontier AI tools — Seedance 2.0, Seedream, and whatever launches next\n\r\n- Creative ownership — you're defining how a luxury brand looks and feels on Instagram and TikTok from day one\n\r\n- An AI persona to build around — not a hypothetical, an active visual identity you'll shape and evolve\n\r\n- A role that evolves as the tools evolve — this job will look different in six months, and that's the point\n\r\n- Clear briefs — asset libraries, mood references, and specific direction for every batch\n\r\n- Direct feedback — specific, constructive notes on every edit\n\r\n- A brand worth building — Prismiera launches soon. A second AI-native brand is incubating behind it. You're not joining a finished machine. You're helping build one.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION\n\r\n\n\r\n$1,100 USD/month. Paid trial at $250 USD/week, transitioning to bi-weekly payments of $550 (before work) after 30 days.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nOWNERSHIP & CONFIDENTIALITY\n\r\n\n\r\nAll outputs (edits, project files, prompts, generated assets, persona visuals) are Prismiera property and must remain confidential.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a generic cover letter.\n\r\nUse 7 apply points or more when applying.\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: PRISMIERA SOCIAL — [Your Name]\n\r\n\n\r\nSend the following (in this order):\n\r\n\n\r\n1. The Vibe Test. Link to ONE edit you've made that is aspirational, aesthetic, or fashion-adjacent — or a skit that demonstrates platform-native virality instinct. Format doesn't matter. The feeling does.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. The Rhythm Test. Link to ONE edit where the music drives the visuals. Show us your beat-sync instinct. (Can overlap with #1 if one video demonstrates both.)\n\r\n\n\r\n3. The Creative Instinct Test (3–5 sentences total). You're given a 45-second cinematic video about a queen who poisoned her entire court, a folder of our AI Goddess visuals, and a dark atmospheric beat. Pitch two reworks: (A) a 15-second Instagram Reel designed to get saved — tell us your audio choice, pacing, and what the first 2 seconds look like; and (B) a 15-second cinematic skit that uses dark or deadpan humor without losing the luxury feel.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. AI Experience (1–2 sentences). What is your experience level with generative AI tools? If none, say so — we'll evaluate the rest on its own merits.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Hardware. Your PC specs: CPU / GPU / RAM. Plus your internet upload speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Turnaround Estimate. Given existing footage, a music track, and an established AE template — how long would a 15–20 second piece take you?\n\r\n\n\r\n7. The Rewrite. Rewrite this sentence to sound dark, powerful, and aspirational: \"She is really cool and strong and she wins.\"                ",

No cap. As the brand scales, bonus milestones increase — your winning ads become worth more over time. Full-time position available as we scale.**\n\r\n\n\r\nHey, I'm Asad. I'm building e-commerce brands in the health and wellness space. I'm looking for an AI ad creator who's already proven — someone who's made winning ecom ads, knows their way around AI tools, and is ready to collect bonuses by creating ads that actually convert.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't a traditional video editing role. You're not cutting YouTube videos or making corporate content. You're creating AI-powered direct-response ads that sell. I hand you a script and an inspo video. You build the entire ad. Your ads hit, you get bonuses. You stay consistent, your rates go up. You keep delivering, you move to full-time.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## How This Works\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll start with 5 videos/week.\n\r\n\n\r\n**What I give you:**\n\r\n- A finished script\n\r\n- An inspo video — a winning ad to reference for style, format, and pacing\n\r\n- Occasional notes if I want a specific editing style or approach\n\r\n\n\r\n**What you handle — everything else:**\n\r\n- Study the inspo video and reverse-engineer the format\n\r\n- Generate all AI content — avatars, b-roll, voiceover, visual assets\n\r\n- Source b-roll footage as needed\n\r\n- Full assembly — pacing, cutaways, text overlays, transitions\n\r\n- Final polish and delivery\n\r\n\n\r\nI write the strategy and the scripts. You bring them to life.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## What You'll Be Creating\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll start with 5 videos/week. Every ad is different. Some concepts will be a HeyGen talking head with b-roll sprinkled throughout. Some will be a Sora-generated hook for the first 15 seconds with Kling 2.6 b-roll for the rest. Some will use sourced social media footage with AI voiceover. The concept changes — your job is to execute whatever the brief calls for.\n\r\n\n\r\n**AI tools you'll be using:** HeyGen, Gemini, Enhancor, Sora, Kling 2.6, ElevenLabs. You should already be familiar with these or similar tools.\n\r\n\n\r\n** Sourcing B-roll** TikTok, Instagram, Kalodata, Youtube\n\r\n\n\r\n**Content lengths range from 30 seconds to 4 minutes**, depending on the concept — short-form ads, mid-length authority ads, and longer VSLs.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## What I Expect From the Ads You Create\n\r\n\n\r\nOur ads don't do surface-level agitation. We don't mention a pain point once and move on to the product. We go deep. The tension in the ad should build as the video progresses — second 40 should feel heavier than second 10. Every round deeper into the ad should raise the emotional stakes.\n\r\n\n\r\nThen — and only then — there should be a feeling of relief as the solution is introduced. The viewer should feel the weight lift. That contrast between deep tension and genuine relief is what makes our ads convert.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe visuals you source and generate need to match this emotional arc. Not random footage — visuals that amplify the tension during agitation and feel like a release during the solution.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Who I'm Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n### Requirements (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Proven experience creating winning ecommerce ads — show me your results, not just a portfolio. Ad spend, ROAS, revenue you've helped drive.\n\r\n- Strong experience with AI ad creation tools — you should already be using HeyGen, Sora, Kling, Gemini, ElevenLabs, or similar tools regularly. Not \"willing to learn.\" Already using them.\n\r\n- Understanding of direct-response ad structure: hook ? problem ? deep agitation ? solution ? CTA\n\r\n- Ability to source and generate all visual assets independently — I give you the script and inspo. You create everything else.\n\r\n- Portfolio showing ecommerce ad work — not general editing, not music videos, not vlogs\n\r\n- Strong English comprehension — you'll be reading scripts and briefs daily\n\r\n- Reliable internet connection and your own editing setup\n\r\n\n\r\n### Mindset & Character\n\r\n\n\r\n- **You think like a marketer, not just an editor.** You understand hooks, pattern interrupts, desire, objections, and CTAs. You watch ads and think about why they work or why they don't.\n\r\n- **Results over aesthetics.** You care about whether the ad converted, not whether it just looks pretty. When something doesn't work, you're curious about why.\n\r\n- **Hungry.** You're not here to coast. You want to create winners, stack bonuses, and grow into a full-time role.\n\r\n- **Coachable.** You take feedback as fuel, not criticism. When something's not working, you figure out what to do differently.\n\r\n- **Self-directed.** I give you a script and an inspo video. You take it from there without needing your hand held through every decision.\n\r\n- **Fast without cutting corners.** Good quality always. But you don't take three days on a one-day task either.\n\r\n\n\r\n### Nice to Have (Not Required)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Health and wellness niche ad experience\n\r\n- Static ad design skills\n\r\n- Understanding of direct-response copywriting principles\n\r\n- Experience with market sophistication and awareness level targeting\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Who Should NOT Apply\n\r\n\n\r\n**Do not apply if:**\n\r\n\n\r\n- You have no experience creating ecommerce or direct-response ads — this is not a training role\n\r\n- You've never worked with AI tools like HeyGen, Sora, or Kling\n\r\n- You don't understand ad structure — if \"hook ? problem ? agitation ? solution ? CTA\" doesn't mean anything to you, this isn't the right fit\n\r\n- You want gentle feedback — I give direct, honest feedback because that's how we get better ads\n\r\n- You work slowly and can't deliver consistently\n\r\n- You want an easy, low-pressure gig\n\r\n- You just follow instructions and never think for yourself\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you've read all of this and you're more excited, not less — keep reading. You're the person I'm looking for.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Compensation\n\r\n\n\r\n**Pay per concept based on video length:**\n\r\n\n\r\n30-60 seconds: $7 per concept\n\r\n1-2 minutes: $14 per concept\n\r\n2-3 minutes: $20 per concept\n\r\n3-4 minutes: $25 per concept\n\r\n\n\r\nVariations of winning ads are priced at half rate.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Performance bonus:** $25 for every winning ad — any ad that hits $1,000 in spend at our target ROAS. No cap. Create 5 winners in a month, that's $125 in bonuses on top of your concept pay. Create 10, that's $250.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Rate increases:** Deliver consistently and your per-concept rates go up. Simple — better work, better pay.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Path to full-time:** This starts as per-concept work. As the brand scales and ad volume increases, this becomes a full-time salaried position for the right person.\n\r\n\n\r\n--\n\r\n\n\r\n## Team & How We Work\n\r\n\n\r\nSmall team — me, you, and our creative strategist. We move fast, take big swings, and do everything with high intent. I'm here to support you every day with scripts, inspo videos, feedback, and creative direction.\n\r\n\n\r\nDaily communication via WhatsApp. You submit work, I give feedback, you iterate, we test. Fast loops — you'll always know how your ads performed.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## How to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\n**Submit the following:**\n\r\n\n\r\n1. **Portfolio link** — Ecommerce and direct-response ad work only. Show me AI-generated ads, Meta ads, any ads you've created that actually performed. Include performance data if you have it — spend, ROAS, revenue. Do not send general editing reels.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. **Completed trial task** — Attached is a creative brief with a script and an inspo video. Build the ad. Your application will not be considered without a completed trial task.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. **Short introduction video (1-2 minutes)** — Optional but powerful. Introduce yourself, show me your best work, and tell me why you're the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. **Answer these questions in your application:**\n\r\n- How many ecommerce ads have you created in the last 6 months?\n\r\n- What AI tools do you use regularly for ad creation?\n\r\n- Show me your best-performing ad — what was the spend and ROAS?\n\r\n- Describe the structure of a high-converting direct-response video ad.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm looking for someone who's already proven, already using AI tools, and ready to create winning ads. You get paid per concept, you earn bonuses when your ads win, your rates increase as you prove yourself, and this grows into a full-time role as we scale.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNo cap on bonuses. No ceiling on growth. You create winners, everybody wins.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf that's you — apply.\n\r\n\n\r\n— Asad                ",

No cap. As the brand scales, bonus milestones increase — your winning ads become worth more over time. Full-time position available as we scale.**\n\r\n\n\r\nHey, I'm Asad. I'm building e-commerce brands in the health and wellness space. I'm looking for an AI ad creator who's already proven — someone who's made winning ecom ads, knows their way around AI tools, and is ready to collect bonuses by creating ads that actually convert.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't a traditional video editing role. You're not cutting YouTube videos or making corporate content. You're creating AI-powered direct-response ads that sell. I hand you a script and an inspo video. You build the entire ad. Your ads hit, you get bonuses. You stay consistent, your rates go up.

You bring them to life.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## What You'll Be Creating\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll start with 5 videos/week. Every ad is different. Some concepts will be a HeyGen talking head with b-roll sprinkled throughout. Some will be a Sora-generated hook for the first 15 seconds with Kling 2.6 b-roll for the rest. Some will use sourced social media footage with AI voiceover. The concept changes — your job is to execute whatever the brief calls for.\n\r\n\n\r\n**AI tools you'll be using:** HeyGen, Gemini, Enhancor, Sora, Kling 2.6, ElevenLabs. You should already be familiar with these or similar tools.\n\r\n\n\r\n** Sourcing B-roll** TikTok, Instagram, Kalodata, Youtube\n\r\n\n\r\n**Content lengths range from 30 seconds to 4 minutes**, depending on the concept — short-form ads, mid-length authority ads, and longer VSLs.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## What I Expect From the Ads You Create\n\r\n\n\r\nOur ads don't do surface-level agitation. We don't mention a pain point once and move on to the product. We go deep. The tension in the ad should build as the video progresses — second 40 should feel heavier than second 10. Every round deeper into the ad should raise the emotional stakes.\n\r\n\n\r\nThen — and only then — there should be a feeling of relief as the solution is introduced. The viewer should feel the weight lift. That contrast between deep tension and genuine relief is what makes our ads convert.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe visuals you source and generate need to match this emotional arc. Not random footage — visuals that amplify the tension during agitation and feel like a release during the solution.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Who I'm Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n### Requirements (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Proven experience creating winning ecommerce ads — show me your results, not just a portfolio. Ad spend, ROAS, revenue you've helped drive.\n\r\n- Strong experience with AI ad creation tools — you should already be using HeyGen, Sora, Kling, Gemini, ElevenLabs, or similar tools regularly. Not \"willing to learn.\" Already using them.\n\r\n- Understanding of direct-response ad structure: hook ? problem ? deep agitation ? solution ? CTA\n\r\n- Ability to source and generate all visual assets independently — I give you the script and inspo. You create everything else.\n\r\n- Portfolio showing ecommerce ad work — not general editing, not music videos, not vlogs\n\r\n- Strong English comprehension — you'll be reading scripts and briefs daily\n\r\n- Reliable internet connection and your own editing setup\n\r\n\n\r\n### Mindset & Character\n\r\n\n\r\n- **You think like a marketer, not just an editor.** You understand hooks, pattern interrupts, desire, objections, and CTAs. You watch ads and think about why they work or why they don't.\n\r\n- **Results over aesthetics.** You care about whether the ad converted, not whether it just looks pretty. When something doesn't work, you're curious about why.\n\r\n- **Hungry.** You're not here to coast. You want to create winners, stack bonuses, and grow into a full-time role.\n\r\n- **Coachable.** You take feedback as fuel, not criticism. When something's not working, you figure out what to do differently.\n\r\n- **Self-directed.** I give you a script and an inspo video. You take it from there without needing your hand held through every decision.\n\r\n- **Fast without cutting corners.** Good quality always. But you don't take three days on a one-day task either.\n\r\n\n\r\n### Nice to Have (Not Required)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Health and wellness niche ad experience\n\r\n- Static ad design skills\n\r\n- Understanding of direct-response copywriting principles\n\r\n- Experience with market sophistication and awareness level targeting\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Who Should NOT Apply\n\r\n\n\r\n**Do not apply if:**\n\r\n\n\r\n- You have no experience creating ecommerce or direct-response ads — this is not a training role\n\r\n- You've never worked with AI tools like HeyGen, Sora, or Kling\n\r\n- You don't understand ad structure — if \"hook ? problem ? agitation ? solution ? CTA\" doesn't mean anything to you, this isn't the right fit\n\r\n- You want gentle feedback — I give direct, honest feedback because that's how we get better ads\n\r\n- You work slowly and can't deliver consistently\n\r\n- You want an easy, low-pressure gig\n\r\n- You just follow instructions and never think for yourself\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you've read all of this and you're more excited, not less — keep reading. You're the person I'm looking for.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Compensation\n\r\n\n\r\n**Pay per concept based on video length:**\n\r\n\n\r\n30-60 seconds: $7 per concept\n\r\n1-2 minutes: $14 per concept\n\r\n2-3 minutes: $20 per concept\n\r\n3-4 minutes: $25 per concept\n\r\n\n\r\nVariations of winning ads are priced at half rate.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Performance bonus:** $25 for every winning ad — any ad that hits $1,000 in spend at our target ROAS. No cap. Create 5 winners in a month, that's $125 in bonuses on top of your concept pay. Create 10, that's $250.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Rate increases:** Deliver consistently and your per-concept rates go up. Simple — better work, better pay.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Path to full-time:** This starts as per-concept work. As the brand scales and ad volume increases, this becomes a full-time salaried position for the right person.\n\r\n\n\r\n--\n\r\n\n\r\n## Team & How We Work\n\r\n\n\r\nSmall team — me, you, and our creative strategist. We move fast, take big swings, and do everything with high intent. I'm here to support you every day with scripts, inspo videos, feedback, and creative direction.\n\r\n\n\r\nDaily communication via WhatsApp. You submit work, I give feedback, you iterate, we test. Fast loops — you'll always know how your ads performed.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## How to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\n**Submit the following:**\n\r\n\n\r\n1. **Portfolio link** — Ecommerce and direct-response ad work only. Show me AI-generated ads, Meta ads, any ads you've created that actually performed. Include performance data if you have it — spend, ROAS, revenue. Do not send general editing reels.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. **Completed trial task** — Attached is a creative brief with a script and an inspo video. Build the ad. Your application will not be considered without a completed trial task.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. **Short introduction video (1-2 minutes)** — Optional but powerful. Introduce yourself, show me your best work, and tell me why you're the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. **Answer these questions in your application:**\n\r\n- How many ecommerce ads have you created in the last 6 months?\n\r\n- What AI tools do you use regularly for ad creation?\n\r\n- Show me your best-performing ad — what was the spend and ROAS?\n\r\n- Describe the structure of a high-converting direct-response video ad.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm looking for someone who's already proven, already using AI tools, and ready to create winning ads. You get paid per concept, you earn bonuses when your ads win, your rates increase as you prove yourself, and this grows into a full-time role as we scale.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNo cap on bonuses. No ceiling on growth. You create winners, everybody wins.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf that's you — apply.\n\r\n\n\r\n— Asad                ",
