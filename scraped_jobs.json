Your job is to think like a cheater - and then build systems that stop them. As our screening platform is used by many candidates, a growing number are leveraging AI tools to attempt to game the process. While we catch most already, you'll be on the front lines of detecting, analyzing, and countering this behavior.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a hybrid white hat / red hat role: you'll actively attempt to defeat your own screening form, then design defenses and detection mechanisms to prevent it.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Do\n\r\n\n\r\n- Attempt to bypass screening questions using the latest tools to identify vulnerabilities \n\r\n- Analyze submission patterns, response quality, and behavioral signals to build detection heuristics for AI-generated answers\n\r\n- Stay current on emerging AI capabilities and prompt engineering techniques to anticipate new attack vectors\n\r\n- Produce internal reports on AI evasion trends and recommended countermeasures\n\r\n- Admin and general assistant duties alongside, data entry may also be required, the role will evolve with your skills\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Bring\n\r\n\n\r\n- Hands-on experience with AI tools and an understanding of how they can be prompted to produce convincing, human-like answers\n\r\n- A methodical, adversarial mindset - you naturally look for holes in systems\n\r\n- Background in HR tech, trust & safety, content integrity, or cybersecurity is a strong plus\n\r\n- Ability to communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience with prompt injection, jailbreaking, or red teaming LLMs\n\r\n- Familiarity with NLP-based AI detection tools\n\r\n- Prior work in hiring, recruiting, or HR operations\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role Matters\n\r\n\n\r\nHiring decisions shape organizations.

You'll be protecting the integrity of the hiring process at scale.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur hiring process looks to connect with the real person and design roles with dignity for who they actually are, and the skills they genuinely possess - especially those skills that they may not even be aware of in themselves.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen candidates use AI, we don't get to create roles that fit them, and they are less likely to get jobs that they love.

We want someone who reads widely, thinks deeply, and has opinions. You'll research and write original pieces on topics like behavioral design, digital addiction, AI and the self, attention economics, neurotechnology, persuasion systems, and the ethics of mind-influencing tech. You'll also edit and sharpen the work of others, maintaining a consistent standard of intellectual rigor and readability across everything we publish.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Do\n\r\n\n\r\n- Research, pitch, and write long-form and short-form pieces on psychotech themes\n\r\n- Edit contributions from other writers, improving clarity, structure, and depth without losing their voice\n\r\n- Stay current on developments in psychology, neuroscience, tech ethics, and human-computer interaction\n\r\n- Help shape the editorial direction and tone of the publication\n\r\n- Engage with reader responses and contribute to building a genuine intellectual community around the work\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n- A strong, distinctive writing voice - someone with a clear perspective, not just a facility with words\n\r\n- Genuine curiosity about the psychological dimensions of technology, not just surface-level interest\n\r\n- The ability to write rigorously without writing drily - you can hold complexity and remain readable\n\r\n- Experience writing or editing in adjacent fields (tech, science, philosophy, culture) is valued\n\r\n- Comfort working independently and taking ownership of your ideas from pitch to publication\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nOn AI Use\n\r\n\n\r\nOnce you're part of the team, AI tools are fair game. Use them to research, brainstorm, draft, edit - whatever helps you do your best work. We're pragmatic about this.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe application is a different matter entirely.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe want to meet you - your actual voice, your real curiosity, your genuine perspective. And to be clear: that doesn't mean perfect English. Typos are fine. Imperfect grammar is fine. We're not screening for flawless prose - we're screening for a real person with real ideas. Some of the most interesting thinkers we've worked with write in their second or third language, or simply don't lose sleep over a missed comma. That's never been a problem.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we can't work with is a response that could have been written by anyone - or no one. AI-generated applications tell us little about who you are or whether you'd actually thrive in this role.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe do screen applications for AI-generated content. If we detect it, we won't reach out, we won't explain why, and you'll have simply spent time on something that went nowhere. Save yourself the effort and just write as yourself.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe best applications we receive are the ones where we can tell there's a real person on the other side who genuinely has something to say and shares their personal views.

This is great if you like working by yourself in the quiet, but it can be terribly painful if you need the energy of coworkers nearby.\n\r\nOur Cultural Values - We're an American company with an incredibly unusual culture. Even by American standards, our 7 cultural values are highly unusual. Our culture is challenging for people accustomed to corporate culture and especially difficult for people who grew up in Confucian cultures. It's a great culture for people who speak directly and have a great deal of self-confidence and ownership. If you identify as a misfit, you'll do well.\n\r\nMultiple Software Systems - You're going to need to learn how to use 12 different software systems. This is great if you want to get exposed to and experience lots of technology, but it can be tough if you have a hard time learning technology. Secret Message - When you apply, you'll see a box that asks if you want to add anything else. Type in PINK ELEPHANT in all capital letters exactly as we've shown it here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCheat Code for getting a job with us:\n\r\n1) Our application comprises the majority of our recruiting process. Because of that, we suggest that you give us thoughtful responses and rich stories. We typically only interview applicants who give rich and detailed answers to our questions. If you write short responses so that you can hurry up and finish the application, you will not get interviewed.\n\r\n2) Tell us stories about how your actions match your beliefs and values. For example, if I say I value health and fitness, you don't know if I'm telling you the truth or if I'm just telling you what sounds good. But, if I tell you things I've done, I can illustrate my values of health and fitness with proof. For example, I go to the gym 4 days per week, I've done 6 triathlons, including an Ironman, and I can swim 3000 meters in one hour. My examples of things I've done prove that my actions match my values system.\n\r\n3) Be vulnerable and honest. We take very detailed notes during the interview process, and we conduct extensive background checks. If the stories you tell about yourself don't match what your references say, we will not hire you. We'd rather hire a C student who is honest about being a C student than someone who is a C student but tries to pass themselves off as an A student. Remember, this is an entry-level job. We're not looking for perfect. We're looking for an excellent cultural fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply: Please click on the link: \n/work-opportunities/administration-agent                ",

You’ll also help track internal tasks across Ashlex’s divisions so leadership always knows what’s done, what’s next, and what’s blocked.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo do well here, you should be an actual Hubstaff Tasks power user who understands templates, projects, epics, sprints, automations, burndown, and how to keep a board from turning into spaghetti. You know the normal web dev flow—backlog to sprint to code to QA to staging to production—and you’re comfortable managing both WordPress builds (themes, plugins, page builders) and custom development (basic FE/BE concepts and APIs). You’ve worked with Agile and Kanban, and you know when to use which. \n\r\n\n\r\nStrong written English, steady organization, and calm under pressure are musts. It’s a plus if you can write simple test cases and UAT checklists, speak basic Git and environments, and handle release basics like hosting, DNS, and SSL.\n\r\n\n\r\nA quick but important note: no AI-generated applications. Write in your own words. If your application reads like a bot, we won’t review it. We may ask for a short Loom to confirm real Hubstaff Tasks usage.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your message, first describe your Hubstaff Tasks experience—how long you’ve used it, the features you rely on, and include a 1–3 minute Loom walking through a board you built (blur anything sensitive) if you can. Next, explain your approach to Agile vs. Kanban in 5–8 sentences and define, in your own words, what “sprint goal,” “WIP limit,” and “definition of done” mean to you. Then walk us through your development process: the differences between bugs, features, and technical debt, and your release checklist from staging to production. \n\r\n\n\r\nShare links to three to five projects you managed (include your role, team size, and timeline) and one custom dev project (stack if known, any API work, and how you handled QA and handoff) if you can.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you like clear plans, clean boards, and getting things shipped, you’ll fit right in. Apply now.                ",

    "description": "\n                    About Us\n\r\nWe operate 2 profitable e-commerce stores and are launching our 3rd in the high-end camping and overlanding niche. This is a high-margin category with strong demand from customers who value quality gear and expert service.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll work directly with the owner during launch phase, seeing how we source products, set pricing, build marketing campaigns, and scale stores from zero to profitable. Most VAs never get this level of exposure to 7-figure e-commerce operations.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Actually Is\n\r\nYou'll manage operations (not people) for a new store during its critical launch phase. This means owning three core areas: customer experience, order fulfillment accuracy, and operational reporting.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs we scale and hire support staff in 6-12 months, you'll transition into team leadership. The systems and SOPs you build now become the foundation you'll eventually delegate.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Core Responsibilities (80% of your time)\n\r\nCustomer Service Management\n\r\n• Handle all customer interactions via\n, chat, and phone\n\r\n• Process inquiries, returns, exchanges, and disputes professionally\n\r\n• Maintain inventory accuracy in Shopify\n\r\n• Flag stock issues before they become customer problems\n\r\nDaily Operations Reporting\n\r\n• Submit end-of-shift report covering: tasks completed, blockers encountered, support needed\n\r\n• Track key metrics: orders processed, support tickets closed, errors caught\n\r\n• Identify patterns that need owner attention\n\r\n\n\r\nSecondary Responsibilities (20% of your time)\n\r\n• Maintain accurate product listings (pricing, descriptions, inventory levels)\n\r\n• Coordinate with vendors and dealer partners on orders and promotions\n\r\n• Track sales performance and identify conversion opportunities\n\r\n• Document processes and update SOPs as workflows evolve\n\r\n• Flag customer feedback patterns that should inform product or marketing decisions\n\r\n• Support seasonal campaigns (BFCM, holiday promos)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Need to Succeed\n\r\nRequired Experience\n\r\n• 2+ years in e-commerce operations (customer service + order management + platform administration)\n\r\n• Proven Shopify experience: building listings, managing inventory, processing bulk updates\n\r\n• Experience managing multiple priorities in a fast-paced environment\n\r\nTechnical Requirements\n\r\n• Proficiency with Shopify, ClickUp, Airtable, and Google Workspace (or ability to learn quickly)\n\r\n• Reliable computer setup and 20+ Mbps internet connection\n\r\n• Backup solutions for both power and internet outages\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Style\n\r\n• Self-directed: you identify and solve problems without waiting for instructions\n\r\n• Detail-oriented: accuracy matters more than speed\n\r\n• Customer-focused: you view complaints as opportunities to improve systems\n\r\n• Process-minded: you naturally document and refine how things get done\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus\n\r\n• Knowledge of outdoor, camping, or overlanding gear\n\r\n• Previous experience in a store launch or fast-growth phase\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Schedule\n\r\n• Full-time: 40 hours per week\n\r\n• U.S. business hours: 9 PM–6 AM PHT or 10 PM–7 AM PHT (depending on Daylight Saving Time)\n\r\n• 1-hour daily break\n\r\n• Five days per week\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role Matters\n\r\n• You're not just processing orders. You're building the operational foundation for a store in a high-margin niche. During the trial period and first 6 months:\n\r\n• You'll learn how we source, price, and market products from experienced operators running multiple 7-figure stores\n\r\n• Your input shapes the SOPs and systems we'll use to scale\n\r\n• You get first consideration for team lead and category manager roles when we expand\n\r\n• You'll have direct access to the owner for mentorship on e-commerce strategy\n\r\n• This isn't a stepping-stone VA role. It's employee #1 for a store with serious growth potential.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're NOT a Fit If:\n\r\n• You need micromanagement or detailed daily task lists\n\r\n• You can't work 9 PM–7 AM PHT consistently\n\r\n• You experience frequent power/internet outages without backup solutions\n\r\n• You view this as temporary income between other opportunities\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication Instructions\n\r\nTo be considered, follow these instructions exactly:\n\r\nSubject Line:\n\r\n[Your First Name] – I Am Your New E-Commerce Operations Manager\n\r\n(Example: Kevin – I Am Your New E-commerce Assistant Store Manager)\n\r\nInclude:\n\r\nCover letter (focus on relevant e-commerce experience)\n\r\nResume\n\r\n\n\r\nAnswer These Questions (numbered format, complete sentences):\n\r\n• Describe your most relevant e-commerce operations experience: platform used, team size, daily order volume, and specific responsibilities you owned.\n\r\n• What specific Shopify tasks have you performed? (Be detailed: inventory management? Bulk uploads? App integrations? Product page optimization?)\n\r\n• Provide an example of a difficult customer service situation you handled: what was the issue, what did you do, and what was the outcome?\n\r\n• What are your current work commitments and availability?\n\r\n• Provide your internet speed (attach speed test screenshot), computer specifications, and describe your backup solutions for power and internet outages.\n\r\n• Why are you interested in this role specifically, rather than other VA positions?\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant: AI-generated or template responses will be immediately disqualified. We're looking for thoughtful, specific answers that demonstrate you read and understood this posting.                ",

This is not a \"behind-the-scenes\" data entry role. You will be responsible for converting rental leads into tenants and ensuring our revenue is protected through professional, yet aggressive, rent collections.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe ideal candidate is a self-starter who doesn't wait for instructions. You should enjoy talking to people, have a \"sales\" mindset, and be comfortable holding firm, professional boundaries when tenants are past due.\n\r\n\n\r\nTop Priority Responsibilities (The Core of Your Day)\n\r\n- Lead Conversion & Sales: Respond immediately to rental inquiries. Your goal is to qualify leads and move them toward a showing as fast as possible.\n\r\n- Virtual Showings: When a prospect arrives at a property, you will \"meet\" them via phone or video call to conduct the virtual showing, highlight property features, and answer questions in real-time.\n\r\n- Assertive Collections: Make daily outbound calls to tenants with past-due balances. You must be comfortable with \"firm\" conversations to ensure payments are made, while remaining professional and following company policy.\n\r\n- Reporting & Accountability: Lead the \"Daily Huddle\" by reporting your metrics (Leads in, Showings set, Collections status). You must be able to explain your results and your plan for the next 24 hours.\n\r\n- Applicant Screening: Conduct thorough rental verifications by calling previous landlords and employers.\n\r\n\n\r\nSecondary Responsibilities (Operational Support)\n\r\n- Manage and update property listings across various platforms.\n\r\n- Monitor \n boards to ensure maintenance and operations tasks are moving.\n\r\n- Run weekly/monthly reports on rent collected, late fees, and utilities.\n\r\n- Update our CRM (TurboTenant/Brivity) with detailed notes on every lead and tenant interaction.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’re Looking For\n\r\n- Fluent English (Verbal & Written): You must have near-native English fluency. You will be on the phone with American tenants and prospects all day; clarity and tone are essential.\n\r\n- High \"People Skills\": You should be naturally kind, sociable, and able to build rapport quickly over the phone.\n\r\n- The \"Self-Starter\" Trait: You don't need a manager to tell you to make your calls. You see a lead or a late payment and you take action immediately.\n\r\n- Grit for Collections: You can handle \"tough\" conversations without getting flustered. You are persistent and results-oriented.\n\r\n- Tech Savvy: Proficiency in Google Workspace, \n, and TurboTenant (or similar) is a major plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Schedule & Requirements\n\r\n- Shift: Must be available to work Monday-Friday 9am-6pm Eastern Standard Time business hours.\n\r\n- Environment: Must have a quiet home office, a noise-canceling headset, and a stable, high-speed internet connection (and a backup).\n\r\n- Commitment: This is a long-term role for someone looking to grow with a stable company.\n\r\n- Pay is every 2 weeks. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please start your message with the words 'I am a self-starter' and include a 60-second voice recording introducing yourself.

    "description": "\n                    About the Project\n\n\n\nWe’re building a community-first social media app (iOS/Android) for the LGBTQIA+ community. Focused on belonging, emotional safety, and meaningful connections, the app aims to connect those without access to queer community in their everyday lives and who feel left behind by mainstream social media platforms.\n\n\n\nThe app prioritises human connection over performance and community over dating- or appearance-first mechanics. It’s designed to be inclusive and promote emotional safety, allowing users to express themselves, their interests, and build community without pressure, harassment, or fear of judgement.\n\n\n\nWe currently have a v1 prototype in Figma that’s ready for early user testing. We’re now looking for a UI/UX designer who can help refine the app’s identity, UX clarity, and overall cohesion — particularly around sensitive and high-impact flows like onboarding, profile setup, and early engagement with community-driven features such as posts and feed.\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\n • Leverage a strong UX and product mindset to review and iterate on an existing Figma prototype\n\n • Improve user flows to ensure they feel respectful, inclusive, and genuinely solve identified user challenges\n\n • Help define and refine the app’s visual and experiential identity\n\n • Collaborate closely with the founder, Product Manager, and soon-to-be onboarded engineering team throughout the design process\n\n • Prepare production-ready designs and support handoff from design to code (design files, documentation, specifications, assets, iteration support)\n\n • Continuously incorporate feedback from internal stakeholders and user testing insights\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nRequired Experience & Skills\n\n • 4+ years of well-rounded UI/UX experience, including mobile iOS / Android applications\n\n • Prior work on consumer-facing products (social, community, content-driven platforms strongly preferred)\n\n • High proficiency in Figma (auto layout, components, design systems, collaboration workflows)\n\n • A product-oriented approach — you think about intention, impact, and user outcomes, not just visuals\n\n • Experience collaborating with engineers and supporting design implementation\n\n • Comfort working in an iterative, collaborative environment\n\n • Excellent written and verbal English communication\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nCommunity & Inclusion Context\n\n\n\nExperience designing for queer, LGBTQIA+, or other marginalised communities is highly valued. Everyone is welcome to apply, but you should demonstrate:\n\n • Thoughtfulness around inclusive design, language, and identity-sensitive UX\n\n • Awareness of how standard patterns (e.g., onboarding questions, profile fields, interaction mechanics) can unintentionally exclude or alienate users\n\n • A genuine interest in designing spaces that prioritise emotional safety and consent\n\n\n\nAllies and those who are part of the queer community are warmly encouraged to apply.\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nNice to Have\n\n • Experience conducting and incorporating user research or usability testing\n\n • Mobile development experience (Swift, Kotlin, and/or Flutter)\n\n • Experience creating supporting assets (app store visuals, marketing materials)\n\n • Timezone availability between Europe and Australia\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\n\n\nPlease apply via\n (do not apply via platform messaging).\n\n\n\nSend your application to:\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the subject line:\n\nUI/UX Designer – LGBTQIA+ App – [Your Name]\n\n\n\nIn your\n, please include:\n\n 1. A brief overview of your mobile UI/UX experience\n\n 2. Links to relevant portfolio work (especially social, community, or identity-sensitive projects)\n\n 3. A short note on how you approach inclusive or community-centered design\n\n 4. Your hourly rate or project rate expectations\n\n 5. Your current availability (hours per week + start date)\n\n 6. Your timezone\n\n\n\nTo help us understand your product thinking, please also answer this short question:\n\n\n\nWhat is one onboarding or profile design pattern you believe can unintentionally exclude users, and how would you redesign it?\n\n\n\nApplications will be reviewed by both the Founder and Product Manager. Shortlisted candidates will be contacted directly.\n\n\n\n?\n\n\n\nSelection Process\n\n • Initial application review\n\n • First discussion (20–30 minutes)\n\n • Portfolio & skills discussion (approx. 1 hour)\n\n • Decision\n\n • ? 1 month contract to start, renewable pending successful collaboration                ",

This is not frequent, but it does happen.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn those situations:\n\r\n\n\r\n- You are the default escalation owner  \n\r\n- You d\n whether something genuinely requires immediate action  \n\r\n- If it does, you take ownership of resolving or coordinating it  \n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not an on-call role, and you are not expected to monitor messages constantly.\n\r\n\n\r\nHowever, when true emergencies occur, ownership does not pause.\n\r\n\n\r\nClear boundaries exist to prevent abuse, and the expectation is judgement, not availability.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Who this role is for\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is for someone who:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Has already owned delivery in an agency or services business  \n\r\n- Is comfortable making decisions others may disagree with  \n\r\n- Enjoys fixing systems before scale  \n\r\n- Does not need constant validation or direction  \n\r\n- Is confident communicating with clients and teams  \n\r\n\n\r\nYou are expected to make judgement calls and challenge decisions when needed. This is a role with real responsibility, not a task-management position.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## What this role is not\n\r\n\n\r\n- Not a sales role  \n\r\n- Not a customer support role  \n\r\n- Not a junior or learning position  \n\r\n- Not a role where every decision is checked with the founder  \n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Fractional nature and growth\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role starts fractional because:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Support operations are already stable  \n\r\n- Initial focus is on ownership, visibility, and control rather than volume  \n\r\n- Web and development work will increase as lead generation ramps up  \n\r\n\n\r\nAs new work comes in, this role is expected to grow in both hours and responsibility. The intention is not to keep this small, but to build it properly.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are currently working elsewhere, we will want to understand:\n\r\n\n\r\n- What you are doing now  \n\r\n- How you would manage this role alongside it  \n\r\n- How you would handle this role growing over time  \n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## How we work\n\r\n\n\r\n- Remote, async-friendly team  \n\r\n- Clear expectations and direct communication  \n\r\n- Trust given upfront, backed by accountability  \n\r\n- Founder available for alignment and escalation, not day-to-day supervision  \n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## What we are looking for\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be a strong fit if you:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Have run delivery or operations in a services or agency-style business  \n\r\n- Are comfortable owning delivery and handling escalations  \n\r\n- Can protect scope and say no when needed  \n\r\n- Think in systems, not just tasks  \n\r\n- Are calm under pressure and decisive when required  \n\r\n- Have experience working with remote teams  \n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with WordPress or similar digital services is important.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## How to apply, use the link below:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n                ",

    "description": "\n                    WANTED! The World's Most Detail-Oriented Remote Bookkeeping VA\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen you apply, please make sure the subject line is: \"I actually read the instructions\"\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We Are\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're Real Cents Organized, a growing bookkeeping firm that specializes in helping real estate investors and landlords build wealth through accurate, timely financials. Our clients aren't just property owners—they're building generational wealth, and they depend on us to give them the clarity they need to make smart decisions.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're a small, tight-knit remote team (currently just two of us!) that values accuracy over speed, proactive communication, and continuous learning. We don't micromanage—we hire self-directed professionals who take ownership of their work and treat our clients' businesses like their own.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're at an exciting inflection point: we have more clients than we can handle (great problem!), and we need a second VA to help us scale without sacrificing the quality our clients love.\n\r\n\n\r\nQuick note: When you\n your application, please start your message with \"I'm excited to apply for the bookkeeping position at Real Cents Organized\" so we know your\n didn't get caught in our spam filter. We've had issues with legitimate applications landing in junk folders lately!\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need a detail-obsessed bookkeeping VA who lives and breathes QuickBooks Online, understands the unique challenges of real estate accounting, and can work independently to deliver accurate financials on tight deadlines.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't data entry—this is strategic bookkeeping. You'll be the person who catches the $5,000 repair that should have been capitalized before it costs our client their tax deduction. You'll be the one who spots a missing security deposit refund before the landlord gets a call from an angry tenant.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're the type of person who color-codes their personal budget, triple-checks your work, and feels genuine satisfaction when a reconciliation balances to the penny—keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nJob Description\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll be responsible for these specific deliverables each month:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Transaction Categorization: Accurately categorize monthly transactions across multiple rental properties in QuickBooks Online. You'll distinguish between repairs vs. capital improvements, allocate expenses to the correct properties, and ensure every transaction supports defensible tax positions.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Bank Reconciliations: Reconcile bank accounts monthly with 100?curacy. Find every discrepancy—even the $0.23 rounding errors—because precision matters.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Property-Level Financial Reporting: Generate clean, client-ready profit & loss statements for each rental property, plus consolidated owner statements, by the 5th of each month. No excuses, no delays—landlords make decisions based on these reports.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Compliance Tracking: Maintain meticulous records for security deposits, track vendor payments for 1099 preparation, and flag any transactions that could trigger IRS scrutiny.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Proactive Communication: Use ClickUp to update task status daily, flag discrepancies before they become problems, and ask clarifying questions when something doesn't add up. We'd rather you ask 10 \"unnecessary\" questions than make 1 incorrect assumption.\n\r\n\n\r\nQualifications\n\r\n\n\r\nWe care more about **how you think** than where you went to school. Here's what matters:\n\r\n\n\r\n- QuickBooks Online fluency - You don't just know where the buttons are; you understand chart of accounts structure, class/location tracking, and can troubleshoot when things break.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Real estate accounting experience - You've worked with rental properties before and understand the difference between a repair (expense immediately) and an improvement (capitalize and depreciate). Bonus if you've handled short-term rentals.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Obsessive attention to detail - You're the person who notices when a transaction is coded to \"Property A - Unit 1\" when it should be \"Property A - Unit 2.\" Small mistakes compound into big problems in this work.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong written English - You'll communicate directly with ClickUp comments and occasional\ns. We need clear, professional communication that builds trust.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Self-directed work style - We're async and remote. You won't have someone looking over your shoulder. You need to manage your own time, prioritize ruthlessly, and deliver on deadlines without hand-holding.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Technology comfort - Beyond QBO, you'll use ClickUp (project management and communication), Google Workspace, and ScreenshotMonitor (screen recordings).\n\r\n\n\r\nSalary & Growth\n\r\n\n\r\nStarting Compensation: $7/hour for 20-30 hours per week ($560-$840/month)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe know this is competitive for the Philippines market, and we're willing to pay for quality. After your 60-day trial period, here's the path forward:\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Month 6+:** Increase to $8/hour + potential for full-time hours (40/week = $1,280/month)\n\r\n- **Year 2:** Promotion to Senior Bookkeeper at $10/hour managing your own portfolio of clients\n\r\n- **Year 3+:** Potential equity stake or profit-sharing as we scale (we want to build this together)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe don't just hire people—we invest in them. Our current VA has been with us for 18 months.  \n\r\n\n\r\nPersonality Profile\n\r\n\n\r\n**You're probably a great fit if:**\n\r\n\n\r\n- You get genuine satisfaction from balancing to the penny (and mild anxiety when things are off by $0.01)\n\r\n- You're naturally skeptical—when something looks weird, you dig deeper instead of ignoring it\n\r\n- You prefer written communication over phone calls (but can handle a video call when needed)\n\r\n- You have a system for everything (folders, naming conventions, checklists—you're organized AF)\n\r\n- You'd describe yourself as reliable, methodical, and low-drama\n\r\n- You like working independently but aren't afraid to ask for help when you need it\n\r\n\n\r\n**You're probably NOT a great fit if:**\n\r\n\n\r\n- You're easily bored by repetitive tasks (bookkeeping has a rhythm—embrace it)\n\r\n- You're a \"big picture\" thinker who hates details (we need detail ninjas)\n\r\n- You need constant feedback and validation to stay motivated\n\r\n- You struggle with deadlines or tend to procrastinate\n\r\n- You're juggling 5 other clients and can only give us 5 hours/week of distracted attention\n\r\n\n\r\nSkunks (Deal-Breakers)\n\r\n\n\r\nLet's be honest about potential challenges upfront. These are non-negotiable, so please only apply if you're genuinely comfortable with:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Strict Deadlines: Month-end close is sacred. If reports are due by the 5th, \"the 6th\" isn't acceptable. Clients make financial decisions based on our timelines.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. High Accountability: Every error has real consequences. A misclassified transaction could cost a client thousands in unnecessary taxes or trigger an IRS audit. We need someone who takes this seriously.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Occasional US Business Hours: Most work is async, but you may need to join tea\netings during US Eastern Time business hours (which means early morning if you're in the Philippines). This won't be daily, but maybe 2-4 times per month.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. 60-Day Trial Period: We're investing heavily in finding the right person (hence this detailed job posting!). The first 60 days are a mutual evaluation. If it's not working for either of us, we'll part ways professionally—no hard feelings.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Real Estate Focus: If you're looking to do general bookkeeping across industries, this isn't the role. We specialize in rental properties, and you'll need to develop deep expertise in this niche.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Values\n\r\n\n\r\nThese aren't just words on a wall—we actually make decisions based on these:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Accuracy Over Speed\n\r\nWe'd rather you take an extra hour to get it right than rush and create cleanup work. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Proactive Communication\n\r\nDon't wait for us to ask. If you see a problem, flag it. If you're unsure, ask. If you'll miss a deadline, tell us ASAP so we can plan.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Continuous Learning\n\r\nTax laws change. QBO adds features. Real estate strategies evolve. We expect you to stay current through webinars, articles, and training (which we'll provide/fund).\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Client-First Mindset\n\r\nOur clients are building generational wealth for their families. Treat their money with the same respect you'd want someone to treat yours.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Trust & Ownership\n\r\nWe don't micromanage. We hire adults, give them the tools and context they need, and trust them to deliver. In exchange, you own your results—good and bad.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's what we need from you (this is a test—follow the instructions exactly):\n\r\n\n\r\n1.\n Subject Line\n\r\n\"I actually read the instructions\"\n\r\n\n\r\nIf your subject line is anything else (like \"Bookkeeping VA Application\"), we'll know you didn't read this carefully—and attention to detail is literally the job.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Resume\n\r\n- File name: `FirstName_LastName_BookkeepingVA.pdf`\n\r\n- Example: `Maria_Santos_BookkeepingVA.pdf`\n\r\n- Highlight your QuickBooks Online experience and any real estate/property management clients\n\r\n- Keep it to 1-2 pages max—we value clarity over length\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Personality Assessment\n\r\nTake the free 16Personalities test at \n and include your 4-letter result (e.g., ISTJ, ISFJ) in your\n. We use this to understand work style, not to exclude anyone—there's no \"right\" answer.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Creative Question\n\r\nAnswer this in 2-3 sentences within your\n:\n\r\n\n\r\n\"If you were a QuickBooks report, which one would you be and why?\"\n\r\n\n\r\n(Seriously. We want to see how you think about the work, not just your resume credentials.)\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Video Introduction\n\r\nRecord a 60-second Loom video (\n is free) covering:\n\r\n- Your name and where you're based\n\r\n- Your QuickBooks Online experience (how many years? what industries?)\n\r\n- One example of a costly error you caught before it became a problem\n\r\n- Why you're interested in specializing in real estate bookkeeping\n\r\n\n\r\nInclude the Loom link in your\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Sample Work (Optional, but Impressive)\n\r\nIf you have any property-level P&Ls, reconciliation screenshots, or examples of your QBO work (with client names redacted), include them. Show us what \"excellent\" looks like in your book.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Happens Next?\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's our hiring process (transparent, fast, and designed to avoid wasting your time):\n\r\n\n\r\nWeek 1: We'll review applications and respond within 3 business days. If your application follows instructions and looks strong, we'll invite you to a paid trial project.\n\r\n\n\r\nWeek 2: Trial project ($20 for ~2 hours of work). We'll give you access to a QuickBooks sandbox with realistic scenarios. This lets you see the actual work, and lets us evaluate your skills beyond a resume.\n\r\n\n\r\nWeek 3: Top 2-3 candidates from the trial project will have a 30-45 minute Zoom interview. We'll discuss the work, your trial project, and cultural fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nWeek 4: We'll make an offer, finalize the contractor agreement, and get you onboarded!\n\r\n\n\r\nTotal timeline from application to start date: 3-4 weeks max.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy You Should Apply (Even If You're Nervous)\n\r\n\n\r\nLook, we know imposter syndrome is real. You might be reading this thinking, \"I don't check every single box—should I even apply?\"\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's our take: If you're detail-oriented, have solid QBO skills, and are willing to learn real estate accounting specifics, we want to hear from you. We'd rather teach someone the technical stuff (we can train) than try to teach attention to detail or work ethic (you either have that or you don't).\n\r\n\n\r\nThe fact that you read this entire job posting (it's long—congrats if you made it here!) suggests you're thorough. That's exactly what we need.\n\r\n\n\r\nReady to Apply?\n\r\n\n\r\nSend your application to: \n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: \"I actually read the instructions\"\n\r\n\n\r\nInclude:\n\r\n1. Resume (FirstName_LastName_BookkeepingVA.pdf)\n\r\n2. Personality type (from \n)\n\r\n3. Answer to the QuickBooks report question\n\r\n4. Loom video link (60 seconds)\n\r\n5. Optional: Sample work\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication deadline: March 12, 2026 (applications reviewed on a rolling basis)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're excited to find someone who nerds out about clean books as much as we do. If that's you, hit send—let's build something great together.\n\r\n\n\r\nP.S. - If you're thinking \"This job posting is way too long\"... you're probably not detail-oriented enough for this role. If you're thinking \"I love how thorough this is—it shows they actually care about finding the right fit\"... we're going to get along great.????                ",

You will be working inside live production systems that affect lead flow, bookings, and revenue across a real franchise network.\n\r\n\n\r\nAt Transform Hub, we care about people, and that extends to the people who work for us.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a chance to work alongside the Head of Tech and the CEO of a booming fitness franchise. You will learn about and get a chance to use emerging technology and use GHL for far more than a standard business or marketing agency.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Outcome\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are responsible for keeping our GoHighLevel systems and Google Sheets reporting accurate, live, and trusted across the entire franchise network.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf a franchisee or leader asks, “What’s happening with my leads and sales this week?”, we should be able to answer using dashboards and reports that you maintain.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis Is Not a Junior Role\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not looking for someone who is still learning GoHighLevel.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must already have hands-on experience managing live GoHighLevel accounts, diagnosing problems independently, and working in systems where mistakes affect real businesses.\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not apply if:\n\r\n\n\r\n- You have not used GoHighLevel in a live production environment\n\r\n- You cannot work UK hours (9am–5pm GMT/BST), Monday to Friday\n\r\n- You rely on snapshot cloning without understanding how the systems actually work\n\r\n- You are uncomfortable troubleshooting problems you have not seen before\n\r\n\n\r\nHours & Setup\n\r\n\n\r\n- Full-time: 40 hours per week\n\r\n\n\r\n- UK hours: 9am–5pm GMT/BST, Monday to Friday\n\r\n\n\r\n- Not an async role - you’ll work live alongside the UK team\n\r\n\n\r\n- Daily 10-minute Zoom check-in\n\r\n\n\r\n- Ongoing communication via Slack\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\nPriority 0 – Reporting & Data Hygiene (Daily / Weekly)\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is the foundation of the role.

    "description": "\n                    We are hiring reliable CSRs to join the growing team of The Comfort Authority company!\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE COMPANY:\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Comfort Authority is a top-rated Heating, Ventilating & Air Conditioning Company in Tampa Bay in Florida, USA. You can learn more about them here: \n/\n\r\n\n\r\nROLE DESCRIPTION:\n\r\n\n\r\nA typical day for a Call Center Representative is primarily to perform the work to book appointments to fill the call board with the required number of appointments. This involves making a high volume of outbound calls to existing customers to book appointments as well as taking and booking inbound calls. Other lead sources such as Podium, Yelp, etc. are other places the CSR will look to for customer requests for service. \n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional tasks such as addressing customer questions and concerns, assisting upset customers and handling administrative tasks such as looking up warranty information and/or communicating with management to resolve issues will also be required. The CSR will track their time via a spreadsheet and time will be monitored by the Call Center Manager.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe First CSR to arrive will go through the after-hours calls from all lead sources. The CSRs will help the call center department meet its goals by handling daily inbound and outbound calls, managing leads and booking service appointments for our customers via phone, chat, or\n.\n\r\n\n\r\nThroughout the day, the main priority of the CSR is to fill the call board. This is done through both outbounding to our existing customer base and receiving inbound calls from both existing and new customers. There is no limit to how many appointments can be booked in a day and only the Call Center Manager will let you know what days we are booking appointments for. The only communication outside the Call Center should be to let Dispatch know a call has been booked. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis position is repetitive and can be challenging to continue to perform at a high level. Performing at a high level is critical as this is the most important position in the company to keeping the business running. \n\r\nA critical part of this job is dealing with customers that are upset. The customer’s anger level is likely to be elevated, and this is something the CSR will have to work with. Customers will even call in yelling at the CSR and the CSRs need to know that it is not personal, and the CSR will need to be able to handle this and continue to perform at a high level.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe CSR will track and enter information from customer into our software, ServiceTitan. They must become fluent using this program for looking up and entering customer information, as well as notes from field personnel the customer may be calling in for.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe position is competitive in nature. Compensation will be hourly with some performance-based compensation. They must achieve 20 outbound calls per hour. 5-10% of people we speak with that we outbound should be booked. If these numbers are not hit, the business will not have the calls they need to keep everyone working and feeding their families.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking to hire CSRs to start full-time immediately, working in the EST time zone.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED EXPERIENCE AND TRAITS:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Previous customer service, particularly call center based, preferred, but we will be happy to train the right candidate – we hire for personality over experience.\n\r\n• Great phone voice. Excellent English communication skills, both written and oral.\n\r\n• Proficient in computer applications; experience with ServiceTitan is a plus!\n\r\n• Dependable and self-driven, with a strong sense of initiative.\n\r\n• Superior attention to detail, organized, eager to work, coachable, and motivated.\n\r\n• Exceptional customer service skills, always aiming to deliver top-notch satisfaction and work well within a team.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE OFFER:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Salary $5/hr and overtime pay (paid via Wise)\n\r\n• Paid training\n\r\n• Vacation or sick leave entitlement\n\r\n• Paid Holidays\n\r\n• A family. This is last on the list because it’s most important. We care about our team and expect you to bring that same caring when you join. We do a lot more than just work together and you’ll build life-long friendships here.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you think you are the one we are looking for, please respond to this job post with your quick video introduction (no more than 2 minutes) and answer this survey: \n. This will take you about 5-10 minutes to complete, but take your time and be thorough. Please confirm in your response that you have successfully completed the survey.                ",
