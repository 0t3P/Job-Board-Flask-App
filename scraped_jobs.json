Even with high volume, the brand must look premium.\n\r\nCommunity Management: Briefly engage with comments on the posts you put up to boost algorithm favorability.\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nAI Native: You don't just \"know\" AI; you use it to clone yourself. You are proficient with Nano Banana Pro for images and tools like CapCut/Veo for video.\n\r\nHigh-Speed Editor: You can edit a Reel in minutes, not hours. You understand pacing, trending audio, and hooks.\n\r\nRevenue Focused: You understand that \"Likes\" are vanity and \"Sales\" are sanity. You know how to write captions that get people to click the link in bio.\n\r\nVisual Eye: You can spot a \"bad\" font or \"off\" color instantly. You know how to maintain a consistent brand vibe.\n\r\nOrganized: Managing 300+ posts a month requires extreme organization. You must be comfortable using scheduling tools (e.g., Later, Buffer, or similar).\n\r\nThe Offer\n\r\nConsistent Income: $1,500 AUD/month retainer.\n\r\nCreative Freedom: We give you the keys to the brand's voice; you experiment and find what goes viral.\n\r\nAccess to Tools: We will provide access to our enterprise AI tools.\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nSend us a link to a social media account you have managed.\n\r\nScreening Question: Please list the exact AI stack (tools) you would use to generate 10 posts in one day for a brand like ours.\n\r\n\n\r\nRecommendation for your interview process:\n\r\nSince 10 posts/day is a lot, ask applicants to do a paid test task: \"Here is one product image. Use AI to create 3 distinct pieces of content (1 Story, 1 Post, 1 Reel concept) in under 30 minutes.\" This will immediately show you if they are actually fast enough to handle your volume.

    "description": "\n                    About STRbkeep\n\r\nSTRbkeep is a bookkeeping practice built specifically for short-term rental (STR) property owners and small hospitality businesses. We currently manage the books for 45+ clients — from individual property owners to multi-property LLCs — and we’re growing.\n\r\nWe’re not just maintaining books. We’re actively building the systems, workflows, and standards that will define how this practice operates as it scales. That means our processes are evolving, we’re testing new technology, and we’re looking for someone who’s excited by that — not intimidated by it.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nThis is not a heads-down, task-list-only position. Yes, there is real bookkeeping to do — reconciliations, categorizing transactions, recording platform fees. But we are looking for someone who goes beyond executing tasks and actually thinks about the work.\n\r\nHere is what that looks like in practice: You open a client’s QBO file for the first time. You look through the chart of accounts, the bank connections, how transactions have been categorized. You form an understanding of how things are set up — and then you come to me with questions. Not just “What do I do?” but “I see it’s set up this way — is that intentional? Here’s what I’d suggest.”\n\r\nIf you notice three clients have slightly different names for the same account, or that a bank rule could save 20 minutes a month, or that our work-tracking template is missing a column — we want to hear it. You will have a direct line to the owner, and your input will shape how we build this practice.\n\r\n\n\r\nBookkeeping\n\r\n• Record bank and credit card activity in QuickBooks Online\n\r\n• Reconcile bank accounts and credit cards on a monthly basis\n\r\n• Categorize and reclassify transactions; review P&L reports for misclassified expenses\n\r\n• Split mortgage payments, Stripe payouts, and platform fees across appropriate accounts\n\r\n• Record STR platform fees (Airbnb, VRBO, etc.) in QBO\n\r\n• Assist with catch-up bookkeeping for clients who are behind on multiple months\n\r\n• Support year-end work including 1099 review and preparation\n\r\n• Reverse or correct entries left by prior bookkeepers\n\r\n\n\r\nAdministrative & Client Support\n\r\n• Follow up with clients to collect statements, documents, and access credentials\n\r\n• Help onboard new clients — QBO setup, connecting bank feeds, initial data entry\n\r\n• Track task completion and flag items that need the owner’s review\n\r\n• Communicate with clients via\n (after introductions, using provided templates as a starting point)\n\r\n\n\r\nSystems & Process Improvement\n\r\n• Review how each client’s QBO file is set up and ask questions to understand the reasoning\n\r\n• Identify inconsistencies across client files (chart of accounts naming, categorization patterns, bank rules) and suggest standardization\n\r\n• Recommend improvements to workflows, templates, and tracking tools based on what you see in the day-to-day work\n\r\n• Be open to testing new tools and technology as we evaluate what works best for STR bookkeeping\n\r\n• Help document processes and preferences so the practice can scale beyond one person’s memory\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\nCurious and observant. You don’t just do what’s in front of you — you notice patterns, ask why things are the way they are, and think about how they could be better. When you open a client’s file, you’re reading the setup, not just the task list.\n\r\nSelf-motivated. You can take a general direction and run with it. You don’t need to be checked on constantly, and you’re comfortable figuring things out before asking for help — but you also know when to ask.\n\r\nA clear communicator. You can articulate what you’re seeing in a client’s books, explain your reasoning, and frame suggestions in a way that’s easy to act on. You’re not afraid to say “This doesn’t make sense to me” or “Here’s what I’d change.”\n\r\nComfortable with “in progress.” Our systems are being built right now. If you need a perfectly documented SOP before you can start, this isn’t the right fit. If you’re energized by helping create those SOPs, it is.\n\r\nDetail-oriented but practical. Accuracy matters. But so does knowing when something is good enough to move forward and when it needs to be perfect.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n• QuickBooks Online proficiency — you should be able to navigate QBO confidently, not just follow step-by-step instructions. You understand how the chart of accounts, bank feeds, reconciliations, and reports work together.\n\r\n• Bank reconciliation experience — this is a core part of the role across dozens of client accounts each month.\n\r\n• Excel proficiency — comfortable with sorting, filtering, basic formulas, and working with exported data.\n\r\n• Familiarity with Relay or similar banking platforms — experience connecting and managing bank feeds.\n\r\n• Reliable and responsive communication — you respond promptly, flag issues early, and keep the owner informed without being asked.\n\r\n• Willingness to work US business hours (CST) — or have significant overlap with US daytime hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have\n\r\n• Experience with short-term rental or hospitality bookkeeping\n\r\n• Familiarity with STR platforms (Airbnb, VRBO, Hospitable) and how their payouts and fees flow into accounting\n\r\n• Experience with 1099 preparation and year-end accounting\n\r\n• Interest in or experience with workflow tools, automation, or process documentation\n\r\n• Prior experience in a small or growing bookkeeping practice where you wore multiple hats\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat to Expect\n\r\nThis is a full-time engagement (approximately 40 hours/week), with workload varying based on client needs — month-end and year-end are busier. You will work directly with the owner, Cheyenne. Early on, expect a collaborative onboarding period where you will walk through client files together, discuss how things are set up and why, and establish shared expectations. Over time, the goal is for you to work more independently while continuing to surface questions and ideas.\n\r\nClient communication will be guided at first. Cheyenne will introduce you and provide templates. But we are looking for someone who can eventually own those conversations professionally and confidently.\n\r\nWe are also actively evaluating new tools and technology. If you are someone who likes trying new things and has opinions about what works, you will have a voice in those decisions.\n\r\n\n\r\nAPPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS (REQUIRED)\n\r\nTo be considered for this role, you must submit both of the following:\n\r\n1. Your resume\n\r\n2. A 2–3 minute video introduction explaining:\n\r\n– Your bookkeeping and QuickBooks Online experience\n\r\n– Why you believe you are a strong fit for this role\n\r\n– How you approach organization, communication, and process improvement\n\r\nPlease begin your video by addressing Cheyenne by name, as attention to detail is an important part of our hiring process.\n\r\nApplications without a video will not be reviewed.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not looking for a polished production — a simple recording from your phone or laptop is perfectly fine. What we care about is how you communicate, how you think, and whether you took the time to read this posting carefully.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Story Hunter - Blackfiles (3D Documentary Channel) | Remote, Flexible, Performance-Based\n\n\n\nABOUT US\n\nBlackfiles is a 300K+ subscriber YouTube channel that produces cinematic 3D animated stories about remarkable individuals who took on powerful systems, hackers who outsmarted the FBI, con artists who robbed banks with genius schemes, ordinary people who brought down cartels. We publish 3 videos per week and are growing fast.\n\nWe're looking for Story Hunters, obsessive researchers who can find the stories nobody else has covered and pitch them in a way that makes us say \"we NEED to make this video\".\n\n\n\nWHAT IS A BLACKFILES STORY?\n\nBefore you apply, you need to understand what we do. Watch at least 3 of these videos:\n\n - The Man Who Outsmarted EVERY Agency (John McAfee) — 1.9M views\n\n - The Most Genius Bank Heist EVER (Banco Río) — 1.75M views\n\n - The Prodigy Who Escaped North Korea — 1.17M views\n\n - The Man Who Outsmarted EVERY Government (Pavel Durov) — 1.21M views\n\n - The Man Who Found the Infinite Cash Hack — 1.28M views\n\n\n\nWhat do these stories have in common?\n\n 1. One named protagonist, not a group, not \"hackers,\" one specific person whose story we follow from beginning to end\n\n 2. A powerful antagonist, the FBI, CIA, NSA, a cartel, a government, a financial system. Something the audience instantly recognizes as powerful\n\n 3. An \"impossible\" feat, the protagonist did something that sounds too crazy to be real\n\n 4. A complete narrative arc, setup, escalation, crisis, resolution. These are documentaries, not news reports\n\n 5. Cross-market appeal, you don't need to be a hacker to find these stories fascinating. Anyone can connect to them\n\n\n\nWhat does NOT work on Blackfiles:\n\n - Stories about groups or unnamed collectives (\"The Hackers Who...\")\n\n - Generic cybersecurity explainers without a human drama at the center\n\n - Stories without an ending (still ongoing, unresolved)\n\n - Stories already covered by 10+ YouTube channels\n\n - Cryptocurrency hacks (our audience doesn't connect to digital currency theft)\n\n - Stories framed from law enforcement's perspective (\"How the FBI Caught...\")\n\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\nFind real stories that fit the Blackfiles formula, research them thoroughly, and submit structured story briefs. You are NOT writing scripts, you're finding the raw material and making the case for why each story will captivate our audience.\n\nYour deliverable is a story brief, a structured pitch that includes the proposed title, a summary, protagonist details, the hook, sources, and your reasoning for why it works. We provide a detailed template.\n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR\n\n - Someone who naturally falls down Wikipedia rabbit holes and reads longform journalism for fun\n\n - Broad knowledge of cybercrime, heists, espionage, con artists, whistleblowers, or similar \"dark\" true stories\n\n - The ability to evaluate WHY a story would work as a YouTube video, not just that it's interesting\n\n - Strong written communication — your pitch needs to sell the story in under 200 words\n\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n 1. We'll share our Story Selection Guide so you understand exactly what works on our channel and what doesn't\n\n 2. You submit story briefs using our structured template (title, summary, protagonist, hook, sources)\n\n 3. We review and respond to every submission within 12 hours\n\n 4. Approved stories enter our production pipeline\n\n\n\nCOMPENSATION\n\nThis is performance-based. The better your stories, the more you earn:\n\n ? Story approved for production = $60\n\n ???? Your proposed title is used = +$10 bonus\n\n ???? Video hits 300K views in 15 days = +$50 bonus\n\n ???? Video hits 500K views in 15 days = +$100 bonus\n\n ???? Video hits 1M views in 15 days = +$200 bonus\n\n\n\nWhat does this look like in practice? A researcher consistently delivering 8-10 approved stories per month earns $480-600+ base, plus view bonuses. Our average Blackfiles video gets 300K+ views, so bonuses are realistic, not theoretical.\n\nTop performers who prove themselves over 2-3 months will be offered a monthly retainer with guaranteed base pay + bonuses on top. We don't pay for stories that don't fit our channel, but we ALWAYS give feedback on why a pitch was rejected so you improve over time.\n\n\n\nTO APPLY\n\nComplete our application form: \n\nYou'll need to submit 3 story pitches using our format. This is your audition, show us you understand what Blackfiles needs. Budget 1-2 hours for a quality application.\n\nPayment: PayPal, crypto, bank transfer, Wise, or similar.\n\nLocation: Fully remote, any timezone.\n\nQuestions?\n us at \n                ",

Salary based on experience, grows with performance + bonus structures.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout TopFoxx\n\r\n\n\r\nTopFoxx is a women owned ecommerce eyewear brand creating fashion forward designs with real functionality. Our slogan is “sunglasses with a solution.” From floating sunglasses to tangle free aviators and foldable pocket sized designs, we build innovative products for modern women who want style with purpose. We are a lean, fast moving startup with strong revenue, bold branding, and a culture built on ownership, accountability, and performance. We do not hire often for roles like this. This is a rare opportunity to step into a high impact growth position inside a scaling brand, fully remote.\n\r\nWe value initiative, personal responsibility, and people who genuinely care about the quality of their work. Our team is supportive, direct, and collaborative. We communicate openly, help each other solve problems, and move quickly. At the same time, we hold a high standard. Mistakes can happen, but careless errors and repeated oversight are not acceptable. We expect people to double check their work, think critically, and take pride in execution. If you thrive in an environment where performance matters and growth is constant, you will do well here.\n\r\n\n\r\nRole Overview\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for a Full Stack Growth Marketing Manager who is entrepreneurial and can strategize and execute like a growth hacker, lead and operate like a director, analyze performance like a scientist, and move with the urgency and ownership of a founder.

You will identify funnel weaknesses, UX and UI improvements, conversion issues, and growth opportunities across the business, including landing pages, product pages, upsells, offers, and drop off points. If something affects revenue, you investigate it. If something breaks, you fix it. If there is a gap, you close it.\n\r\nThis is a lean startup environment. Growth challenges do not stay inside strict job descriptions. As needed, you are expected to step in, solve problems independently, and take full ownership of outcomes. We will lean into your strongest channel where you can drive the most impact, but you must be comfortable operating across the full ecommerce growth ecosystem and contributing ideas that improve performance across departments.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\n1.

Skills can be developed. Mindset cannot.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation and Growth\n\r\nThis is a remote international role. Compensation is based on level of experience and past proven performance.\n\r\nThere is clear upside for strong performers. As you drive more revenue and impact, your compensation will grow. This is a long term opportunity for someone who wants to become a key growth driver inside a scaling ecommerce brand.\n\r\nTopFoxx is for high performer A players only.

We run everything through one master pipeline in RESimpli.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for a detailed Lead Manager to keep this pipeline moving. Your job is to ensure that no lead gets stuck. You will categorize incoming leads (House vs. Land), ensure they are in the correct stage, and set tasks for our Acquisitions Manager (AM) and Dispositions Manager (DM) so they can focus on buying/selling. You must know RESimpli inside and out to manage multiple pipelines for different asset types (minimum one year experience with RESimpli required).\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Pipeline Movement (The \"Flow\" Manager):\n\r\n\n\r\n• Prevent Stagnation: You must monitor our \"New Leads\" and \"Follow Up\" stages daily. If a lead has been sitting in a stage for too long without a note or a next task, you must flag it or move it.\n\r\n\n\r\n• Stage Management: Ensure leads are physically moved in RESimpli from \"New Lead\" ? \"No Contact Made\" ? \"Due Diligence\" ? \"Offer Made\" etc etc. A lead should never sit in the wrong stage.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Asset Categorization (Tagging):\n\r\n\n\r\n• Identification: Since we use one pipeline for everything, you must identify the asset type immediately.\n\r\n    ? Land: Tag as LAND. Check for wetlands/access.\n\r\n    ? House: Tag as HOUSE. Check condition/year built.\n\r\n    ? Commercial/Park: Tag as PARK.\n\r\n\n\r\n• Note Taking: You must clearly note the asset details at the top of the file so the Acquisitions Manager knows exactly what they are looking at before they call.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Basic CRM Admin:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Data Entry: Update seller information and property details in RESimpli.\n\r\n• Builder Updates: Enter new builder buying criteria into BuyerBridge.ai when our team secures a new buyer relationship.\n\r\n• Contract Drafting: Generate standard contracts in RESimpli/DocuSign for the team to review (basic fill-in-the-blank).\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\n• RESimpli Familiarity: You do not need to be a tech wizard, but you must know how to navigate the dashboard, move leads, add tags, and set tasks, and use other tech tools.\n\r\n• High Attention to Detail: You are the person who ensures the data is accurate.\n\r\n• Asset Knowledge: Basic understanding of the difference between a vacant lot (wetlands/access) and a single-family home. Experience with mobile homes or RV's a plus.\n\r\n• English Proficiency: Fluent written English for notes and basic communications.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply: Simply reply to this job post with the answers to these 3 questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. If you see a lead sitting in the \"New Leads\" stage for 5 days with no notes, what would you do?\n\r\n2. How would you note a \"Mobile Home Park\" differently than a \"Vacant Lot\" in the CRM so our Acquisition Manager notices it immediately?\n\r\n3. On a scale of 1-10, how comfortable are you navigating RESimpli?\n\r\n4. Do you have experience with both homes and vacant land?\n\r\n5. Do you have experience doing due diligence on properties? If so, please explain?\n\r\n6. Do you have experience with setting up and managing Slack for a team?                ",

They come to us for solutions to complex challenges in their environments, and we work with them to create healthier, safer, and smarter spaces.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’re looking to join a purpose-driven organization making a tangible impact on the human experience, Kaiterra could be the perfect fit for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT THE ROLE:\n\r\nWe are seeking a business-savvy and hyper-organized Strategic Sales Partner to act as the \"right hand\" to our Senior Account Executive. This is not a standard \"Virtual Assistant\" role; it requires a commercial mindset, sharp judgment, and the ability to navigate complex deal cycles.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn this role, you will be responsible for strategic alignment: you will \"brain sync\" with the AE, anticipating needs before they are spoken. You will have the autonomy to manage the operational engine of the sales process - from researching key stakeholders to chasing internal legal teams - ensuring the AE can focus 100% on closing revenue. Crucially, you will act as a strategic gatekeeper. You will ensure that no deal stalls because of paperwork, and no meeting happens without a clear objective and research dossier.\n\r\n\n\r\nLocation: Remote (Philippines / Vietnam / Thailand preferred) \n\r\nJob Type: Full-Time (Must overlap with North American Business Hours) \n\r\nReporting to: Senior Account Executive\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Strategic Deal Orchestration\n\r\n- Shadow Management: Attend client meetings and forecast calls to capture nuances, action items, and \"read the room.\" You don't just take notes; you identify the \"unspoken\" risks and next steps.\n\r\n- Stakeholder Mapping: Conduct efficient research to build \"dossiers\" on key decision-makers. You will maintain a live \"Power Map\" in the CRM, identifying who the Champions and Detractors are for every major deal.\n\r\n- Pre-Meeting Intelligence: Before the AE talks to a CIO, you provide the briefing: recent news, financial reports, and strategic priorities. You ensure the AE never walks into a meeting unprepared.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Operational Execution & Internal Navigation\n\r\n- Pipeline Hygiene: Own the CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce) accuracy. You ensure every opportunity is updated, stages are correct, and close dates are realistic. The AE should never have to manually enter data.\n\r\n- Internal \"Paperwork\" Walking: Drive the deal process internally. You are the one chasing Legal, Finance, and Security teams to get contracts approved. You unblock the internal bottlenecks so the deal doesn't stall.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Administrative Leverage (\"The Time Defender\")\n\r\n- Inbox Triage: Manage the AE’s inbox to prioritize high-value client\ns versus internal noise. You draft replies for approval to speed up response times and ensure no VIP client is left waiting.\n\r\n- Calendar Strategy: Aggressively guard the AE’s time. If a client meeting moves, you immediately reshuffle internal commitments to ensure the AE preserves \"deep work\" blocks for prospecting.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Continuous Improvement\n\r\n- Process Optimization: Actively identify bottlenecks in the sales admin process. If you see a repetitive task, you build a template or a workflow to fix it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL BRING:\n\r\nEducation:\n\r\n- A Bachelor's degree is required to demonstrate foundational academic qualifications for this strategic role.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience:\n\r\n- Proven Business Experience: Minimum 2+ years in a high-performance professional environment. We highly value backgrounds in Management Consulting or Sales Operations.\n\r\n- Experience with CRM platforms, HubSpot preferred, is required for managing pipeline accuracy and data integrity.\n\r\n- Experience supporting senior executives or working in a fast-paced tech startup is a strong plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nSkills & Core Competencies:\n\r\n- \"Brain Sync\" Ability: High Emotional Intelligence (EQ). You can read between the lines of a meeting and understand the strategic context of a deal without needing everything explained.\n\r\n- Strategic AI Usage: You use Gemini as a force multiplier, not a crutch. You know how to prompt for research and drafting to work 10x faster, but you never blindly copy-paste. You fact-check every output to ensure accuracy and ensure the final tone is human and strategic.\n\r\n- Technical Precision: Mastery of Google Sheets/Excel, document sand presentation software. You are the person who catches the typo in the contract that everyone else missed.\n\r\n- Operational Rigor: You are hyper-organized. You don't wait for instructions; you see a problem (e.g., \"This contract is stuck in Legal\") and you fix it.\n\r\n- High-Velocity Communication: You are an exceptional writer. You can draft professional, \"executive-ready\"\ns that sound exactly like the AE.\n\r\n\n\r\n* ** Please apply for this position using the following URL: \n ***                ",

    "description": "\n                    Job Description:\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\nWe're a blockchain/DeFi company running production infrastructure that's bleeding money unnecessarily. Our AWS bill is sitting at $4,500/month – and we know it shouldn't be anywhere near that. We need someone who can come in, audit the whole setup, and actually fix it. Not just give us a report that sits in a folder.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe've already been through a few candidates who talked a big game but couldn't execute. We're done with that. If you're the type who needs handholding or can't work independently, this isn't for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Actually Do\n\r\n- Audit our entire AWS infrastructure and identify exactly where we're wasting money (we expect significant savings)\n\r\n- Optimize our Kubernetes clusters – right-size nodes, fix resource requests/limits, implement autoscaling that actually works\n\r\n- Implement cost controls: Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, spot instances where appropriate, and cleanup of orphaned resources\n\r\n- Set up monitoring and alerts so costs don't creep back up without us knowing\n\r\n- Document everything you do so the team can maintain it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHard Requirements (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n- 3+ years hands-on Kubernetes experience in production environments – EKS specifically preferred\n\r\n- Deep AWS knowledge: EC2, EKS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor\n\r\n- Proven track record of actually reducing AWS costs (be ready to share numbers/percentages)\n\r\n- Strong scripting skills (Python, Bash) for automation\n\r\n- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform or CloudFormation (Terraform preferred)\n\r\n- Self-starter who can take ownership and execute without constant oversight\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n!!!!CRITICAL: This Role Requires Surgical Precision\n\r\nThis is production infrastructure running live systems. Think of this like surgery – one wrong move can take everything down.\n\r\n- NO cowboy moves. You don't delete, modify, or remove anything without a clear plan first.\n\r\n- Every change must be planned out, documented, and confirmed with the CEO before execution.\n\r\n- Extreme attention to detail. You double-check and triple-check before touching anything.\n\r\n- If you're not 100% sure what something does, you ask first. You don't assume.\n\r\n- Methodical execution only. We value careful and correct over fast and reckless.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong Plus\n\r\n- Experience with blockchain/Web3 infrastructure\n\r\n- Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, or KEDA experience\n\r\n-  AWS certifications (Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer)\n\r\n- Experience with FinOps tools (Kubecost, CloudHealth, \n)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Need In Your Application\n\r\nDon't send a generic application. We will ignore it. Include:\n\r\n- Specific examples of AWS cost optimization you've done – what was the setup, what did you change, what % did you save?\n\r\n- Your Kubernetes experience – cluster sizes you've managed, scaling strategies you've implemented\n\r\n- Your availability and timezone (we need someone who can overlap with US business hours for some calls)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Structure\n\r\n- $20-25/hour based on experience and proven results\n\r\n- 20 hours/week to start – potential for more hours for the right person\n\r\n- Fully remote\n\r\n- Initial project: Comprehensive audit + implementation plan with clear cost reduction targets\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're someone who can actually deliver results and not just talk about them – we want to hear from you.
