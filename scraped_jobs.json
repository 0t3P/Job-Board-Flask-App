    "description": "\n                    Mission For TikTok Shop Executive Assistant\n\n\n\nTo track tangible results and identify revenue generating creators for TikTok Shop brands by:\n\nFinding creators’ TikTok usernames from their Discord handles\n\nCreating creator campaigns on Growi and inputting creators’ Tiktok handles\n\nSorting through Discord server members to identify top-performing TikTok Shop creators\n\nReaching out to creators to be a part of 7-day posting cohorts\n\nHandling additional weekly tasks that are assigned\n\nOutputs // KPIs:\n\nTrack results and identify revenue generating creators\n\nYou’ll achieve this through these primary methods:\n\nFinding creators’ TikTok usernames from their Discord handles\n\nWe host weekly coaching calls on Discord for each of our brands. We will give you a list of creators who attended each and you will find their TikTok handles.\n\nCreating creator campaigns on Growi and inputting creators’ Tiktok handles\n\nUsing a creator tracking software called Growi, you will create a separate campaign for each coaching Call. Then, you’ll add each creator who joined the respective call to the campaign using their handle you found earlier.\n\nSorting through Discord server members to identify top-performing TikTok Shop creators\n\nIn all of our brand’s Discord servers, we implement a ticket system that allows us to maintain 1 on 1 communication with all the top creators. \n\nYou will sort through all the members who join the Discord, find out their TikTok handle, and check their L30 day gmv on the TikTok Affiliate Center.\n\nThis is vital because it allows us to communicate with as many high potential creators as possible and maximize the number of videos they post.\n\nReaching out to creators to be a part of 7-day posting cohorts\n\nWe host 7 day posting cohorts where we take a group of 5 creators with potential to generate sales, put them in a group chat, and provide one video every day for them to replicate.\n\nYou will be in charge of identifying creators to be a part of these posting cohorts. Once you identify top performing TT Shop creators, you’re going to message them privately, asking if they want to be a part of the cohort.\n\nHandling additional weekly tasks that are assigned\n\nTurn new priorities from meetings, Slack, and ad?hoc requests into completed tasks with clear owners, deadlines, and visible progress. Ensure nothing falls through the cracks. \n\nDaily execution of team & administrative tasks\n\nIn addition to coaching the creators and maintaining these relationships, you will have a minimal amount of administrative tasks.\n\nDaily Check-Ins:\n\nProvide updates on what tasks you’ve been working on that day.\n\nReport findings of what’s working and what isn’t.\n\nShare ideas for improving client success.\n\nEnd of Day Report\n\nAt the end of each work day, you will be expected to complete a form outlining everything you completed for that day.\n\nWeekly Team Meeting\n\nAttend team check-in meeting via Google Meet every week.\n\n\n\nCompetencies:\n\nProficient in English \n\nPart of your job will require you to outreach hundreds of creators. You must be able to write clear, friendly DMs and hold a proper conversation with creators as needed. \n\nCommunication and responsiveness\n\nYou are active on Slack and respond to messages timely.\n\nHigh ownership and bias to action\n\nYou don’t wait for instructions on what to complete each day. You take action relentlessly and own the operations you’re in charge of.\n\nWhenever there’s a new batch of creators that join a brand’s Discord, you immediately begin looking them up on TikTok without me reminding you to.\n\nEvery week, there will be new tasks to handle. Upon hearing them, you will immediately spring to action and complete them as soon as possible.\n\nDisciplined\n\nA majority of your job will be manual work, but you’ll manage it at the highest quality. \n\nYou follow instructions exactly, document what you’ve completed every day, and don’t skip steps.\n\nOrganized\n\nYou will be in charge of tracking hundreds or even thousands of creators. You’re on top of all the work you’re completing, ensuring that you have the proper systems in place to deliver the highest quality possible. \n\nTikTok Shop Experience\n\nYou have experience operating within TikTok Shop Seller Center, Tiktok Shop Affiliate Center, and using tools like Growi. \n\nYou have a deep understanding of how to navigate through these platforms and look up creators usernames to find their L30 Day GMV.\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Assistant Position Description:\n\nTime\n\nYou will have the freedom to make your own schedule. That said, it is crucial that you have access to the necessary tools (Slack) to handle replies during work hours\n\nYou will be expected to complete your end of day tasks every day Monday-Friday.\n\nYou will also be expected to be online M-F from 8am - 5pm EST: replying to creator messages and communicating through slack.\n\nThis position is remote, so you will have the freedom to work from anywhere. Please ensure that you have a strong connection and there are minimal distractions when on calls with clients.\n\nCompensation\n\n$1000/mo full time\n\nPotential for added bonuses depending on performance\n\n\n\nPlease film a 5 minute max loom explaining:\n\n1. Previous experience you've had with TikTok Shop - brands you've worked with, results you've driven, etc. Only people with TikTok Shop experience will be considered.\n\n2. Why you are a good fit for the position.\n\n3. How to find a creators' last 30 day gmv generated. Share your screen and show yourself walking through this.                ",

    "description": "\n                    The Mission\n\r\nWe are looking for a Historical Story Hunter. This is not a typical virtual assistant role; it is a mission to dig through the \"vaults\" of time and unearth the strange, the tragic, and the unexplained. We are building a massive digital library of forgotten history, and we need a hunter who can track down original newspaper clippings from the 1800s and 1900s.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be responsible for stocking our \"Content Bucket\" months in advance. Your work will provide the raw, authentic evidence that makes history come alive for our global audience.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Daily Hunt\n\r\nYour focus is volume, discovery, and organization.

You’ll turn our real estate footage into scroll?stopping content for agents and builders, from the story idea and opening hook all the way through to final export.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is open to both gig?based and full?time, and it’s a strong way to stand out if you want to specialize in real estate and brand?driven storytelling.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. About SH Films\n\r\nSH Films is a real estate media company that helps agents and builders market properties and projects with high?impact video. We focus on listing walk?throughs, agent branding pieces, and builder process videos that show a home’s journey from dirt to finished product.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe work with professionals who care about their brand, speed, and quality. That means we value editors who can hit deadlines, communicate clearly, and still protect the quality of the final image.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. What You’ll Own\n\r\nYou are responsible for turning raw real estate footage into short?form videos that agents and builders can’t wait to post.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will:\n\r\n\n\r\nEdit short?form videos (15–90 seconds) for Reels, TikTok, and Shorts from property tours, branding shoots, and builder content.\n\r\n\n\r\nDevelop or refine pre?production concepts: simple story arcs, shot lists, and edit structures that make each property or brand feel intentional.\n\r\n\n\r\nWrite or improve hooks and on?screen text that grab attention in the first few seconds and keep viewers engaged.\n\r\n\n\r\nCreate multiple cuts from a single shoot (hero edit plus several supporting clips).\n\r\n\n\r\nAdd captioning, callouts, and simple motion graphics that highlight features, benefits, and brand messages.\n\r\n\n\r\nEnsure consistent color, sound, pacing, and branding across edits.\n\r\n\n\r\nWork with tight deadlines and “rush” projects while staying organized and calm.\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunicate clearly about timelines, questions, and potential issues so we never miss a delivery.\n\r\n\n\r\n4.

Day?to?Day\n\r\nA typical week might include:\n\r\n\n\r\nReceiving several projects with clear deadlines and simple creative direction.\n\r\n\n\r\nReviewing footage, identifying the best visuals and sound bites, and mapping a short story arc for each edit.\n\r\n\n\r\nWriting or refining hooks, on?screen text, and CTA frames that feel natural for real estate.\n\r\n\n\r\nEditing for multiple aspect ratios, with an emphasis on vertical content.\n\r\n\n\r\nDelivering final files, plus occasionally alternate versions (shorter cut, different hook, text/no text).\n\r\n\n\r\nHandling last?minute or rush edits when a client needs something turned around quickly (e.g., before a listing goes live).\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Requirements\n\r\nMust?haves\n\r\nProven track record editing short?form video (Reels, TikTok, Shorts) with a portfolio or reel.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience crafting story ideas, hooks, and structures that keep people watching, not just cutting clips together.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbility to work quickly and accurately, with short turnaround times and firm deadlines.\n\r\n\n\r\nDemonstrated ability to stay calm and professional under pressure.\n\r\n\n\r\nProficiency in a professional editing tool (Premiere Pro, Final Cut, or DaVinci Resolve).\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong sense of pacing, music, and visual flow.\n\r\n\n\r\nReliable internet and setup for fully remote work.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong communication skills and responsiveness in a remote environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nNice?to?haves\n\r\nExperience with real estate, architecture, or lifestyle content.\n\r\n\n\r\nBasic motion graphics skills (titles, callouts, simple transitions).\n\r\n\n\r\nFamiliarity with current trends and best practices for property content on social platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\n7. Who You Are\n\r\nYou might be a great fit if:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou think like a storyteller first and an editor second: you care about the hook, the arc, and the payoff.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou enjoy working fast and feel comfortable with deadlines and occasional last?minute requests.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re organized with your timelines, folders, and exports, even when juggling multiple projects.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou want your work to actually ship and be seen daily, not sit in drafts.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou like the idea of growing into more work (or full?time) as you prove reliability and quality.\n\r\n\n\r\n8.

This is not a \"back-office\" data entry role; you will be the architect of the financial tools our clients use to make multi-million dollar decisions. You will bridge the gap between complex data and strategic insights, building robust, audit-ready models from scratch.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\n• Model Architecture: Design, build, and maintain complex financial models (DCF, LBO, 3-Statement, Merger Models, and Budgeting/Forecasting tools) in Excel.\n\r\n• Client Advisory: Interface directly with clients to gather requirements, present findings, and explain model assumptions and sensitivities.\n\r\n• Scenario Analysis: Perform \"what-if\" analyses and stress testing to evaluate potential business outcomes and risks.\n\r\n• Data Integrity: Audit existing client models to identify errors, improve efficiency, and implement best practices in spreadsheet design (e.g., FAST Standard).\n\r\n• Reporting: Translate model outputs into executive-level PowerPoint presentations and dashboards.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Qualifications\n\r\n• Education: Bachelor’s degree in Finance, Accounting, Economics, or a related field. CPA or CFA (Level II or III) highly preferred.\n\r\n• Experience: 5+ years of experience in financial modeling, investment banking, corporate FP&A, or management consulting.\n\r\n• Technical Mastery: Advanced Excel skills (Power Query, VBA/Macros, complex nested formulas). Familiarity with Power BI or Tableau is a plus.\n\r\n• Communication: Exceptional English verbal and written communication skills—capable of explaining technical financial concepts to non-finance stakeholders.\n\r\n• Attention to Detail: An uncompromising commitment to accuracy and \"zero-error\" deliverables.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Benefits\n\r\nCompetitive Salary. pay out every every 16th and 1st. \n\r\nBenefits: 13th-month pay\n\r\nLeave: 8 days Holiday Leave plus 12 VL/SL (1 credit accrual per month).\n\r\nOther benefits: to be provided upon hire                ",

You will work closely with the clinic owner and an external UK-based virtual reception team, focusing on Dentally, data accuracy and keeping patients fully followed up. \n\r\n\n\r\nOpen to full time or part time. If part time, there needs to be room to expand into full time if workload requires it.\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a fully remote role (home-based) supporting a UK time zone, typically Monday–Friday (flexible on working hours as long as majority is within UK hours). You will not handle live phone calls; instead, you will be the \"engine room\" behind the scenes, managing Dentally, patient records, recalls and admin tasks so the clinical and reception teams can focus on patients.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role requires someone who can work proactively and independently in the background. You will need to be highly comfortable with data, CRM systems, and creating reports. A key part of your role is managing upwards – regularly communicating with clinicians and the reception team through clear reports and task lists, highlighting what needs attention and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\nDENTALLY & PATIENT DATA MANAGEMENT: \n\r\n\n\r\n- Log in to Dentally daily to review new patients and updates, checking that all new registrations are complete and accurate.\n\r\n- Check that new patient enquiries have been added correctly, have appointments booked, and have received their treatment plans and information.\n\r\n- Maintain excellent data hygiene: tidy records, consistent contact details, correct tags, accurate medical/dental history status (where provided by the clinic).\n\r\n- Create and manage tasks in Dentally for the reception team and clinicians (e.g. \"call to rebook,\" \"awaiting X-ray,\" \"send estimate\").\n\r\n- Build and maintain custom reports from Dentally data to support decision-making and identify trends or gaps.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nRECALLS, RACTIVATION AND FOLLOW-UP\n\r\n\n\r\n- Run recall and reactivation reports (exams, hygiene, and other key treatments) on an agreed schedule (e.g. daily/weekly).\n\r\n- Build and maintain structured recall lists (due, overdue, lapsed) and keep them up to date as patients book, cancel or decline.\n\r\n- Prepare daily call/WhatsApp lists for our UK reception partner, including notes and priority flags so they can efficiently contact patients.\n\r\n- Send recall and reminder messages \n/SMS/WhatsApp templates)

actionable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNEW PATIENT JOURNEY & TREATMENT PLAN TRACKING\n\r\n\n\r\n- Monitor new patient enquiries and consultations: check who has attended, who needs follow-up and who has not yet

I work remotely from Thailand (GMT+7). I'm looking for a reliable, detail-oriented Virtual Assistant to work with me full-time and help me stay focused on high-impact engineering and product work.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll take ownership of QA testing, research, document management, and general personal admin — the things that need to get done but don't need to be done by me. Think of this as being the right hand to a senior engineer at a fast-moving tech company.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a great role if you're curious about technology, enjoy variety in your work, and want to grow your skills in a tech startup environment. You don't need to be a developer, but you should be comfortable navigating web apps, spreadsheets, and picking up new tools quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Your timezone advantage:** I'm based in Thailand (GMT+7), just 1 hour behind the Philippines.

We're live with real users, preparing for rapid growth across Texas, and moving fast. Our stack is React/TypeScript on the frontend, Supabase (Postgres, Edge Functions, Auth, Storage, RLS) on the backend, Stripe Connect for payments, and Resend for transactional\n. Code lives in GitHub, and Loveable handles deployment — push to main and it auto-deploys.\n\r\nHow We Work\n\r\nWe use Claude Code as our primary development tool. You'll work from the terminal, running Claude Code against our codebase to build features, fix bugs, and ship changes. A CLAUDE.md project file already exists with our full architecture, database schema, RLS patterns, component conventions, and terminology rules — Claude Code reads it automatically every session. You won't be writing code from scratch most of the time. You'll be directing Claude Code with clear instructions, reviewing what it produces, and pushing to GitHub.\n\r\nIf you haven't used Claude Code before but you're comfortable in a terminal, can read React/TypeScript, and have worked with Supabase or similar — you'll pick it up fast. We'll walk you through setup on Day 1.\n\r\nDay 1: Setup\n\r\nYour first task is getting the development loop working:\n\r\n\n\r\nInstall Claude Code (one terminal command)\n\r\nAuthenticate with your Claude Pro or Max subscription\n\r\nClone our GitHub repo\n\r\nDrop in the CLAUDE.md project context file\n\r\nShip a small fix to prove the loop (we have a one-line database fix ready to go)\n\r\nConfirm push ? Loveable auto-deploy works\n\r\n\n\r\nHalf a day. After that, you're building.\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Shipping\n\r\nCurrent priorities, roughly in order:\n\r\n\n\r\nFix COPPA compliance bugs in the under-13 signup flow (fields not saving to the database, parent approval status not being set)\n\r\nFix Supabase auth\n branding (still shows old project name)\n\r\nResolve Yahoo\n authentication issue in Supabase config\n\r\nAdd\n logging to 9 edge functions\n\r\nFix cents-to-dollars conversion in admin payout dashboard\n\r\nAudit all edge functions for correct\n sender domain\n\r\nDeploy Knowledge Base (5 articles written, needs implementation)\n\r\nBuild \"Give Now\" immediate payment flow (full spec exists)\n\r\nBuild post-show charge automation with pg_cron\n\r\nBuild CSV Migration Assistant for importing existing records\n\r\nBuild Post-Show Analytics student dashboard\n\r\nHomepage redesign implementation\n\r\nPDF Record Book Export\n\r\nQA Admin Dashboard Phase 2 (7 modules shipped but untested)\n\r\n\n\r\nSpecs and detailed requirements exist for most of these. You're not designing — you're executing against clear specs with a powerful AI coding tool.\n\r\nOther Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\nRun QA scripts on mobile and desktop, document issues, verify fixes\n\r\nSupabase administration (migrations, RLS policies, Edge Functions, auth config, storage)\n\r\nStripe Connect monitoring and troubleshooting\n\r\nKeep backlog and documentation current in GitHub\n\r\nDNS/email deliverability management (Resend, SPF/DKIM/DMARC)\n\r\nPlausible Analytics monitoring for signup funnel health\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Not Looking For\n\r\nThis isn't a \"wait for instructions\" role. You'll have clear priorities and specs, but we need someone who flags when something doesn't look right, asks the right questions before burning hours, and closes loops without being chased.\n\r\nIdeal Candidate\n\r\n\n\r\nComfortable in a terminal and with git workflows\n\r\nCan read and navigate React/TypeScript (you don't need to write complex components from scratch — Claude Code handles that — but you need to understand what you're looking at)\n\r\nExperience with Supabase, Firebase, or similar BaaS platforms\n\r\nFamiliarity with Stripe Connect or Stripe payment integrations\n\r\nHas used AI-assisted dev tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Replit Agent, or similar) — or is eager to learn\n\r\nStrong written communication — you'll be reporting back to the founder and updating docs\n\r\nBonus: familiarity with agricultural youth programs, rural communities, or COPPA compliance\n\r\n\n\r\nDetails\n\r\n\n\r\n10–20 hours/week (flexible, varies by sprint)\n\r\nFully remote, US-based preferred\n\r\n$25–40/hr depending on experience\n\r\nOngoing engagement, minimum 3-month commitment\n\r\nYou'll need your own Claude Pro subscription ($20/mo) for Claude Code access\n\r\nTools provided: GitHub access, Supabase dashboard, Stripe dashboard, Loveable workspace, Resend account                ",

I am a solo founder building a US-based technology startup called DearlySent. We are building a social relationship network designed to bridge the gap between digital intention and physical action. My goal over the next decade is to serve 100 million monthly active users and fundamentally change the way human beings show care and love to one another.\n\r\n\n\r\nI personally work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, and I absolutely love what I do. I am intensely driven, but I cannot scale this alone. I am looking for my right-hand partner. I am looking for someone with high fluid intelligence, deep empathy, and a builder’s mindset to join me on the ground floor.\n\r\n\n\r\n**My Promise to You (The Anti-Micromanagement Guarantee):**\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a daycare. You are an adult, and you will be treated as a peer and a partner.\n\r\n\n\r\n- I will **never** use Time Doctor, Hubstaff, or any screen-recording software.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- I will **never** force you to punch a clock.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- I do not want your mechanical hours; I want your mind, your heart, and your soul. We will work in symbiosis to build something incredible. I care about output, execution, and trust.\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\n**The Trajectory & Compensation (The 4-Month Ramp):**\n\r\n\n\r\nI do not pay hourly, because I do not want you to have \"hours anxiety.\" If you build a system that saves us 10 hours a week, you should not be penalized with less pay. I pay a stable monthly salary for your output and ownership. We will scale your salary and your responsibilities together over the first four months:\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Month 1 (The Foundation): $800 USD / month.** Expectation is roughly 20 hours of focused output a week. You will learn the DNA of the company, help with Ritz-Carlton level customer care, execute rigorous QA testing of our app, and build our initial operations tracking.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Month 2 (The Builder): $1,200 USD / month.** Expectation grows to ~30 hours a week. You take over affiliate outreach, competitor research, manage video creators, and build our Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Month 3 (The Operator): $1,600 USD / month.** Nearing full-time. You take over daily operations so I can focus purely on engineering and marketing. You manage the digital fulfillment prep and own customer support.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Month 4+ (The Partner): $2,000 USD / month.** Full-time ownership. You are officially my Chief of Staff. You manage the systems, and when we are task-saturated and need to hire more people, _you_ will lead the interviews.\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\n**Long-Term Respect & Benefits:**\n\r\n\n\r\n- **13th Month Pay:** I proudly and proactively pay the 13th-month bonus every December.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Healthcare:** Once you reach Month 4 (Full Partner status), you will receive an additional $50/month stipend specifically for your local HMO.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Growth:** A guaranteed minimum 5% annual pay raise, with room for much higher performance-based increases as the company's revenue scales.\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\n**Who You Are:**\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Flawless English:** You will be communicating with our premium US customer base and directly with me.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Empathetic:** You actually care about people. Our company exists to remind people of their value.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **A Systems Thinker:** You don't just solve a problem; you build a system so the problem never happens again.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Tech-Savvy:** You embrace AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to make yourself faster and smarter.\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n### **How to Apply (The 3-Phase Hiring Process):**\n\r\n\n\r\nTo find the perfect partner, I do not read generic cover letters. We are breaking this process into three phases to ensure we are a perfect fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n**PHASE 1: The Introduction**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a resume or a cover letter. Instead, record a 3-to-5 minute video (Loom, YouTube, etc.) answering these three exact questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Explain a complex technical or operational problem you solved in the past.\n\r\n    \n\r\n2. Tell me about a specific act of kindness you’ve done for someone recently, or something kind you would like to do for someone.\n\r\n    \n\r\n3. What is a piece of technology or software that you believe is perfectly engineered, and why?\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\nAttention to Detail Check: Please make the subject line of your application message: \"Generosity: [Your Name]\" so I know you read this entire post).\n\r\nApplications without videos will be immediately deleted and not reviewed.  \n\r\n\n\r\n**PHASE 2: The Deep Dive**\n\r\n\n\r\nI will review every single video. The top candidates will be invited to Round 2, where I will ask you to record a second video detailing your specific background, your career ambitions, and more personal details about who you are. \n\r\n\n\r\n**PHASE 3: The Paid Trial**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe top finalists will be paid $50 USD to complete a real-world practice project for our company and take a brief alignment/personality assessment. You will be actively encouraged to use AI to complete this project.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe final candidate will be offered the position immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want to just clock in, do data entry, and clock out, please do not apply. If you want to build a unicorn startup, take ownership of a mission, and grow into a tech executive, send me your video. Let's build something incredible together.                ",

Handle updates, requests, timelines, and expectations so the founder isn't in every Slack thread and\n chain.\n\r\nProject management — Track all active builds across clients. Know what's on track, what's behind, and what's blocked — before anyone has to ask.\n\r\nScoping and QA — Review client requests, scope out what needs to be built, and QA completed n8n workflows and integrations before delivery. You don't need to be the best builder, but you need to understand what you're looking at.\n\r\nTeam management — Manage VAs and contractors. Assign tasks, review output, hold people accountable. Eventually, hire new tea\nmbers as we grow.\n\r\nBuilding systems — Create the SOPs, processes, and documentation that don't exist yet.

The PM Stack (Operations & Accountability)\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Goal: 100% On-time delivery.\n\r\nThe Skill: You have experience (preferably 2-3+ years) managing technical or creative teams. You are great at resource allocation, managing team velocity, and maintaining project management suites. You don't just \"check in\"; you drive the timeline.\n\r\n\n\r\n2.

You notice the misalignments, logic flaws, or broken elements on a website that everyone else misses.

You are a professional, direct communicator who can proactively communicate with clients.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Mindset\n\r\n\n\r\nHigh Agency: You don't wait for permission to fix a broken process.\n\r\nIntolerance of Mediocrity: You prioritize the end result.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication Instructions\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, submit your CV, your motivations for applying, and a brief overview of your relevant experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditionally, provide your tactical response to the following three scenarios:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. It’s Friday, 4:00 PM. A developer tells you a critical Shopify landing page build will be \"mostly ready\" by EOD, but they need Monday morning to \"clean up some minor mobile responsiveness issues.\" The client expects the launch on Monday at 9:00 AM. \n\r\n\n\r\n2. Our lead designer is brilliant, but consistently forgets to update changes across all pages in a project. You’ve mentioned it twice. Today, you found the same error again on a high-stakes project.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. A client messages you directly on a Friday evening asking for a \"small change\" after designs are approved and development is underway. You aren't sure if this aligns with the original strategy.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow do you handle each of these situations?\n\r\n\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you.                ",

The goal is clarity, retention, and strong narrative structure — not flashy effects.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is closer to a YouTube producer than a basic editor.\n\r\n\n\r\n-----\n\r\n\n\r\nWeekly Workflow:\n\r\n• Watch a full VOD (2–4 hours)\n\r\n• Identify one strong theme, struggle, or lesson worth expanding\n\r\n• Send 2–3 timestamps + a 1-sentence hook for approval\n\r\n• Edit a tight 8–15 minute long-form video\n\r\n• Remove unnecessary dead air while preserving natural tone\n\r\n• Shape pacing and structure for retention\n\r\n• Create a clean, CTR-focused thumbnail\n\r\n• Deliver via Drive (max 2 revision rounds)\n\r\n\n\r\nTarget: 1 high-quality video per week.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs trust builds and workflow tightens, video frequency can increase.\n\r\n\n\r\n-----\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I’m Looking For:\n\r\n• Experience editing long-form YouTube content (send links)\n\r\n• Strong understanding of hooks and retention psychology\n\r\n• Ability to commit to one clear thesis per video\n\r\n• Someone who understands conversational content — not over-edited\n\r\n• Good English reading comprehension\n\r\n• Reliable internet + ability to work async\n\r\n• Tools: Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve; Canva or Photoshop\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus if you understand livestream culture and community-driven content.\n\r\n\n\r\n-----\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Is NOT:\n\r\n• Not short-form repurposing\n\r\n• Not subtitle-heavy editing\n\r\n• Not fast-turnaround quantity work\n\r\n• Not effect-heavy montage style\n\r\n\n\r\nJudgment and taste matter more than transitions.\n\r\n\n\r\n-----\n\r\n\n\r\nPay:\n\r\n• $50–75 CAD per long-form video (depending on experience and trial quality)\n\r\n• 1 video per week to start\n\r\n• Increased frequency available as consistency and autonomy are proven\n\r\n• Paid trial video\n\r\n• Performance bonuses for strong CTR & retention\n\r\n• Long-term rate increases with results\n\r\n\n\r\nI’m looking for a long-term collaboration, not short-term rotation.\n\r\n\n\r\n-----\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\n– Send 2–3 long-form YouTube videos you’ve edited.\n\r\n– In 2–3 sentences, explain what makes a calm, conversational video retain viewers.\n\r\n– One sentence: Why are you the best fit for this role?\n\r\n\n\r\nIf your work and answers stand out, I will move you to a pre-screening stage, where you’ll receive a real Twitch VOD and be tested on your ability to create a strong thematic narrative suitable for YT videos.\n\r\n\n\r\nSalamat, usap tayo.\n\r\n\n\r\nChris                ",

We are heavy users of Claude Code and Cursor, and we expect you to leverage these tools alongside our team to push the absolute limits of frontend engineering.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: This is strictly an engineering role.

I spent 20 years at Procter & Gamble and left recently to build my own businesses. I’m now growing a personal brand on LinkedIn, running consulting projects, building a coaching practice, and organizing a TEDx event.\n\n\n\nThings are moving fast. But I’m doing too much myself, and the things I’m doing manually are things that someone with real experience could do faster and better.\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about me here: \n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE\n\n\n\nThe work has three elements to it:\n\n• Content and design — creating LinkedIn carousels, infographics, lead magnets, and other visual content in Canva or Figma. Scheduling, repurposing, and helping grow my presence on LinkedIn.\n\n• Operations and project management —\n marketing, SOPs, project tracking, keeping tools and systems organized. You keep things from falling apart so I can focus on clients and content.\n\n• Personal support — calendar, travel, family coordination, reminders.\n\nAs the business grows, the role will evolve. I need someone who’s excited by that, not threatened by it.\n\n\n\nAI PROFICIENCY IS ESSENTIAL\n\nI use AI daily. I expect you to use AI tools as a multiplier in everything you do.\n\n• When I ask you to research 20 podcast hosts, you don’t spend 8 hours Googling. You use AI to build an initial list in 30 minutes, then spend your time verifying it.\n\n• When you draft a message, you use AI to generate options, then apply your judgment to pick and refine the best one.\n\n• When we need a new SOP, you use AI to draft the framework, then refine it based on reality.\n\n\n\nAI handles the 60% that’s mechanical. You handle the 40% that requires judgment, creativity, taste, and human connection. Together we operate like a team of 5.\n\n\n\nWhat Makes This Role Different\n\nI’m not looking for someone who waits for instructions. I’m looking for someone who:\n\n• Brings expertise I don’t have. You’ve supported creators or entrepreneurs before. You see me about to make a mistake you’ve seen before and you say something.\n\n• Gets things in order.
