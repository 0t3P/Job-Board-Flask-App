We help our clients grow through paid advertising, strong backend systems, and disciplined execution. \n\r\nOur team uses a specialist model — media buying, creative, client success, sales, and technical work are handled by experts. This role exists to ensure execution stays organized, systems function properly, and nothing falls through the cracks.\n\r\n\n\r\nRole Overview\n\r\nWe are looking for a highly organized, detail-driven Business Operations & Fulfillment Coordinator to support day-to-day delivery, onboarding, and operational execution across our client accounts and internal systems.\n\r\nThis is an implementation and coordination role, not a strategy or leadership position. You will not be responsible for developing marketing strategy or making company-level decisions. Instead, your responsibility is to ensure that plans are executed correctly, systems function as intended, tasks are fully completed, documentation and SOPs are up-to-date and accurate, and work moves smoothly and efficiently between tea\nmbers without breakdowns.\n\r\nYou will translate direction into action; verify that execution meets standards; maintain clean documentation and workflows; and help ensure that nothing falls through the cracks. Success in this role means our specialists can focus on their areas of expertise, because the operational engine behind them is organized, accurate, and consistently moving forward.\n\r\nThink of this role as the coordinator of execution — keeping the systems, tools, and day-to-day work running reliably as the company grows.\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Style & Expectations\n\r\nThis role operates in a fast-paced agency environment where priorities move quickly, and multiple projects run simultaneously. You will be expected to:\n\r\nProactively follow up and drive work forward, rather than wait for direction\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAsk clarifying questions when needed, then take ownership of execution (thinking two steps ahead to achieve a lasting, long-term solution, not a band-aid fix) \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nManage many small details across multiple accounts, without losing accuracy\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIdentify when something is incomplete, unclear, or broken — and help resolve it fast\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nKeep systems, documentation, and workflows clean and up to date as part of daily work\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSuccess in this role comes from being organized, responsive, and persistent in ensuring tasks are truly finished — not just started.\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Responsibilities\n\r\n1.

Quality Assurance & Execution Verification\n\r\nQA campaigns, workflows, builds, and integrations before and after launch (requires extremely high attention to detail so errors are caught before going live)  \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTest automations, lead routing, and tracking to confirm functionality\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nConfirm work is fully resolved before closing tasks\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPerform routine operational checks to ensure nothing is stuck or incomplete\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n4.

Those are handled by our marketing leads and specialists.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNot a leadership or people-management position — you will coordinate work, but you will not conduct employee reviews, hire/fire, or be responsible for any one department’s performance.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNot responsible for company-level or client-level decision-making — your role is to implement, verify, and support execution based on defined direction.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNot an accounting or bookkeeping role — you may help coordinate payments and maintain trackers, but you will not perform bookkeeper-level financial reporting, reconciliation, or do accounting work.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNot a build-from-scratch systems architect role — you will help improve and maintain existing processes but won’t be expected to design entirely new operational structures on your own.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNot responsible for performing accounting work, preparing financial statements, or filing taxes — you will help facilitate communication and documentation with our bookkeeper and CPA.\n\r\nThis is a hands-on coordination and execution role focused on accuracy, follow-through, and operational consistency — ensuring that plans are carried out correctly and systems continue to run reliably regardless of who is executing them.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role Matters\n\r\nThis position ensures our specialists can focus on their expertise while execution stays organized, systems remain clean, and clients receive consistent delivery.\n\r\nIf you enjoy structured work, improving processes, and keeping complex operations moving, this role is a strong fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply:\n\r\nSend us your resume with a 1-3 minute Loom video explaining why you’re a great fit for this role. \n\r\nPut “Ricky Bobby” in the subject line.

    "description": "\n                    Ikigai Cases is hiring for a Director of Supply Chain\n\r\nLocation: Remote\n\r\nCompensation: $3500 per month + performance-based bonuses\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Company\n\r\nIkigai Cases (\n) is a fast-growing ecommerce brand manufacturing aerospace-grade aluminum pill cases. Founded in December 2021 by two brothers after their father's neurological diagnosis led them to discovering the issues with plastic pill organizers, we've built a multi-million dollar business in just over four years with a team of 25 across the globe. \n\r\n\n\r\nOur mission is simple: make exceptional pill cases and provide exceptional customer service. We deliver on this by managing in-house fulfillment at our Washington, DC facility (including custom engraving) and maintaining obsessive attention to detail.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\nWe are hiring a Director of Supply Chain to take complete ownership of our supply chain function — strategy, execution, team development, and results. If you've scaled ecommerce/DTC supply chains before and want full autonomy to run a supply chain like your own business unit, this is the role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll inherit a solid operational foundation including a capable team of two (Supply Chain Manager and Demand Planner), and your mandate is to turn supply chain operations at Ikigai Cases into a well-oiled machine. We expect you to come into the company and systematically reduce costs, build scalable systems, and eliminate fires before they reach leadership.\n\r\nThis is a role where you're expected to bring your own vision, not execute someone else's — you'll diagnose what needs to happen, build the roadmap, and drive measurable improvements every quarter without needing direction.\n\r\n\n\r\n5 Core Responsibilities\n\r\nSupply Chain Strategy & Execution Ownership: Own the supply chain function end-to-end with complete strategic and operational accountability. Build the roadmap from current state to future scale, execute autonomously, and deliver quarterly results without needing direction or validation.\n\r\n\n\r\nProactive Problem Resolution & Crisis Management: Eliminate supply chain fires before they reach leadership—vendor delays, tariff chaos, customs nightmares, stockout risks. Handle all escalations decisively through strong vendor relationships, creative problem-solving, and systems that prevent recurring issues.\n\r\n\n\r\nCost Optimization & Continuous Improvement: Systematically drive down landed costs, optimize vendor terms, and improve operational efficiency quarter over quarter. Deliver measurable cost reductions and margin improvements through strategic sourcing, freight optimization, tariff mitigation strategies, and process excellence.\n\r\n\n\r\nSupply Chain System Builder: Design and implement world-class demand planning, inventory management, vendor partnerships, and operational processes that scale seamlessly through aggressive growth. Build the infrastructure that turns chaotic firefighting into predictable, bulletproof operations.\n\r\n\n\r\nTeam Leadership & Development: Manage and significantly elevate our Supply Chain Manager and Demand Planner through coaching, systems, and clear accountability. Take full ownership of their performance and growth, scale the team strategically as needed, hire A-players, and maintain consistently high standards across all supply chain operations.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy You Should Take This Role\n\r\n-You’ll be working at a brand that is obsessed with their customers and has built a loyal following. Just read a few of their reviews: \n\r\n-You'll be working at a company that has scaled rapidly in just 4 years and is aggressively investing in growth. Our goal is to make the best pill cases in the world.\n\r\n-You’ll be working with people who have extreme levels of competitive fire in their bellies - people who will run through walls to make sure the company succeeds.\n\r\n-You'll work hand-in-hand with the founder, not through layers of management, with full autonomy to own your domain.\n\r\n-You’ll be working to make people’s lives easier with products they’ll use every single day. The company was founded to solve a personal problem Tavish’s father had with his pill organizers while battling a neurological condition for a decade. \n\r\n-You’ll be working on a complex, truly unique supply chain - aerospace-grade aluminum manufacturing, in-house engraving, international freight, tariff strategy, high-velocity product releases. \n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Experience & Skills Experience\n\r\n-7+ years of total supply chain experience in DTC/ecommerce brands\n\r\n-3+ years as a Director of Supply Chain (or equivalent leadership role with full functional ownership)\n\r\n-Hard goods manufacturing experience (metal, durability products, consumer goods - NOT apparel/soft goods only)\n\r\n-International manufacturing management (Asia-US supply chains)\n\r\n-Proven measurable cost reduction achievements\n\r\n-Has managed supply chain teams (3+ people)\n\r\n-Has navigated major supply chain crises (tariffs, COVID, vendor failures)\n\r\n-Must be based outside the United States.\n\r\n\n\r\nNice-to-Have Experience\n\r\n-CNC Machining / Aerospace-Grade Aluminum / Anodizing supply chain experience\n\r\n-Experience with in-house fulfillment operations (not just outsourced 3PL)\n\r\n-EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System) familiarity\n\r\n-High-velocity product launch experience (monthly or faster launch cadence)\n\r\n-Multi-country sourcing experience (supplier diversification strategies)\n\r\n-Multi-channel fulfillment experience (DTC, Amazon, wholesale/retail)\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation Details\n\r\n-Compensation: $3500 per month + performance-based bonuses\n\r\n-Work Hours: 50 hours per week, flexible scheduling to meet needs of the role\n\r\n-Paid Holidays: 10 paid holidays per year\n\r\n-PTO: 1 week earned for every 6 months worked at the company\n\r\n-Location: Remote / Work From Home\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply\n\r\nFill out the application form here: \n\r\n\n\r\nThis application includes a number of questions in order to ensure we hire an outstanding candidate for this position, so please be advised in advance that it will take time to complete.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications are reviewed on a rolling basis.

    "description": "\n                    **To apply, please upload an updated copy of your resume as well as a 2-3 minute video detailing your experience. \n\r\n\n\r\nRole Overview\n\r\nWe’re hiring an exceptional Executive Assistant to support the Chief Operating Officer of a fast-growing, multi-site services business. The COO runs the operational engine: field execution, staffing/scheduling, compliance, service quality, and cross-functional performance.\n\r\n \n\r\nThis role is for someone who can operate as a COO “air-traffic controller” — protecting time, closing loops, driving follow-through, and ensuring nothing critical drops across a high-volume environment.\n\r\nThis is not a “calendar only” role.\n\r\n \n\r\nYou are building leverage. You are running systems. You are the COO’s execution layer.\n\r\nYou will handle both professional and select personal responsibilities to reduce friction and keep the COO operating at peak effectiveness. You will be trusted with sensitive information and expected to exercise sound judgment.\n\r\n \n\r\nCore Responsibilities\n\r\n1) Calendar Management & Time Protection (Primary)\n\r\n• Own and optimize a complex calendar across operational leadership cadence (daily/weekly/monthly).\n\r\n• Schedule with intent: deep work blocks, site/branch time, leadership check-ins, buffer time, travel recovery.\n\r\n• Proactively gatekeep: decline/redirect low-value meetings and clarify purpose/outcomes before booking.\n\r\n• Coordinate multi-party scheduling across SLT, regional leaders, HR, finance, compliance, vendors.\n\r\n• Build and maintain recurring rhythms:\n\r\no Weekly operating reviews\n\r\no KPI/scorecard meetings\n\r\no I\n/escalation reviews\n\r\no Hiring/people reviews\n\r\no Site visits / branch reviews\n\r\n• Maintain a rolling 2–4 week lookahead and flag conflicts early.\n\r\n• Ensure every meeting has: objective, attendees, prep, agenda, materials, and next steps.\n\r\nOutputs you own: weekly schedule plan, daily run-of-show, meeting cadence map.\n\r\n2) Inbox Triage & Communications Command Center\n\r\n• Triage COO inbox daily:\n\r\no Sort, flag, archive, respond where appropriate\n\r\no Draft replies in COO voice for approval\n\r\no Escalate only what requires COO decision\n\r\n• Maintain a follow-up tracker and chase responses relentlessly.\n\r\n• Coordinate responses across internal stakeholders to keep the COO out of thread chaos.\n\r\n• Identify patterns in communication breakdowns and fix the system (not just the\n).\n\r\n• Manage sensitive/confidential communications with discretion.\n\r\nNon-negotiable: nothing important goes unanswered or forgotten.\n\r\n3) Follow-Ups, Action Items, and “Close-the-Loop” Execution\n\r\n• Attend select meetings to capture action items, owners, deadlines (or request notes fro\neting owners and systematize).\n\r\n• Maintain an operational action log:\n\r\no Decisions made\n\r\no Open items\n\r\no Due dates\n\r\no Accountability check-ins\n\r\n• Proactively follow up with leaders to drive completion.\n\r\n• Escalate when blockers persist and propose options, not problems.\n\r\n• Ensure key commitments made by operations are documented and executed.\n\r\n4) Project Coordination & Cross-Functional Ops Support\n\r\n• Support COO on core operational initiatives (examples):\n\r\no Process standardization / SOP rollouts\n\r\no Onboarding improvements\n\r\no Staffing/scheduling efficiency projects\n\r\no Quality assurance and i\n tracking\n\r\no Compliance documentation workflows\n\r\no Vendor implementations (software, payroll, etc.)\n\r\n• Coordinate project meetings, maintain timelines, track deliverables.\n\r\n• Prepare brief status updates (1-pagers) so COO can see the whole board quickly.\n\r\n• Track dependencies across HR, Finance, Compliance, Clinical, Recruiting, Scheduling.\n\r\nThis is coordination + pressure-testing, not “project management theater.”\n\r\n5) Prep Materials, Briefing Packs & Meeting Excellence\n\r\n• Create and distribute briefing packets in advance:\n\r\no KPI snapshots / dashboards (from ops analytics/CFO team)\n\r\no Agenda and desired outcomes\n\r\no Key context and risks\n\r\no Prior meeting notes and unresolved items\n\r\n• Ensure the COO walks into every meeting prepared:\n\r\no correct documents\n\r\no latest numbers\n\r\no known landmines\n\r\no decision points highlighted\n\r\n• Organize, version-control, and file meeting materials cleanly.\n\r\n6) Travel & Logistics (White-Glove, Efficient)\n\r\n• Plan and manage business travel:\n\r\no flights, hotels, car services, site visit routing\n\r\no itineraries with confirmations and contingency plans\n\r\n• Build travel to maximize productivity:\n\r\no cluster meetings by geography\n\r\no add buffers for delays\n\r\no ensure time for prep and follow-ups\n\r\n• Coordinate occasional personal/family travel as requested.\n\r\n• Handle last-minute changes without drama.\n\r\n• Maintain loyalty accounts, preferences, and travel profiles.\n\r\n7) Vendor & External Stakeholder Communication\n\r\n• Act as coordinator for operational vendors and partners:\n\r\no scheduling calls\n\r\no collecting proposals\n\r\no routing contracts for review/signature\n\r\no tracking deliverables and renewals\n\r\n• Manage vendor communications professionally and promptly.\n\r\n• Track contracts, renewal dates, and service issues.\n\r\n• Ensure COO has clean decision memos: options, pricing, recommendation.\n\r\n8) Personal Responsibilities (Selective, High-Impact)\n\r\nTo protect COO focus, this role includes targeted personal support, such as:\n\r\n• Manage personal calendar integration.\n\r\n• Coordinate family schedules and logistics.\n\r\n• Schedule medical/dental appointments.\n\r\n• Coordinate household vendors (maintenance, contractors, services).\n\r\n• Manage gifting (holidays, birthdays, business relationships).\n\r\n• Assist with special projects (events, trips, milestone celebrations).\n\r\n• Maintain confidential personal documentation.\n\r\n• Track key dates (anniversaries, deadlines, renewals).\n\r\n• Ensure personal finances/admin tasks stay organized.\n\r\nScope is reasonable, but the goal is the same: eliminate friction.\n\r\nRequired Qualifications\n\r\n• 5+ years supporting a senior executive (COO/CEO/President) in a high-tempo environment.\n\r\n• Mastery of Outlook (calendar + inbox systems).\n\r\n• Strong written communication and executive judgment.\n\r\n• Proven ability to manage competing priorities without dropping details.\n\r\n• Experience coordinating projects, deadlines, and stakeholders across departments.\n\r\n• Absolute discretion with confidential information.\n\r\n• Calm under pressure; high ownership; low ego.\n\r\nPreferred\n\r\n• Experience in healthcare services, home care, staffing-heavy businesses, multi-site operations, or regulated industries.\n\r\n• Familiarity with Teams, SharePoint/OneDrive, Asana/Notion/ClickUp, CRM tools.\n\r\n• Comfort working with data/KPI summaries (you don’t need to be an analyst, but you must be fluent).\n\r\nTraits That Matter Here (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n• Proactive to the point of annoying (in a good way).\n\r\n• Detail-obsessed but not precious.\n\r\n• Fast and accurate.\n\r\n• Strong backbone with tact.\n\r\n• High emotional intelligence.\n\r\n• Systems thinker: fixes root causes, not symptoms.\n\r\n• Can handle intensity without taking it personally.\n\r\n• Naturally closes loops and hates loose ends.

A Technical Operator who obsessed over ROI?\n\r\n\n\r\nIf so, I want to hire you immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are the elite in the real estate space, and we are looking for a Performance Media Buyer to own our client fulfillment. This is not a \"task-based\" job. This is a results-based partnership.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE MISSION:\n\r\n\n\r\nYour #1 priority is to ensure our real estate agents are drowning in high-quality, booked appointments. You will be responsible for the initial lifecycle of the lead: from the first impression on\n to the lead being qualified in GoHighLevel.\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR HIGH-LEVERAGE TASKS\n\r\n\n\r\nMedia Buying Excellence: Launching, managing, and scaling Meta Ads (FB/IG) specifically for Real Estate. You know how to pivot when CPL rises and how to double down on winners.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Creative Leverage: Using AI to rapidly produce ad copy and creatives that stop the scroll. No boring ads.\n\r\n\n\r\nTechnical Fulfillment: Executing full client onboarding. This means deploying GHL Snapshots, setting up FB Lead Forms, and ensuring the automation \"plumbing\" is leak-proof.\n\r\n\n\r\nData Integrity: Tracking every metric (CPL, CPM, CTR, Show-up Rate) in our master Sheets. If it isn't tracked, it didn't happen.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE TECH STACK\n\r\nExpert Level: Meta Ads Manager, GoHighLevel (Workflows & Snapshots).\n\r\n\n\r\nAutomation: Zapier / N8N (Chaining tools to increase speed).\n\r\n\n\r\nAI: Deep knowledge of prompting ChatGPT/Gemini to write high-converting real estate scripts.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n\r\nSpeed is #1: You move faster than the competition. \"Good and fast\" beats \"perfect and slow.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nExtreme Ownership: If an ad set fails, you don't wait for me to tell you. You diagnose the constraint and fix it.\n\r\n\n\r\nFluent English: Radical transparency and clear communication are mandatory.\n\r\n\n\r\nTechnical Power: You own a 64-bit computer and a stable, high-speed internet connection.\n\r\n\n\r\nAvailability: Must be available at least 2-4 hours per day (to start) within US Timezones for syncs.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY MOST PEOPLE FAIL AT THIS ROLE:\n\r\n\n\r\nMost Mediabuyers need to be micro-managed. If you need people to hold your hand or give you a \"to-do list\" every morning, do not apply. \n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY (FOLLOW EXACTLY)\n\r\n\n\r\nSend an\n to \n Line: “Killer Media Buyer for Realty Rulers”\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: We are an AI-first operation and have been leveraging these tools daily for 2+ years.

Forms that are not completed or only partially completed will not be considered. In the form you’ll be asked your age.

My personal brand site (\n) promotes my sci-fi book, gallery of cosmic/AI art, blog/content, comedy/media explorations, and future automation/creation services.\n\r\nRight now, the site feels wonky, outdated, and disjointed – navigation is clunky, flow doesn't guide visitors smoothly from landing ? book/art discovery ? about/connect, mobile responsiveness could be better, and overall it lacks the polished, immersive, high-vibe energy that matches the themes of transformation, chaos-to-pattern, and raw truth.\n\r\nI need a skilled VA to take full ownership of a complete redesign and overhaul. This is not just minor tweaks – it's a fresh structure, better user journey, modern aesthetics, and improved functionality to convert visitors into book buyers, art fans, newsletter subscribers, or future collaborators \n\r\nAudit the current site (likely WordPress-based) and propose a clear redesign plan: new sitemap, page flow, visual style guide aligned with \"radical authenticity + 417Hz cosmic vibe\" (dark mode options? immersive elements? subtle animations?).\n\r\nRebuild/restructure the site with clean, modern WordPress setup:\n\r\nIntuitive navigation and hero sections that hook immediately (e.g., book promo + art teaser + tagline).\n\r\nSmooth flow: Home ? The Seventh Stone (shop links, excerpts, experience) ? Cosmic Art Gallery (enhanced visuals, categories) ? About (deeper bio/story) ? Blog/Cosmic posts ? Connect \n signup, contact form).\n\r\n\n\r\nImprove mobile/desktop responsiveness and speed (optimize images, plugins, etc.).\n\r\nIntegrate or enhance key features: e-commerce/book purchase links (IngramSpark/Amazon),\n capture (e.g., Mailchimp or similar), gallery/portfolio display for AI art, basic SEO tweaks (meta, alt text, slugs).\n\r\nUpdate content/copy where needed for better engagement (I can provide direction; you handle implementation).\n\r\nTest thoroughly for bugs, broken links, and cross-browser compatibility.\n\r\n\n\r\nMonthly maintenance, content updates (new blog posts, art additions, book promos).\n\r\nHelp with expansions: possible membership area, automation integrations (e.g., Zapier for workflows), or tying in future projects (comedy clips, media).\n\r\nCollaborate creatively – suggest improvements, mood boards, or tools that fit the brand.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Skills & Experience:\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong WordPress expertise (themes like Astra/GeneratePress + Elementor/Beaver Builder/Gutenberg; custom CSS/PHP if needed).\n\r\nProven experience redesigning/overhauling personal/portfolio/creative sites (portfolio or examples required – show before/after!).\n\r\nGood eye for modern, artistic design – clean, immersive, dark/cosmic aesthetics preferred (not corporate/boring).\n\r\nSolid understanding of user flow & UX – how to guide visitors emotionally and toward actions (buy book, view art, connect).\n\r\nBasic graphic editing (Canva/Photoshop for resizing art, creating banners).\n\r\nReliable, proactive communicator – use Slack/Email/Loom for updates; weekly check-ins.\n\r\nBonus (not required but big plus): Experience with e-commerce plugins (WooCommerce),\n marketing tools, basic SEO, or AI/art-related sites.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I'm Looking For in You:\n\r\n\n\r\nHigh ID Proof and/or IQ Score (110+) preferred for trust and quick learning.\n\r\nCreative mindset – you get \"radical authenticity\" and can bring bold ideas without overstepping.\n\r\nSelf-starter who can work independently but asks smart questions.\n\r\nLong-term mindset – this could grow into a core role as my brand expands.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\nReply with:\n\r\n\n\r\nYour hourly rate expectation.\n\r\nWeekly availability (hours/time zone – I'm in Playa del Carmen, MX, so flexible overlap helpful).\n\r\nLink to 2–3 relevant WordPress redesign examples (before/after screenshots or live sites).\n\r\nA short note on why this project excites you (bonus if you mention the book's themes or 417Hz vibe!).\n\r\nYour OnlineJobs.ph profile link.\n\r\n\n\r\nLooking forward to finding the right person to help turn chaos into a killer digital blueprint.

    "description": "\n                    We’re hiring people to manage daily activity on Reddit, including posting content and interacting within communities. This is ongoing work and requires someone who actually understands how Reddit functions, not just how to scroll it.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll need atleast 3+ devices (Android only). If you own multiple devices, that’s a plus and allows you to earn more. Expect roughly one hour of work per device each day.\n\r\n\n\r\nEach day you’ll post content across several subreddits.\n\r\n\n\r\nA critical part of this role is reading the room. The videos we provide can range from humorous to emotional to awkward or uncomfortable. You need to instantly recognize the tone and write posts that feel natural for that type of content. If you post everything the same way, you’ll fail.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll also be responsible for finding appropriate subreddits for each video. That means reviewing community rules, understanding what performs well there, and making sure your post doesn’t look forced or out of place. If you can’t do that consistently, this position isn’t for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re looking for people who think independently, adapt fast, and don’t need their hand held. Prior Reddit experience is helpful but not mandatory if you learn quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a long-term opportunity for dependable workers. Compensation is solid and can increase based on results and how many devices you use.\n\r\n\n\r\nEarnings:\n\r\nMost contributors earn $100–$500 per month, depending on consistency and the number of devices used.\n\r\n\n\r\nTime Commitment:\n\r\nDaily time commitment ranges from about 1 to 5 hours, depending on how many devices you’re using\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, include:\n\r\n• how many devices you can work with\n\r\n• your experience using Reddit\n\r\n• when you’re available each day                ",

As we scale significantly this year, we are looking for a candidate who represents our brand with authority, dedication, and a \"customer-first\" mindset.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor the right person, this role offers substantial growth opportunities within our company. You will follow a clear, streamlined process that ensures our customers receive elite support every time they reach out.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Technical Knowledge:\n\r\n- Shopify (Order management and customer data)\n\r\n- Slack (Internal team communication)\n\r\n- Google Drive / Gmail (Documentation and correspondence)\n\r\n- ChatGPT/AI LLM's (Assisting with high-quality, efficient responses)\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities:\n\r\n- Inquiry Management: Responding to customer\ns regarding order tracking, refunds, and technical product FAQs.\n\r\n- Speed & Accuracy: Maintaining a 16-hour response time (ETA) with precise, professional communication.\n\r\n- Reporting: Providing updates on refund trends and common customer complaints.\n\r\n- Process Improvement: Contributing to our internal documentation (SOPs) to help us sharpen our support operations.\n\r\n- Professionalism: Representing a tactical brand with a calm, helpful, and direct communication style.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Provide:\n\r\n- Comprehensive training modules.\n\r\n- Clear Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for every scenario.\n\r\n- Direct access to our Lead Customer Support for mentorship and questions.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplicant Requirements:\n\r\n- Experience: Minimum 1 year in E-commerce Customer Support.\n\r\n- Language: Fluent written and verbal English (Native or C1 level).\n\r\n- Commitment: This is a long-term role. You must be available for team calls and active in Slack.\n\r\n- Attention to Detail: We have zero tolerance for \"lazy\" support (e.g., sending the same\n twice, imprecise answers, or off-topic responses).\n\r\n- Digital office: Fast internet, fast computer/laptop, no outages.\n\r\n- Availability: Must be available to start immediately and not currently holding another full-time position.\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Schedule & Trial Period:\n\r\nPhase 1: A two-week paid trial period with extensive training.\n\r\nPhase 2: Transition to Part-Time (minimum 18 hours per week to start, scaling up as needed).\n\r\nPhase 3: Transition to Full-Time (30+ hours)\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\nPlease submit your proposal and include:\n\r\n- A brief summary of your previous experience in e-commerce support.\n\r\n- Why you believe you are the right fit for a high-standard e-commerce brand.\n\r\n- Confirmation that you can meet our 16-hour response time requirement.\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd please answer on these screening questions:\n\r\n\n\r\nQuestion 1\n\r\nIt's Tuesday morning. You open the inbox and see 14 unanswered\ns. 3 of them are close to hitting the 16-hour window. 4 are from the same customer who sent follow-ups. 2 are complaints about a product defect you've never seen reported before. The rest are general inquiries. Walk me through exactly what you do in the next 30 minutes, in order.\n\r\n\n\r\nQuestion 2\n\r\nA customer\ns saying they want a refund. You check the order: they are outside the refund window by 2 days, but they've ordered from Stonewall 4 times before. There is no policy exception for loyal customers written in the SOPs. What do you do, and what do you say to them?\n\r\n\n\r\nQuestion 3\n\r\nA customer\ns: 'Hi, I placed an order 3 weeks ago, order #\n. I just want to know where it is.' They say nothing else. But when you check the order, it shows delivered 10 days ago. Write the\n you would send back.\n\r\n\n\r\nQuestion 5 \n\r\nYou've been on shift for 6 hours. It's been a frustrating day: two difficult customers in a row, a system glitch that lost one of your drafted replies, and you just found out a colleague submitted incorrect tracking info to 7 customers, and those tickets are now landing in your queue to fix. How are you actually feeling right now, and what do you do next?\n\r\n\n\r\nWe look forward to hearing from you.                ",
