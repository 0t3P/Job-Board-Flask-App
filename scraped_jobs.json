We arrange private jet charters and manage jet card memberships for high-net-worth clients who expect white-glove service every single time.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're hiring a Flight Operations Assistant & Client Concierge to join our small, tight-knit team.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT THE ROLE LOOKS LIKE:\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a typical 9-to-5. Private aviation runs on the client's schedule, not ours. We need coverage during US business hours, and when things get hectic — which they will — we operate on a global clock. That means late nights, early mornings, and weekend availability when flights are moving. It's not always easy, but it's the nature of the business and we're upfront about it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen request volume is high, you'll be slammed — coordinating flights, fielding client requests at odd hours, and juggling multiple moving pieces across time zones. When things slow down, we don't coast. Quieter periods are when we focus on operational perfection: tightening SOPs, re-engaging past clients, building out systems, and making sure we're sharper for the next wave.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou need to be someone who thrives in that rhythm. We work as a family here. Everyone is a hustler. We get things done and we take ownership.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Support flight operations: coordinate with aircraft operators, manage trip logistics, handle itinerary changes, and ensure every detail is locked down before wheels up\n\r\n- Serve as a concierge-level point of contact for our clients — ground transportation, hotel bookings, catering requests, special arrangements, and anything else that makes their experience seamless\n\r\n- Communicate proactively with clients and operators via\n, WhatsApp, and phone\n\r\n- Maintain and update records in our CRM (HubSpot) and trip management systems\n\r\n- Assist with quoting, invoicing follow-ups, and post-trip reporting\n\r\n- During slower periods: lead client re-engagement outreach, build and refine operational checklists and SOPs, and improve internal systems and workflows\n\r\n- Jump in wherever needed — we're a small team and everyone wears multiple hats\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Proven experience in travel concierge, luxury hospitality, VIP client services, or private aviation support\n\r\n- You have a network and knowledge of high-end travel logistics — hotels, ground transport, restaurants, experiences\n\r\n- Available to work US time zones and flexible enough to extend hours when operations demand it\n\r\n- Process-oriented: you build checklists, you follow up without being asked, you don't let things fall through the cracks\n\r\n- Excellent written and spoken English — you'll be communicating directly with clients and operators\n\r\n- Tech-savvy: comfortable with CRMs, spreadsheets, messaging platforms, and learning new tools quickly\n\r\n- Self-starter who takes initiative — if you see something that needs doing, you do it\n\r\n\n\r\nNICE TO HAVE:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience with HubSpot, Avinode, or aviation industry tools\n\r\n- Background in private aviation, charter operations, or FBO services\n\r\n- Experience managing high-net-worth or celebrity clientele\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a full-time role with variable intensity. When it's go-time, we need you all in. When it's quiet, we trust you to stay productive, sharp, and focused on making the operation better.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're someone who takes pride in delivering exceptional service and wants to be part of a growing aviation company where your work actually matters — we want to hear from you.
