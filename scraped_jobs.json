    "description": "\n                    JOB TITLE: Short-Form Video Editor — AI Content Creator, Instagram/TikTok\n\r\nSALARY: $1,100 USD/month\n\r\nTYPE: Full-time (40 hours/week)\n\r\nLOCATION: Remote (Philippines)\n\r\nSCHEDULE: Async, with Vancouver overlap (PST) for feedback\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE MISSION\n\r\n\n\r\nPrismiera is a luxury jewelry brand with a short-form video series already producing cinematic content on YouTube — mythology, history, goddess archetypes, and Dark Academia aesthetics.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone to own the Instagram and TikTok side.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT repurposing YouTube content into different aspect ratios. This is building platform-native content that makes a woman feel powerful in under 20 seconds. You'll create original short-form edits and cinematic skits using AI-generated footage, voiceovers, and atmospheric visuals — designed from the ground up for how Instagram and TikTok audiences actually consume.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe other half of this role: you'll be working with our AI-generated personas who serve as the visual anchor across our short-form content. You'll generate, composite, integrate, and stylize AI character visuals into edits that feel striking and intentional, not gimmicky. If the idea of building a visual identity around an AI persona excites you, keep reading!\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE STYLE\n\r\n\n\r\nThe content mix you'll produce:\n\r\n\n\r\n65% VIBE & SCENARIO — The kind of reel a woman sends to her group chat with no caption because the vibe speaks for itself.\n\r\n\n\r\n25% CINEMATIC SKITS — High-end, visually stunning executions of viral formats and dark humor. The premise can be slightly unhinged or ironic, but the visuals never break luxury. Think high-end perfume commercial meets TikTok audio trend. The Goddess is never the butt of the joke — she's the punchline, and she always wins.\n\r\n\n\r\n10% SENSORY / EXPERIMENTAL — Layered, fast, loop-optimized. Visual overload with mythological texture. The algorithmic wildcard.\n\r\n\n\r\nYES: Aspirational. Lethal elegance. Fashion-edit energy. Dark femininity. Music-driven impact. Content that feels like a luxury car reel meets ancient mythology. Cinematic skits using our AI personas — high-production value, deadpan, surreal, or darkly ironic.\n\r\n\n\r\nNO: CapCut presets. Generic motivational quote reels. Low-effort vlog-style acting. Slapstick comedy. Anything that looks like it was made in Canva. Anything that cheapens a demi-luxury product.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\n\n\r\nCreate & Adapt: Produce original Instagram/TikTok-native content using AI-generated visuals, trending audio, and our brand's mythology. Some pieces you'll build from scratch. Others you'll adapt from assets in our YouTube production pipeline. Either way, you're not resizing — you're crafting content shaped for how each platform rewards engagement.\n\r\n\n\r\nCinematic Skits: Build short-form skits around our AI personas that use trending formats, dark humor, or deadpan irony — executed at a visual level that never drops below luxury. People share it for the joke, follow the page for the aesthetic.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Persona Integration: Composite and stylize our AI-generated characters into edits as a visual anchor. She's not a narrator in your content — she's the presence. The face the eye locks onto while mythology and music layers move around her.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Content Generation: You won't just receive AI assets — you'll create them. Using tools like Seedance 2.0 and Seedream, you'll generate goddess visuals, atmospheric environments, and character footage that feed directly into your edits. You're both the director and the editor.\n\r\n\n\r\nMusic-Sync Editing: Your cuts, transitions, and visual reveals are married to the beat. You understand rhythm as a storytelling tool. Swells, drops, silence, impact — all intentional.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlatform Instinct: You understand what Instagram rewards vs. what TikTok rewards. You know what gets saved on IG. You know what gets looped on TikTok. You design for those behaviors, not just for visual quality.\n\r\n\n\r\nInstagram Packaging: Beyond the Reel itself — you contribute to grid cohesion, caption strategy, and Story sequencing. The profile should make someone think \"I want to be part of this\" within 2 seconds of landing.\n\r\n\n\r\nVolume at Speed: Once your templates and aesthetic are locked, your turnaround per piece should be significantly faster than building from zero. We expect high output.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nCORE REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter Effects (Strong Plus). Compositing, layering, motion graphics, light/shadow matching. If you have these skills, they'll set you apart. If you don't, strong AI generation skills and visual instinct can compensate.\n\r\n\n\r\nPremiere Pro. For project handoffs and consistency with the rest of the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Generation Fluency. This is not optional. You'll be using frontier AI tools daily — not just editing AI output, but generating it. You'll learn to prompt, iterate, select, and refine AI-generated visuals as a core part of your production workflow. We provide paid accounts for all tools (Seedance 2.0, Seedream, and whatever launches next). What we need is someone who treats these tools as creative instruments, not novelties.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Aesthetic Eye. You instinctively know the difference between aspirational and try-hard. Between elegant and overproduced. Between powerful and loud. Your edits make people feel something before they consciously understand what they're looking at.\n\r\n\n\r\nMusic & Rhythm. You've made edits where the music drives the visuals — AMVs, fashion reels, phonk edits, fan edits, whatever. You understand pacing as a weapon. You know what \"the drop\" means and you know when NOT to use it.\n\r\n\n\r\nLoop Thinking. You design edits that reward rewatching. The cut that lands on beat, the detail you only catch the second time, the seamless loop point. You think in circles, not lines.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong English. Daily async communication — clear, direct, professional.\n\r\n\n\r\nReliable & Coachable. You hit deadlines or warn early. You take direct feedback and iterate fast. You flag problems with options, not excuses.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nBONUS SKILLS (Not Required, But We'll Notice)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Color grading — pushing AI output and mixed footage into a consistent luxury palette\n\r\n- Typography sense — text overlays that feel intentional and premium\n\r\n- Sound design — SFX layering beyond just music (risers, hits, atmospheric texture)\n\r\n- Carousel / static design for Instagram companion posts\n\r\n- Understanding of Instagram analytics — saves, shares, completion rates, and what drives them\n\r\n- Experience building visual identities for brands or personas on social media\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWEEKLY OUTPUT\n\r\n\n\r\n3–5 pieces as you learn the brand aesthetic, lock your editing templates, learn the AI generation tools, and calibrate with the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nSteady state: 10–15 pieces per week across Instagram and TikTok — a mix of original productions and asset-based adaptations depending on the content calendar.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW THIS ROLE FITS\n\r\n\n\r\nOther editors handle cinematic YouTube production and visual effects — you own social media. Same mythology, same brand, different platform behavior. Each editor has a distinct lane, and yours is how Prismiera looks and feels on Instagram and TikTok.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nRAM: 16GB minimum (32GB preferred) + SSD\n\r\nReliable high-speed internet (upload speed matters)\n\r\nMust run video editing software and browser-based AI tools simultaneously\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nPAID TRIAL (Shortlisted Candidates)\n\r\n\n\r\nBefore any full-time commitment, we run a weekly paid trial. We provide real assets from our production pipeline, style references, and the AI persona visuals. You deliver content. Trial is compensated at $250 USD at the end of each week. If it's a mutual fit after 30 days, we transition to regular bi-weekly payments (before work).\n\r\n\n\r\nThis protects both sides — you see whether the work fits your strengths, we see whether the output fits our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\r\n\n\r\n- Paid accounts for all frontier AI tools — Seedance 2.0, Seedream, and whatever launches next\n\r\n- Creative ownership — you're defining how a luxury brand looks and feels on Instagram and TikTok from day one\n\r\n- An AI persona to build around — not a hypothetical, an active visual identity you'll shape and evolve\n\r\n- A role that evolves as the tools evolve — this job will look different in six months, and that's the point\n\r\n- Clear briefs — asset libraries, mood references, and specific direction for every batch\n\r\n- Direct feedback — specific, constructive notes on every edit\n\r\n- A brand worth building — Prismiera launches soon. A second AI-native brand is incubating behind it. You're not joining a finished machine. You're helping build one.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION\n\r\n\n\r\n$1,100 USD/month. Paid trial at $250 USD/week, transitioning to bi-weekly payments of $550 (before work) after 30 days.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nOWNERSHIP & CONFIDENTIALITY\n\r\n\n\r\nAll outputs (edits, project files, prompts, generated assets, persona visuals) are Prismiera property and must remain confidential.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a generic cover letter.\n\r\nUse 7 apply points or more when applying.\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: PRISMIERA SOCIAL — [Your Name]\n\r\n\n\r\nSend the following (in this order):\n\r\n\n\r\n1. The Vibe Test. Link to ONE edit you've made that is aspirational, aesthetic, or fashion-adjacent — or a skit that demonstrates platform-native virality instinct. Format doesn't matter. The feeling does.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. The Rhythm Test. Link to ONE edit where the music drives the visuals. Show us your beat-sync instinct. (Can overlap with #1 if one video demonstrates both.)\n\r\n\n\r\n3. The Creative Instinct Test (3–5 sentences total). You're given a 45-second cinematic video about a queen who poisoned her entire court, a folder of our AI Goddess visuals, and a dark atmospheric beat. Pitch two reworks: (A) a 15-second Instagram Reel designed to get saved — tell us your audio choice, pacing, and what the first 2 seconds look like; and (B) a 15-second cinematic skit that uses dark or deadpan humor without losing the luxury feel.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. AI Experience (1–2 sentences). What is your experience level with generative AI tools? If none, say so — we'll evaluate the rest on its own merits.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Hardware. Your PC specs: CPU / GPU / RAM. Plus your internet upload speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Turnaround Estimate. Given existing footage, a music track, and an established editing template — how long would a 15–20 second piece take you?\n\r\n\n\r\n7. The Rewrite. Rewrite this sentence to sound dark, powerful, and aspirational: \"She is really cool and strong and she wins.\"                ",

    "description": "\n                    Hi, I’m looking for someone to edit long-form videos. The editing will be very simple - I would even describe it more as clip sourcing rather than advanced editing.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe script will be in Polish. You will need to translate the script into English on your own, understand what each line means, and source around 4 B-roll clips per minute. For example, in a 20-minute video, that would be approximately 80 B-roll clips. You will also need to generate a voiceover according to my instructions.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere is a YouTube channel that creates exactly the type of content I’m referring to. The scripts will already be prepared by me.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a full-time position. I’m looking for a few dedicated people because I plan to scale these channels significantly.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe starting pay is $2 per edited minute (around $40 for a 20-minute video). If it turns out that the process is more time-consuming than expected, the rate can be increased - although I don’t anticipate it taking very long.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease apply only if you can fully commit. I’m looking to hire urgently.                ",

Your primary mission will be to ensure that every client file is complete, every data point is accurate, and our case management system reflects the current status of every matter. This is a remote, full-time position requiring extreme attention to detail and a \"measure twice, cut once\" mentality. Also - we are one big team looking for a long term hire to grow with us. You will be part of our team and we will meet with you regularly by zoom, with camera turned on because we want to maintain human connection with all tea\nmbers.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities:\n\r\n\n\r\nData Entry/Organization: Inputting sensitive client information into our case management software with accuracy. Names, addresses. You will make sure this information is entered in multiple places. You will review scanned documents and you will interpret from those documents where certain information should be entered.\n\r\n\n\r\nDigital File Architecture: Organizing and maintaining cloud-based client folders (e.g., Dropbox) according to our firm’s specific naming conventions and structure.\n\r\n\n\r\nWorkflow Tracking: Updating project milestones and deadlines to ensure no client file \"stalls\" during the drafting or funding process. We are doing all of the work - you will help us make sure the current status of the matter is always correctly documented.\n\r\n\n\r\nSOPs: You will create the SOPs for your own job. We will give you instructions and guidelines, but you will also create your own SOPs for how you approach the work.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Image Generation: You will help us format marketing materials, help us create AI educational images, etc. You will help us with Canva materials as well.\n\r\n\n\r\nLegacy Data Cleanup: Assisting with the migration or reorganization of older files into our current streamlined system.\n\r\n\n\r\nQualifications & Skills:\n\r\n\n\r\nLegal Experience: 2+ years as a legal assistant or paralegal (Estate Planning experience is a significant plus).\n\r\n\n\r\nSoftware Mastery: Proficiency with legal case management software (e.g., Clio, MyCase, or Smokeball) and secure cloud storage systems.\n\r\n\n\r\nData Integrity: A proven track record of handling high-volume data entry with zero-to-minimal error rates.\n\r\n\n\r\nTechnical Setup: Must have a secure, high-speed internet connection and a dedicated, quiet workspace that complies with client confidentiality (NDAs will be required).\n\r\n\n\r\nReliability: You are someone who values \"rugged\" reliability—you show up, do the work to a high standard, and don't require micro-management once a process is set.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease submit your resume and a brief cover letter. In your letter, please mention one specific tool or method you use to double-check your own work for data entry errors.                ",

Starting rate depends on experience and operational expertise).\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n???? About STX Promo & Our Growth:\n\r\n\n\r\nSTX Promo helps businesses and organizations Step Up Their Setup with eye-catching custom canopies, table covers, flags, banners, and more. We work with small businesses, schools, and nonprofits across the U.S. to elevate their brand presence at events and trade shows.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are growing incredibly fast. Over the last 10 months alone, we’ve added 4 people to our core team along with several specialized gig workers. As we gear up for our busiest season yet, our current Sales and Production Coordinator is handling a massive volume of orders. We are actively hiring a second full-time coordinator to jump into the trenches, split the workload, and help us maintain our pro-level communication and zero-hassle client experience.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n???? About the Role: Your Impact:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for a heavy hitter. We need a highly organized, proactive Sales & Production Coordinator who specializes in Client and Vendor Relations and Process Optimization.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn this role, you are the crucial bridge between our U.S. clients, our internal design team, and our manufacturing suppliers. Because we are growing so quickly, our backend operations need to evolve. We are looking for someone who brings strong operational insights to the table—someone who can look at how we currently do things, identify bottlenecks, and help us build more efficient, error-proof workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities:\n\r\n\n\r\nWorkflow Optimization: Actively analyze and improve our backend processes. Bring fresh ideas to the table on how to best utilize ClickUp, Shopify, and Gmail to maximize our team's efficiency and minimize costly mistakes.\n\r\n\n\r\nClient Relations: Manage daily incoming sales and customer service\ns (via Gmail) and handle live chat inquiries, utilizing AI tools (ChatGPT/Gemini) to draft efficient, professional responses.\n\r\n\n\r\nVendor Management: Place precise orders through various supplier portals. Proactively follow up on order statuses, track estimated delivery times, and troubleshoot any delays directly with vendors.\n\r\n\n\r\nProduction Coordination: Collaborate heavily with our Graphic Design team. You will confirm print graphics with clients, ensure mockups align with expectations, and prepare final files for supplier handoff.\n\r\n\n\r\nWorkflow Tracking: Organize and communicate project priorities using ClickUp to track progress and strict deadlines. Maintain organized client files within Google Drive.\n\r\n\n\r\nTeam Sync: Communicate efficiently with the internal team on a daily basis via WhatsApp.\n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule & Light Weekend Rotation: Work a consistent Monday–Friday U.S. daytime schedule. You won't have to work every weekend. You will split a light weekend inbox rotation with our current coordinator (e.g., alternating weekends or splitting Saturday/Sunday). This is just a quick check-in to ensure clients aren't left hanging. Many clients shop around on weekends—by replying quickly while our competitors wait until Monday, we win the deal!\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n? You're a Great Fit If You Have:\n\r\n\n\r\nTop-Tier English & US Culture Match: Proven experience working directly with a U.S.-based company. You must possess a strong understanding of American business communication, tone, and customer expectations. (This is a massive differentiator for us—your English must be impeccable).\n\r\n\n\r\nOperational Mindset: You aren't just an order-taker; you are a problem solver who naturally looks for ways to make systems run smoother and faster.\n\r\n\n\r\nVendor/Client Experience: A solid background in managing supplier relationships and keeping clients happy, especially when dealing with physical products and shipping deadlines.\n\r\n\n\r\nExtreme Attention to Detail: One wrong measurement or file upload can ruin a print job. You must be hyper-vigilant when approving graphics and placing orders.\n\r\n\n\r\nGrace Under Pressure: You thrive in a fast-paced environment, can juggle multiple priorities at once, and keep your cool during the \"busy season.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nReliability: A stable internet connection and a concrete backup plan for power or internet outages.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n? Bonus Points If You Also Have:\n\r\n\n\r\nPrior experience or understanding of the promotional products industry, large-format printing, or design files (e.g., bleed, CMYK, vectors).\n\r\n\n\r\nHands-on experience managing orders within Shopify.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n???? How to Apply (Please Read Carefully):\n\r\n\n\r\nAttention to detail starts here. To ensure your application stands out, please submit the following:\n\r\nYour updated Resume/CV.\n\r\n\n\r\nA short written note answering these three questions:\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat specific experience do you have managing US-based clients and interacting with third-party vendors/suppliers?\n\r\n\n\r\nHave you ever worked with print or design files before? If so, please briefly describe your experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy do you believe you would truly thrive in this fast-paced, high-volume role, and how do you approach making workflows more efficient?\n\r\n\n\r\n(Note: If your application is shortlisted, Step 2 of our interview process will be to submit a quick 2-minute video or voice intro so we can get to know you better!)\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications missing any of the requirements above will be automatically filtered out and will not be reviewed. We look forward to reviewing your application and finding the next crucial member of our growing team!                ",

To be considered,\n your CV to: \n with the following:\n\n\n\nProof of Experience: Provide a written referral or case study for 3 past employers or projects where you successfully grew a social presence or generated B2B leads.\n\n\n\nThe Comparison: Briefly explain the main difference in \"tone\" you would use when messaging a CEO in London vs. a Business Owner in Dubai.\n\n\n\nThe Infiltration: Identify two specific LinkedIn groups (one UK, one UAE) that would be high-value for an AI Automation agency to find clients.\n\n\n\nThe Bridge: A prospect in a group asks: \"I have too many leads and I can't keep up with the follow-up. Any advice?\" Write the 2-sentence comment you would post to get their attention without sounding like a salesman.                ",

If it's not in the script, don't say it. Park the conversation and flag it.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTIME-OFF POLICY\n\r\n\n\r\n- Planned time off requires a minimum of 21 days' notice\n\r\n- If unexpected circumstances prevent you from completing your shift, inform us as soon as possible so coverage can be arranged\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nStrength Physiotherapy — Helping serious lifters get back to training without fear of re-injury.

We are looking for a hungry, detail-oriented AI Content Creator and Community Manager who lives and breathes US basketball culture and can execute a strict, high-volume content formula.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo succeed in this role, you cannot just be a casual fan. You need a deep, almost encyclopedic knowledge of the NBA, historical matchups, player stats, and the current debate culture to create content that genuinely hooks a hardcore basketball audience and drives massive comment velocity.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Software You Will Use:\n\r\n\n\r\nNano Banana Pro: You will be provided access to generate images via our centralized Higgsfield Team Account so there is no cost to you. All text generation happens natively inside the prompt—no Photoshop or Canva required.\n\r\n\n\r\nSeedance 2.0 & Topaz: You will generate high-fidelity video motion using Seedance 2.0, and then use Topaz to upscale all final video assets to crisp 4K at 60fps. (Note: Access to these external tools will be provided. Once Seedance 2.0 is available on Higgsfield, we will transition that step into our Team plan).\n\r\n\n\r\nGoogle Drive & \n: \n is our HQ for all communication, concept pitches, and draft reviews (using a simple emoji approval system). Final high-resolution assets are strictly uploaded to our shared Google Drive.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Daily Responsibilities:\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Generation: Generate 5 AI images (Nano Banana Pro) and 6 short-form videos (Seedance 2.0 + Topaz upscaling) daily, strictly following our established text/image debate formulas and visual hooks.\n\r\n\n\r\nCopywriting: Write highly engaging captions, relevant hashtags, and debate-sparking questions for each post to drive community interaction.\n\r\n\n\r\nAsset Management: Upload all drafts to designated \n channels for quick review, then push final approved assets to Google Drive.\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunity Management: Act as a moderator for our page via Meta Business Suite. Reply to comments to boost algorithmic engagement, manage our official\n Group, and ensure our lead magnet links (wallpaper packs) are pinned in the comments as soon as posts go live.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Are Looking For:\n\r\n\n\r\nDeep, obsessive knowledge of the NBA, basketball history, and debate topics (e.g., MJ vs. LeBron, peak performances, rings vs. stats). You should be able to spot a flawed basketball argument from a mile away.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with AI image generation, video creation tools, and video upscaling software.\n\r\n\n\r\nReliability to hit the 11-post daily quota consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nExcellent written English for copywriting and community replies.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Perks:\n\r\n\n\r\nBase Pay: $400 - $500 USD per month ($100 - $125/week), paid weekly via Wise.\n\r\n\n\r\nPerformance Bonus: An end-of-month cash bonus if the page's overall Average View Duration hits our target metrics.\n\r\n\n\r\nBuffer Time: This is a full-time, 40-hour/week role. The content generation will leave you with healthy buffer time each day to handle moderation, research, and ideation without burning out.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\nPlease reply with the phrase \"Nothing but net\" at the top of your application so we know you read the entire post. Include a brief summary of why your favorite NBA team will (or won't) win the championship this year, and link to any previous AI, video editing, or community management work you have done.

You will be using my Peec.ai account to identify high-value search prompts and a widget and ai to implement the content updates.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\nData Analysis: Review visibility data in Peec.ai to identify and prioritize prompts with 4 and 5-bar frequency statuses and others that I may select, which are appropriate for my industry.\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Implementation: Take high-frequency search topics that are recommended and generate/edit professional, persuasive content to address them.  Most of the work here is done by ai.  Your job is to follow the instructions and create the content using the tools I provide.  Ultimately, you'll create the content in draft form, and I will do my final review and publish.  \n\r\n\n\r\nWebsite Updates: Accurately place content into my Squarespace website in draft format for me to review and publish.\n\r\n\n\r\nQuality Control: Ensure instructions are carried out exactly as specified, and communicate with me if there are any questions or concerns.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\n-- English fluency (written, reading, and spoken) is a strict requirement.\n\r\n-- Ability to follow detailed instructions accurately and without skipping steps.\n\r\n--Experience with GEO/ Ai SEO, and content management. \n\r\n--Experience with Squarespace websites.\n\r\n\n\r\nBonuses (if you have experience with any of these, that is more attractive to me):\n\r\n-- Familiarity with real estate terminology.\n\r\n-- Experience with writing, editing, and proofreading.\n\r\n-- Experience using AI tools (Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, etc) to refine and professionalize content.\n\r\n-- Experience with Peec or other similar tools to help with GEO/ Ai SEO, etc.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a long-term relationship.  Iniitally, there will be more hours required to get setup.  I would estimate 20-40 hours of work per week to get started for a week or two and then 5-20 hours per week to maintain.                ",

    "description": "\n                    ABOUT THIS PROJECT:\n\r\n\n\r\nI am looking for someone who is focused on innovation, trends, and the \"what's next\" in the design world. I am NOT looking for someone who creates designs for corporate brands or standard marketing materials that can't break that mold. Must be able to break the marketing mold and instead develop designs that communicate a feeling and are \"looks\" forward. Your portfolio MUST show this and your ability to develop cool projects not just corporate used assets. I'm an experienced Art Director and Graphic Designer based in the U.S. looking to build a standout portfolio that truly reflects the caliber of my work. The problem isn't the work — it's the time. I'm buried in client projects and need a talented, senior-level creative partner to take everything I've already designed and transform it into a polished, dynamic, and visually impressive portfolio website and project presentation system.\n\r\nThis is not a task-taking role. I want a true collaborator — someone who will absorb my vision, contribute their own creative ideas, push back when they have a better solution, and help elevate the final result beyond what either of us could do alone.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Website: \nv or Comparable Platform (This Is Critical)\n\r\nMy portfolio site is currently being built on \nv, an AI-powered web design platform, and this piece of the project is just as important as the design work itself. Here's why this matters so much: once the project is complete, I need to be able to manage, edit, and add to the site myself — without hiring a developer every time I want to swap out a project or update a section. \nv makes this possible through its AI chat-based editing interface, which lets non-developers make real changes without touching code. If you are experienced with \nv, you move to the top of the list immediately.\n\r\nThat said, I am open to other platforms — but only if they meet the same criteria:\n\r\n- The site must be a real, live, published website (not a mockup or template PDF)\n\r\n- I must be able to edit and add to it myself after handoff without needing to rehire\n\r\n- It should support a visually rich, modern, and dynamic design — not a cookie-cutter template look\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're proposing an alternative to \nv, tell me specifically what platform you'd use, why it's better for this project, and how it gives me the same self-service editing capability. I'm open to the conversation — just come with a clear recommendation and reasoning.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Taking my existing design files (print, social, logo/branding, vector assets, etc.) across multiple campaigns and brands and building cohesive, story-driven project presentations\n\r\n- Placing designs onto high-quality 4K photorealistic mockups so the work comes to life beyond flat files\n\r\n- Crafting visual storyboards and case study layouts that communicate the creative strategy and execution behind each project\n\r\n- Building and publishing the actual portfolio website on \nv or an agreed-upon alternative that meets the self-editing requirement\n\r\n- Incorporating motion graphics or subtle animations to make the portfolio feel modern and dynamic (AI-assisted motion is acceptable)\n\r\n- Maintaining a strong understanding of American design culture and what resonates with U.S.-based hiring teams and creative directors\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Senior-level graphic design experience — strong eye and deep experience across branding, print, and digital\n\r\n- Mockup & presentation design — expert-level ability to composite designs onto 4K realistic mockups and build compelling case study layouts\n\r\n- Web design AND development — you need to build a real, live, published site, not just design it in Figma and call it done\n\r\n- \nv experience — strongly preferred; if you have it, lead with it\n\r\n- Motion graphics / animation — at minimum, comfortable using AI tools to add movement and life to portfolio pieces\n\r\n- AI design tools — proficient with AI-powered design workflows (Higgsfield, Nano Banana Pro, Firefly, or similar)\n\r\n- Strong grasp of American aesthetics and design culture — this portfolio targets U.S. companies and hiring directors, so your sensibility needs to reflect that\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT I AM NOT LOOKING FOR:\n\r\n\n\r\nA \"yes person.\" I don't want someone who just executes instructions. I want someone who reviews my inspiration, understands the goal, and brings their own strong creative perspective to the table. If you have a better idea, say so.\n\r\n\n\r\nPROJECT TIMELINE AND COMMUNICATION:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Target completion: 4–8 weeks depending on scope and workflow speed\n\r\n- Weekly check-ins via video call or messaging to review progress and align on direction\n\r\n- Responsive communication is required — I need to know things are moving                ",
