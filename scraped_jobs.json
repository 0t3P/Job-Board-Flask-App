You will be communicating directly with travelers, guiding them through options, answering questions, and helping move trips from inquiry to confirmed booking.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is best suited for someone who already understands the pace, terminology, and expectations of the travel industry and can step in with minimal training while contributing confidently from the start.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\nResponsibilities include responding to new travel inquiries and gathering intake details. You will assist with planning vacation rentals, villas, cruises, and traditional travel experiences. This includes researching destinations, accommodations, and experiences using supplier networks and destination management company resources.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will build and format quotes and itineraries, communicate recommendations clearly to clients, and track traveler preferences, budgets, and trip requirements.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe role also includes coordinating with global suppliers such as hotels, villa partners, cruise lines, and DMCs to confirm availability, rates, amenities, and booking terms. You will manage follow-ups, holds, and supplier communications while ensuring all details are documented accurately.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdministrative responsibilities include maintaining CRM records, tracking trip stages and payments, organizing contracts and confirmations, managing inbox communications, supporting workflow checklists, and assisting with calendar coordination and scheduling.\n\r\n\n\r\nSales and Client Engagement Component\n\r\nWhile this is not a high-pressure sales role, it does require comfort with consultative selling and client-facing communication.\n\r\nWe do not engage in cold sales or outbound prospecting. All client interactions are inquiry-based, meaning you will be responding to travelers who have already expressed interest in planning a trip.\n\r\nYou will communicate directly with clients via\n and occasionally phone or video, guide travelers through options, answer questions, address hesitations, and help move inquiries toward booking decisions. You should feel comfortable discussing pricing, value, and travel experiences while supporting quote revisions and follow-ups.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe ideal candidate is comfortable picking up the reins in client conversations and helping bring trips to confirmation through trust, knowledge, and responsiveness.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Experience\n\r\nCandidates must have four to five years or more experience in the travel industry.

A background in customer service and client-facing communication is essential, along with administrative or operational support experience and strong written communication skills.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not an entry-level role. Candidates must have prior travel industry experience(3+ years) and the ability to operate independently within established workflows. We are looking for someone who can step in and contribute without requiring extensive foundational training.\n\r\n\n\r\nIdeal backgrounds include prior work within a travel agency, tour operator, villa or vacation rental company, luxury travel planning environment, destination management company, or cruise or hospitality booking organization.\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunication Requirements\n\r\nCandidates must be fluent in spoken and written English and comfortable speaking directly with clients. Communication should feel polished, professional, and aligned with a luxury service environment. Strong clarity in written\ns and itinerary presentations is required.\n\r\n\n\r\nIdeal Candidate Traits\n\r\nThe ideal candidate is highly detail-oriented, organized, and process-driven. You should be comfortable managing multiple trips simultaneously and confident in client-facing conversations. Strong problem-solving ability, follow-through, and accountability are essential, along with comfort working remotely and independently.\n\r\nPreferred but Not Required\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience working with luxury or high-net-worth clients is a plus. Familiarity with curated or bespoke travel planning is valuable. Marketing exposure, lead generation experience, Canva or itinerary design skills, and CRM or project management system experience are also beneficial but not required.\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Structure\n\r\nThis is a remote position. Daytime availability aligned with EST is preferred. The role may be structured as part-time or full-time depending on experience and fit, with long-term opportunity for the right candidate.must have complete setup to work remotely--computer, wifi,backup generator etc                ",

Through our online platform, The Lightup Hub, we support students with high-quality videos, structured notes, quizzes, and personalised revision plans that actually work.\n\r\nWe’ve already supported over 150,000 students and we’re growing fast. Everything we publish matters because it directly impacts how students learn and how confident they feel walking into exams.\n\r\nBehind every great lesson is excellent execution. That’s where you come in.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Mission\n\r\n\n\r\nWe believe education should feel empowering, not overwhelming. Too many students struggle because content is poorly organised, rushed, or unclear. We’re building a platform where quality, clarity, and consistency come first, so students always know they’re learning from something they can trust.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role \n\r\n\n\r\nThis role owns content delivery end-to-end. You’ll be responsible for making sure every piece of content goes from idea to live on the platform smoothly, on time, and to a very high standard.\n\r\nYou’ll sit at the centre of multiple moving parts. Working closely with the CEO, product, editors, and external contributors, you’ll organise timelines, manage deadlines, format resources, upload content into the Lightup backend, and quality-check everything before it goes live.\n\r\nIf you love organisation, precision, and making complex workflows run like clockwork, this role is for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Do\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Operations & Delivery:\n\r\n1. Own the full lifecycle of content from planning through to publication\n\r\n2. Manage timelines and deadlines across videos, quizzes, PDFs, and revision resources\n\r\n3. Coordinate filming schedules and content creation with the CEO and contributors\n\r\n4. Liaise with external creators when needed to ensure content is delivered on time\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Formatting & Uploading:\n\r\n1. Format learning resources including PowerPoints and PDFs to match Lightup standards\n\r\n2. Upload videos, quizzes, and written content into the Lightup backend\n\r\n3. Ensure all content follows the correct structure and naming conventions\n\r\n\n\r\nQuality Assurance\n\r\n1. Proofread all content for spelling, grammar, clarity, and accuracy\n\r\n2. Check that GCSE English terminology and explanations are precise and correct\n\r\n3. QA content post-upload to ensure everything works properly and displays correctly\n\r\n4. Spot errors before students ever see them\n\r\n\n\r\nOrganisation & Ownership\n\r\n1. Create and maintain clear content trackers and delivery schedules\n\r\n2. Proactively identify risks, bottlenecks, or missing pieces and resolve them early\n\r\n3. Orchestrate multiple contributors while keeping standards high\n\r\n4. Take full ownership of content delivery without needing close supervision\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We’re Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have:\n\r\n1. Experience in content management, or production management\n\r\n2. Strong experience coordinating and leading projects with multiple stakeholders\n\r\n3. Exceptional written English and proofreading ability\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to have:\n\r\n1. Experience in education or edtech\n\r\n2. Experience working with learning platforms or CMS systems\n\r\n3. Previous operation business administration \n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are:\n\r\n1. Highly organised and process-driven\n\r\n2. Extremely detail-oriented with a low tolerance for errors\n\r\n3. Confident managing deadlines and holding others accountable\n\r\n4. Comfortable working autonomously with high responsibility\n\r\n5. Calm, reliable, and precise under pressure\n\r\n6. Passionate about producing high-quality educational content\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role Matters:\n\r\nThis role is critical to Lightup’s success. You’re not just “uploading content”. You’re protecting quality, consistency, and trust. Students rely on what we publish, and you’ll be the person ensuring everything meets the standard they deserve.\n\r\nIf you love making systems work, enjoy ownership, and take pride in flawless execution, you’ll thrive here.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication: If you are interested in this role, please reach out and we will send you an internal application link for you to complete for consideration by our panel.

There are unreconciled general entries, missing journal entries, credit card transactions that were never properly categorized or reconciled, and intercompany activity that has not been consistently tracked. Our processes for credit card management, coding, and reconciliation need to be completely overhauled.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not looking for someone to walk into a tidy operation and maintain it. We need someone who can walk into a mess, take charge, clean it up, build the right processes, and then run the operation going forward. You will also serve as a trusted advisor to the CEO and COO on financial controls, helping design and implement the control framework across all entities.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf cleaning up broken books and building something from the ground up excites you, this is your role. If you prefer inheriting a well-organized system, this is not the right fit.\n\r\nThe Role: Two Phases\n\r\nPhase 1: Cleanup and Stabilization (Months 1–6)\n\r\nThis is the critical foundation. Your first six months will be focused on getting the books right and building the processes that prevent future problems.\n\r\n\n\r\nHistorical Cleanup\n\r\nReconcile and correct all general ledger entries dating back to October 2023 across all entities\n\r\nIdentify and post missing journal entries (revenue recognition, accruals, intercompany charges, expense allocations)\n\r\nClean up and reconcile approximately 80 accounts (property operating accounts, corporate accounts, trust accounts)\n\r\nResolve all mystery intercompany balances and establish proper tracking going forward\n\r\nPrepare clean, supportable schedules for our outside CPA firm\n\r\n\n\r\nCredit Card Process Overhaul\n\r\nAudit all credit card transactions from October 2023 to present\n\r\nRecategorize, code, and reconcile historical credit card activity\n\r\nDesign and implement a new credit card management process including coding standards, approval workflows, monthly reconciliation procedures, and cardholder accountability\n\r\nDocument the new process and train the bookkeeper on execution\n\r\n\n\r\nControls and Process Framework\n\r\nAdvise the CEO and COO on what financial controls are needed and where gaps exist\n\r\nDesign and implement controls that apply retroactively to October 2023 where possible and going forward permanently\n\r\nBuild a documented month-end close checklist with clear ownership and deadlines\n\r\nCreate standardized procedures for intercompany workflows, account reconciliation, AP approval, and journal entry documentation\n\r\nEstablish coding standards across all entities for consistency\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 2: Controller Operations (Month 7 and Ongoing)\n\r\nOnce the foundation is solid, you will own and run the full accounting operation across all entities.\n\r\n\n\r\nMonth-End Close and Reporting\n\r\nLead month-end close across all entities (journal entries, accruals, reconciliations, balance sheet support)\n\r\nDrive the company to a Day 5 close and maintain that standard\n\r\nProduce monthly owner statements for each property, ensuring accuracy and timely delivery\n\r\nMaintain accurate entity and property-level financials\n\r\nInterface with outside CPA firm for tax preparation, providing clean schedules and documentation\n\r\n\n\r\nProperty Accounting and CAM/Recoveries\n\r\nHandle property-level accounting across 40+ commercial and residential properties in a portfolio environment\n\r\nManage CAM reconciliations and recoveries (currently needed on approximately 4 properties)\n\r\nEnsure reporting aligns with lease requirements and property management agreements\n\r\n\n\r\nAP/AR Oversight, Payroll, and 1099s\n\r\nOversee AP entry and processing through your direct report (bookkeeper), ensuring proper coding and timely payment\n\r\nEnsure AR accuracy and follow-through (largely automated but requires oversight)\n\r\nOversee payroll workflow using Gusto, ensuring proper coding and clean payroll-related reconciliations\n\r\nOwn 1099 preparation coordination and accuracy for all vendors and contractors\n\r\n\n\r\nBrokerage Support and Financial Analysis\n\r\nSupport brokers with deal-related financial analysis including lease vs. buy comparisons, stay vs. go analyses, and scenario modeling\n\r\nAdapt existing Excel templates, validate assumptions, and produce clean client-facing outputs\n\r\nHelp leadership and brokers understand deal economics quickly\n\r\n\n\r\nOngoing Systems and Process Improvement\n\r\nOperate in AppFolio (or comparable PM system) and QuickBooks Online (or comparable GL)\n\r\nContinuously improve processes, reduce rework, and strengthen controls\n\r\nIdentify and flag issues proactively rather than waiting to be asked\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\r\nBy Month 1\n\r\nFull diagnostic of the books is complete with a prioritized cleanup plan shared with CEO/COO\n\r\nCredit card audit is underway and new process design is drafted\n\r\nInitial controls recommendations have been presented to leadership\n\r\nBookkeeper workflow is assessed and initial improvements are in motion\n\r\n\n\r\nBy Month 6\n\r\nAll historical entries back to October 2023 are reconciled and corrected\n\r\nCredit card process is fully overhauled, documented, and operating\n\r\nIntercompany activity is cleaned up with no mystery balances\n\r\nMonth-end close is reliably completed by Day 5\n\r\nOwner statements go out clean and on time\n\r\nControls framework is documented and in practice (close checklist, approval flows, coding standards)\n\r\nAP workflow runs smoothly through the bookkeeper with proper oversight\n\r\n\n\r\nOngoing\n\r\nBooks remain clean with no backlog accumulation\n\r\nProcesses are followed consistently and improved iteratively\n\r\nLeadership has reliable, timely financial information for decision-making\n\r\nBrokerage team receives responsive and accurate financial analysis
