This is an expert led, credibility?driven brand, not a trend chasing influencer account. I’d like someone who can execute now and grow with the brand. I also work on medical education and curriculum projects, and there will be some light admin support related to those over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll do\n\r\n1. Content & creative: \n\r\nTurn long form posts into:\n\r\n- 2–3 short form video scripts (Reels/TikTok)\n\r\n- 1–2 carousel posts\n\r\n- Adapt tone for Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn\n\r\n- Keep voice and visuals consistent\n\r\n\n\r\n2.

Light admin\n\r\n- Format and schedule Substack posts, substack notes and LinkedIn (content provided)\n\r\n- Maintain a simple content calendar and idea list\n\r\n- Support administrative tasks for curriculum projects (organizing documents, basic research, slide or resource formatting)\n\r\n\n\r\nTools\n\r\nNice if you know some of these; you must be willing to learn: CapCut, Canva, Notion, Google Workspace, Slack, AI assistants, a password manager. Interest in learning new tools is a plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is for you if: \n\r\n- You’ve managed or grown personal brands before\n\r\n- You understand short form content strategy and basic analytics\n\r\n- You’re excited about testing ideas and taking responsibility for growth, not just posting\n\r\n- You can turn thoughtful writing into engaging short content\n\r\n- You’re organized, reliable, and communicate clearly\n\r\n- You take initiative but respect and protect the brand voice\n\r\n\n\r\nNot a fit if: \n\r\nYou only schedule posts, need constant supervision, copy trends without thinking about positioning, or lean on AI without judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & growth\n\r\n- USD $6–8/hour to start (depending on experience and portfolio)\n\r\n- Trial phase: ~5 hours/week for the first month to test fit and workflows\n\r\n- After trial: increase to ~10 hours/week, with potential to grow toward 15–20 hours/week\n\r\n- Performance based bonuses and rate increases for reliability, initiative, and results\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply\n\r\nPlease include:\n\r\n- A short intro (in your own voice) and why this role interests you.\n\r\n- Links to 2–3 accounts you’ve managed + what you did for each.\n\r\n- Task: One example of turning a 1,000?word article into: \n\r\n1. One Reel idea (hook + 3–4 points)\n\r\n2. One carousel outline (title + slide bullets)\n\r\n- Your hourly rate and weekly availability (PH time).\n\r\n- Optional but helpful: 1–2 ideas for growth or branding experiments you’d try in the first 60 days for an AI?in?healthcare personal brand\n\r\n- Start your application with the word STRATEGY.

    "description": "\n                    Please read the ENTIRE description before applying! :)\n\r\n\n\r\nOur previous candidate couldn't continue due to personal problems so we're now ONLY looking for VERY dedicated members with experience in CapCut and other AI tools mentioned. This opportunity is seriously much better than it sounds at first glance!\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nA few words about us:\n\r\n\n\r\nHey! We are Organic Media, a micro-agency creating and distributing educational and engaging AI-generated short-form videos for e-commerce brands, mainly in the pet niche.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll work directly with our amazing manager ( 20 years old from Europe, with over 3 years of real experience in this exact space ), who has personally prepared step-by-step tutorials on Loom to teach you everything from the ground up.\n\r\nNo confusion. No guessing. No wasted time. ( Most tea\nmbers learned the workflow within a few days and are now working fully independently )\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat kind of videos will you create?\n\r\nSimple UGC-like short-form videos fully based on the provided scripts by us ( you might just need to tweak a few words if needed ) which look realistic and feel \"natural\" to the viewers on platforms like YouTube Shorts, Instagram or\n. Some of them are silently advertising products at the end but the key is that it doesn't sound like an ad but rather a native short-form video which a real person/influencer would record with their iPhone. There are a few styles such as just a calm \"sit down\" video ( where there's only one image and the influencer would just talk for 2 minutes ) or other ones where there're a few \"shots\" of them with a few seconds each and the scenes change but it's really not difficult at all - just a few more generations and then connecting them in CapCut.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe process is straightforward:\n\r\nGetting our scripts ready and approved, using your own creativity and generating high quality base images using tools like Nano Banana Pro, turning these images into video clips using platforms like Veo3, Kling or HeyGen and for voice ElevenLabs, cuts and trimming, other minor adjustments such as background audio effects if needed ( like supermarket background audio ). Whole process is 90% just creating the right images/video clips etc, we might not even do transitions or captions so there won't be much editing skill needed. Everything is shown clearly in the training.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be creating a lot of videos a day but these are not complex edits AT ALL. Difficulty level: 6/10 ( again, 80% is just generating the rate \"input\" images and later just animating them with voice. That's it )\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHere are visual examples of what the videos look like ( NOT OURS ):\n\r\n1. \n/reel/DTty7hsAHe_/\n\r\n2. \n/reel/DT0R9KgDkuW/\n\r\n3. \n/reel/DSc75hsDQV6/\n\r\n4. \n/reel/DT8pDFngXfp/\n\r\n5. \n/reel/DUOAHm3kY7P/\n\r\n\n\r\n( In your application, let us know your thoughts, do you think you can easily recreate them - what tools would you use and why? )\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTraining & onboarding ( this is the biggest advantage )\n\r\nOnce hired, you will receive structured video tutorials. In total, we have a few hours available, though most people don’t need all of it. The workflow is clear so no missing steps and no “figure it out yourself.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nDaily workload ( important )\n\r\nYou’ll create around 10 to 20+ videos per day ( 1 to 2 min long - we’ll start with a smaller amount and later increase it - won't negatively affect your monthly pay. We just want to make it easier for you to start - ultimately we'll be doing 20+ but making sure it's under 8-10h a day, at first it may take you longer and we may work harder - but once learned it easily becomes manageable ).\n\r\nIn reality, you'd have exactly 4 unique \"AI influencers\" but all of 4 them have the same scripts to use, you'd just need to change a few words to help with the context ( some of them might be talking only about \"dogs\" but some about \"cats\" so just need to change a few words to make it all make sense ) and you could use the same image prompts to generate almost identical images for each influencer. In reality it’s just 2 to 6 original videos PER INFLUENCER ( 4 of them ) and each with a very similar structure. Once trained, this is very manageable.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour job is simple:\n\r\nCreate the videos, export them, and send them to us daily on \n.\n\r\nThat’s it. No posting. No account management. No stress.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nEquipment & storage ( we make this easy )\n\r\nYou’ll need a good computer that can smoothly handle 1080p/light 4k video editing ( we’ll do 1080p but we’re going to work on multiple browser tabs ), a stable internet connection, and at least 16GB of RAM and 250GB+ of fast storage AVAILABLE. 1TB+ of SSD storage is preferred ( make sure it’s SSD and not old and slow HDD ).\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you need to buy storage/RAM ( for example, a 1TB SSD for around $100 ), we will refund you. This is required ONLY to save you time and speed up your workflow so you can be more efficient since it can be a couple GB of files a day ( you can later remove them after sending them to us. )\n\r\n\n\r\nThere also may be small subscription costs which you’d have to cover later if needed ( only around $10 a month ) for services like iCloud+ on iPhone/iPad or \n Nitro - we refund those as well.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTools & software ( HUGE upside )\n\r\nYou get FREE access to ALL paid tools that cost us hundreds of dollars per month, including:\n\r\n- AI avatar tools like HeyGen or Veo3,\n\r\n- Copywriting software like ChatGPT+, Grok or Claude,\n\r\n- Editing software like CapCut PRO on Desktop,\n\r\n- and our CUSTOM voice-over tools like ElevenLabs,\n\r\nWe provide logins, instructions, and full support.\n\r\n( ALL OF THEM ARE WORTH $500+ MONTHLY )\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWork environment & communication\n\r\nYou’ll have a private 1:1 chat with our manager and separate one to send your daily work in, work fully remotely through \n, receive clear feedback, and be treated as a long-term tea\nmber, not disposable labor.\n\r\nNo stressful interviews. No micromanagement. No slow\ns back and forth.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nResponsibilities\n\r\n- Adjust our scripts for the context\n\r\n- Create videos from start to finish.\n\r\n- Export and send them.\n\r\n- Apply feedback and improve.\n\r\n- Prepare scripts for the next day.\n\r\n- Organize files properly.\n\r\n- Communicate clearly.\n\r\n- Hit deadlines without reminders.\n\r\nThat’s it. Simple, repetitive, and enjoyable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis job is perfect for you if\n\r\nYou’re looking for long-term stability ( months or years ), you’re willing to learn, tech-savvy, creative, organized, and able to focus consistently. You already have video creation/editing experience. Already done some AI influencers related jobs and have good experience in: Google VEO3, Nano Banana Pro, HeyGen, ElevenLabs, CapCut PRO and other similar tools. Your computer can handle multiple tabs open ( A LOT of them ). You care about doing things properly, understand and speak English well, respond to messages quickly, and can work up to 6 days per week. You’re a young, talented, smart individual. You’re okay with a slightly heavier learning phase in the first week, you’re not afraid to ask questions, you’re reliable and honest about mistakes, and you either already have or can get an iPhone device ( used only for specific verification codes - refunded if needed. You can even get some used iPhone 8 for like $40 which works ).\n\r\nWe value dedication, reliability, and improvement more than raw talent.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis job is not for you if\n\r\nYou’re looking for quick money, disappear without communication, can’t focus, you’re on the older side and have never edited 1 video in your life, never played with the AI tools mentioned above, your computer can’t handle having multiple tabs open at the same time, have unstable internet, refuse feedback, rush work carelessly, avoid consistency, or cannot communicate in English.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSalary & payments\n\r\nThis is a full-time position, starting at 6 days per week, under 10 hours per day. ( ultimately under 8h once you become very efficient, which our manager will help you achieve and it won't impact your salary working less - quite the opposite! )\n\r\n\n\r\nStarting salary ranges from around $440-$540/month based on experience, with the potential in the future to increase to $540+ based on a few factors such as performance, dedication, and quality of work.\n\r\n\n\r\nPayments are monthly, in any currency or method available in your country. ( we’ll try )\n\r\n\n\r\nTo build trust, we’re offering to pay you $100 after the first week of working with us, with the remaining balance at month end. ( we already got scammed by other platforms so please respect this )\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd remember, we pay $500+ dollars/month for paid tools so you can get them for FREE meaning your pay is actually 100% profit + refunds for any costs of yours. ( meaning in theory your total compensation is closer to $1000+ including tool access )\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHiring process (step-by-step)\n\r\n- Please re-read this job post carefully and only then submit your application.\n\r\n- In your job application, make sure to set the right title and answer every point.\n\r\n- We will review it and reach out with an extra message if accepted.\n\r\n- We'll send you a Google Form to fill out with contact info, etc.\n\r\n- You’ll be invited to our \n server and will get your 1:1 chat.\n\r\n- You'll complete the training and take notes of it to learn everything.\n\r\n- We'll give you access to all the tools and refund any required purchases.\n\r\n- You'll officially start creating videos for Organic Media and get hired.\n\r\nSimple and effective.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy this is a real opportunity\n\r\nNo confusion, no guessing, no unpaid trials. You get real structured video training on Loom, real tools, real support, and real long-term growth - including potential promotion to coach or lead roles.\n\r\nSome jobs may offer to pay more, but very few:\n\r\nTeach you properly step by step, invest in you, respect your time, and give you paid tools for free.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply (pay attention)\n\r\nYour application title must start with the first word “ Influencer ”:\n\r\n“ Influencer: (…) “\n\r\nApplications without this will be ignored.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application, please include the following:\n\r\n- Your detailed thoughts on the 5 videos linked above,\n\r\n- Your past experience ( or none - that’s fine ),\n\r\n- Links to any past work or simple edits,\n\r\n- a detailed introduction about yourself,\n\r\n- Your daily routine and availability,\n\r\n- Why you want this opportunity and why we should pick you over someone else. ( why you’re special )\n\r\n- and detailed answers to these 15 questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Do you have experience using CapCut on DESKTOP? How long have you been using it, and what type of videos do you usually create with it?\n\r\n2. Which AI video tools have you personally used? ( For example: VEO, Kling, Nano Banana Pro, Seedream 4,5, HeyGen, Vozo, etc.) Briefly describe what you used them for.\n\r\n3. When you watch short-form videos that reuse existing footage, are you able to recognize patterns such as hooks, pacing, avatar placement, and caption timing? Please explain how you notice these patterns.\n\r\n4. We work with very detailed step-by-step SOPs that specify exactly which clips to use and how to assemble them. How do you typically work when instructions are extremely clear and structured?\n\r\n5. If you are unsure about a task or something does not match the instructions, what do you do?\n\r\n6. When generating AI videos, what are the most common problems you run into? (for example: bad lip sync, weird hands, low realism, wrong lighting, artifacts, etc.)\n\r\n7. Would you say you’re more of a creative problem-solver who looks for shortcuts, loopholes, or ways around limitations, or someone who prefers to strictly follow rules and structure?\n\r\n8. Have you ever had to regenerate the same AI scene or just an image multiple times to get a usable result? What usually goes wrong and how do you fix it?\n\r\n9. When working with AI tools, do you prefer experimenting freely or strictly following a proven workflow? Why?\n\r\n10. Tell us about your PC specs, how much RAM and Available Storage and is it a PC or laptop/Macbook. Also, do you already have an iPhone/iPad? If so, which model is it/generation?\n\r\n11. Are you good at learning? Meaning if you want to learn something by for example, watching YouTube tutorials - do you usually rewatch it or take notes? Or just watch it once and try it yourself?\n\r\n12. Describe exactly how you usually organize your project files when working on multiple videos at the same time.\n\r\nFor example: how you name folders, how you separate drafts vs finals, and how you avoid losing assets.\n\r\n13. Take a look at the job post once again and find the 5 video example links we've included above. Watch all of them fully and let us know your overall thoughts, how do you think they were created - what tools would you use and why? Please cover the whole process in detail ( these aren't our videos but very similar )\n\r\n14. What are your long-term plans or goals with this opportunity?\n\r\n15. To confirm that you’ve read everything carefully, please tell us your favorite meal and dessert, as well as a restaurant in your country. Explain why someone from outside your country should absolutely try it. :)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not use ChatGPT or any AI to fully write your application. Be real, honest and detailed. We value spelling mistakes over perfect, AI generated responses. ( Yes, we can detect AI generated responses and it just isn't a good look on you )\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must also follow our Instagram: ( \n/organicxmedia )\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nFinal note\n\r\nWe are hiring ONLY 1 PERSON for this role and are focused strictly on long-term relationships ( months + )\n\r\nIf you are dedicated, reliable, and willing to learn, this can be a very comfortable long-term position. Can’t wait to have you on - good luck!                ",

The editing energy leans closer to a perfectly-timed After Effects edit / storytelling than a corporate product video. (You have an eye for aesthetics and cinematography)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will receive a script, a voiceover file, and a mood reference. Your job is to build the scene from nothing: generate AI visuals, voiceovers, source archival footage, layer sound design, and deliver a short where every second earns the next. A visual storyteller. (We provide access to the frontier generation models)\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Style\n\r\n\n\r\nYES: Dark luxury. Museum. AE VFX edit. Stylish/Lethal. Fun. Rich textures. Clean typography. Controlled palette. Both silence and impact used with intention.\n\r\n\n\r\nNO: CapCut default presets. Anything that looks like a stock photo slideshow or a corporate deck.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand that more effects does not necessarily mean better. Every cut has a reason.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Skills (Non-Negotiables)\n\r\n\n\r\nMotion Graphics - You can build scenes, transitions, and visual elements from scratch in After Effects - not just cut footage.\n\r\n\n\r\nVoiceover-First Storytelling - You are editing to a narration primarily, music track second. You know when to let a line breathe and when to accelerate. You never bury the script's punchline under a flashy transition. The voice leads - the visuals serve.\n\r\n\n\r\nRetention Instinct - You understand that the first frame is an ad for the second frame. You know what stops a scroll. You build hooks visually, not just with text overlays. Every 2–3 seconds, something changes.\n\r\n\n\r\nRhythm & Beat-Sync - You can sync cuts, zooms, and effects to music. You understand \"the drop.\" If you've made AMVs, fan/anime edits, or phonk edits, you already have this skill - we want you to apply it with restraint.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI-Assisted Asset Creation - You are comfortable generating images and short clips using tools like Midjourney or Kling. (We usually move onto new tools as soon as they are released). You treat AI as a production tool, not a novelty. We provide all paid accounts - you bring the creative judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Skills (Not Required, But We'll Notice)\n\r\n\n\r\n- After Effects compositing - Mocha tracking, light matching (future projects will involve product placement in video scenes)\n\r\n- Typography sense - fonts that feel intentional, never default\n\r\n- Color grading - pushing AI output and footage into a consistent palette\n\r\n- Sound design beyond music - layering SFX on movement, crafting risers and hits\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWeekly Output\n\r\n\n\r\nRamp-up (first 2–3 weeks): 2–3 shorts as you learn the brand voice and pipeline.\n\r\nSteady state: 4–5 shorts per week at the locked quality standard.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work from clear creative briefs with reference scripts, mood boards, and audio clips for most batches.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a generic cover letter.\n\r\nUse 7 apply points or more when applying.\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: Lethal Editor - [Your name]\n\r\n\n\r\nSend the following (in this order):\n\r\n\n\r\n1. The Story Test. Link to ONE short-form video you edited that includes voiceover or spoken dialogue. We need to see that you can pace visuals to a script.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. The AE Style Test. Link to ONE video that shows your visual rhythm and editing craft - an AMV, fan edit, fashion reel, or anything where the editing itself is the skill. It doesn't need to be \"dark\" or \"luxury.\" It needs to show us how you think about pacing and impact.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. AI Experience (1 sentence). What is your experience level with generative AI tools (Midjourney, seedream, Kling, etc.)? If none, say so - we'll evaluate the rest of your application on its own merits.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Hardware. Your PC specs: CPU / GPU / RAM. Plus your internet upload speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Turnaround Estimate. How long does a 30–50 second high-quality short typically take you, start to finish?\n\r\n\n\r\n6. The Rewrite. Rewrite this sentence to sound dark, powerful, and modern: \"She is really cool and strong and she wins.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nPaid Trial (Shortlisted Candidates)\n\r\n\n\r\nBefore any full-time commitment, we run a weekly paid trial. We provide real scripts and style references. You deliver 30–50 second shorts. Trial is compensated at $250 USD at the end of each week (after work). If it's a mutual fit after 30 days, we transition to $550 USD payments every 2 weeks (before work).\n\r\n\n\r\nThis protects both of us - you see whether the work fits your strengths, we see whether the output fits our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n- Paid accounts for all frontier AI tools; seedance2.0, seedream5.0, etc.\n\r\n- Creative identity - you're building the visual identity of a brand from launch, not filling someone else's template\n\r\n- Clear briefs - most, if not every batch comes with scripts, audio files, mood boards, and specific reference videos\n\r\n- Direct feedback - specific, constructive notes on every edit.\n\r\n- A brand worth building - Prismiera launches April 2026. A second AI native game/anime brand after that. You're not joining a machine. You're helping build one.                ",

You’ll take raw footage and turn it into polished, high-performing content across YouTube, Instagram, podcast, and ads - consistently, on time, and at a standard that makes people stop scrolling.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a “chop up some clips” role. You’ll be editing long-form YouTube videos, short-form social content, full podcast episodes with video, and ad creatives - all for a brand that’s growing fast and needs someone who can keep up. You’ll work closely with our Creative Content Manager and directly contribute to content that reaches thousands of creative business owners every week.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Actually Do:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. YouTube Long-Form Editing\n\r\n- Edit 1–2 long-form YouTube videos per week (8–20 minutes) from raw footage to final export\n\r\n - Build in retention-driving elements: pattern breaks, B-roll cuts, text overlays, zoom transitions, and visual pacing that keeps viewers watching\n\r\n- Add captions, lower thirds, and on-screen graphics that match our bold, clean brand style\n\r\n- Work from scripts and run sheets to ensure the final edit delivers on the video’s strategic intent\n\r\n- Implement feedback quickly and maintain version control across all edits\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Short-Form Social Content\n\r\n- Edit 7–10+ short-form videos per week (Reels, Shorts, TikToks) from existing long-form footage and dedicated shoots\n\r\n -Hook-first editing - the first 1–2 seconds must stop the scroll every time\n\r\n -Add captions (animated/styled), trending audio where relevant, and platform-optimised formatting\n\r\n -Adapt content for each platform’s native format and best practices\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Podcast Editing\n\r\n- Edit 1 podcast episode every two weeks.\n\r\n- Clean audio, balance levels, remove dead air and filler while maintaining natural conversational flow\n\r\n- Add visual elements: speaker labels, topic transitions, key quote highlights, and chapter markers\n\r\n- Pull 3–5 highlight clips per episode for social repurposing\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Ad Creatives (As Needed)\n\r\n- Edit ad creatives following our proven structures (hook ? agitate ? pivot ? value ? CTA)\n\r\n- Create multiple variations of hooks and CTAs for testing\n\r\n- Quick turnarounds - ad creatives often need 24–48 hour delivery\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Organisation & Workflow\n\r\n- Upload all final exports and project files to Google Drive in our folder structure\n\r\n- Update ClickUp tasks with status, delivery links, and notes\n\r\n- Maintain clear file naming conventions and organised project folders\n\r\n- Communicate proactively via Slack - flag blockers early, confirm receipt of briefs, share progress\n\r\n\n\r\nWeekly Deliverables\n\r\n- Long-form YouTube videos edited and delivered (1 per week)\n\r\n- Short-form social videos (Reels / Shorts / TikTok) (5–8+ per week)\n\r\n- Podcast episodes edited (audio) (1 every two weeks)\n\r\n- Ad creatives (when briefed)\n\r\n- As needed, 24–48hr turnaround\n\r\n\n\r\nTools & Tech\n\r\n\n\r\nVideo Editing: Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve preferred.

If you don't follow the instructions at the bottom, your application will be ignored.\n\r\nWe're a fast-growing business credit and funding consultancy helping entrepreneurs access $50K–$150K in business funding. We're looking for a reliable Credit Repair Specialist VA to join the team on a per-task basis.\n\r\nWe provide training on our systems, templates, and processes. However, you must have prior experience working at a credit repair company. Never worked in credit repair before? This isn't the right fit.\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\nThere are two distinct task types.\n\r\nCredit Repair — You'll execute dispute letters using our pre-built templates and attack flow, submitting disputes through the CFPB. Everything gets notated in the system as you go. Our system tells you exactly what to do.\n\r\nFile Prep — You'll clean up client files for funding by removing old inquiries, addresses, names, and employment history using our templates. When needed, you'll make follow-up calls to remove inquiries within 72 hours. Everything gets notated.\n\r\nCompensation & Growth\n\r\nThis role is per task. Rates are as follows:\n\r\nCredit Repair Client — $20 per client\n\r\nFile Prep (standard inquiry removal, addresses, names, employment) — $10 per file\n\r\nExpedited Inquiry Removal (follow-up call to remove within 72 hours) — $20 per client\n\r\nThis role starts per task. As you prove your work and reliability, you transition into a full-time hourly position at $4–$5 per hour based on performance. From there, top performers get the opportunity to learn the funding side of the business—which comes with bonus opportunities on top of your base rate.\n\r\nThis is a real opportunity with a clear path forward.\n\r\nWho We're Looking For\n\r\nMust have prior experience working at a credit repair company. Familiar with Credit Repair Cloud or similar software. Detail-oriented, follows systems precisely, reliable, and communicates clearly.\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nAll of the following are required or your application will not be reviewed:\n\r\nUse \"Paper Route Ready - [Your Name]\" as your subject line\n\r\nTell us in 2–3 sentences about your experience working at a credit repair company\n\r\nWhat software have you used? (Credit Repair Cloud, DisputeBee, etc.)\n\r\nWhat is the difference between CFPB and an FTC report?\n\r\nHow many clients were you managing at a time at your last credit repair job?\n\r\nWhat's your availability and time zone?\n\r\nWhy are you looking for a new opportunity right now?\n\r\nApplications that don't follow these instructions exactly will be deleted.

Lawyer uploads a voice recording from a client consultation (30-60 minutes)\n\n2. AI system automatically transcribes the conversation\n\n3. AI extracts key information (names, dates, case type, facts, legal issues)\n\n4.

All documents are organized into the correct folder structure, named properly, and ready for lawyer review\n\n6. Lawyer spends 10 minutes reviewing instead of 3 hours drafting\n\n\n\nWe need someone who can turn this vision into reality.\n\n \n\nWhat You'll Build\n\n\n\nPhase 1: Voice-to-Text Pipeline\n\n• Integration with Whisper API, AssemblyAI, or similar transcription services\n\n• Speaker diarization (identifying who said what - lawyer vs. client)\n\n• Timestamp extraction for key moments\n\n• Quality checking and error handling for poor audio\n\nPhase 2: AI Document Generation Engine\n\n• Claude API integration for intelligent document drafting\n\n• Prompt engineering to extract legal information from transcripts\n\n• Template-based document generation using our precedents\n\n• Multi-document workflows (generating 5-10 documents from one consultation)\n\nPhase 3: Smart Organization System\n\n• Automated folder creation based on case type\n\n• Follows document naming conventions (e.g., \"Case 5834_Li_EngagementLetter.docx\")\n\n• Integration with case management software or OneDrive structure\n\n• Metadata tagging for easy searching\n\nPhase 4: Quality Control & Human Review\n\n• Dashboard showing which documents need lawyer review\n\n• Version control for edited documents\n\n• Error alerts when AI can't extract required information or complete task (your automations must alert us when something breaks, not fail silently)\n\n \n\nRequired Skills (We Will Test You On These)\n\nMust Have:\n\n• Advanced Make.com or Zapier expertise - Multi-step workflows with 15+ actions, conditional logic, loops, and error handlers\n\n• AI API integration experience - You must have actually worked with Anthropic Claude API, or similar. We will ask for examples.\n\n• Voice/Audio processing - Experience with integrating Whisper API, AssemblyAI, or Rev AI into a larger automated workflow for transcription\n\n• Document generation automation - Creating Word/PDF documents from templates using AI-generated content\n\n• Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 automation - Advanced Word/OneDrive manipulation\n\n• Prompt engineering - You understand how to write prompts that reliably extract structured data from unstructured conversations and integrate built-in prompts that the AI will retain\n\n\n\nBonus Points:\n\n• Experience with legal documents or legal tech\n\n• Python/JavaScript for custom integrations\n\n• Knowledge of ActionStep or other database tools for case management\n\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\n\n: \n\n\n\nYour application MUST include:\n\n1. Proof of AI Automation Experience\n\n  Screenshots or Loom video of AI-powered workflows you've built\n\n  Examples must show: API calls, data transformation, document generation\n\n  Generic Zapier workflows (like \"Gmail to Slack\") don't count\n\n\n\n2. Answer This Scenario (Be Specific):\n\n\"A lawyer uploads a 45-minute MP3 file of a client consultation about a contract dispute. Your system needs to:\n\n Transcribe the audio\n\n Extract: client name, opposing party, contract date, breach details\n\n Generate: engagement letter, retainer agreement, demand letter or other documents specified by lawyer in the audio\n\n Save everything to a folder named 'ClientName_ContractDispute_2024'\n\nWalk me through:\n\n Which specific tools/APIs you would use for each step\n\n How you would handle errors (bad audio, missing information)\n\n How you would format the AI prompts to extract legal information\n\n How you would ensure document quality is good enough for lawyer review\"\n\n\n\n3. Portfolio Requirements:\n\n Link to AI automation projects you've completed\n\n Must show Make.com/Zapier workflows OR custom code integrations\n\n Extra points for video walkthrough of a complex workflow\n\n\n\n4. Technical Setup:\n\n Do you have backup power and internet?\n\n What timezone can you work in?\n\n Have you used AI APIs before? Which ones?\n\n\n\nWhat We Offer\n\n• Ownership of a transformative project - You'll build something that actually changes how lawyers work\n\n• Casual or long-term position – You’ll work with a growing law firm\n\n• Cutting-edge tech - You'll work with the latest AI tools and APIs\n\n• Autonomy - We'll tell you what we need; you design how to build it\n\n\n\nWhy This Role Is Different\n\n\n\nMost VA jobs are about doing repetitive tasks faster. This role is about eliminating repetitive tasks entirely.\n\nIf you've ever thought \"There has to be a better way than doing this manually\" - this job is for you.\n\nIf you get excited about making AI do the boring work so humans can focus on strategy - this job is for you.\n\nIf you want to build something that actually matters and saves lawyers hundreds of hours per month - apply now.\n\n \n\nWe're not looking for the cheapest hire. We're looking for the right hire. If you're a true AI automation expert, prove it in your application.                ",

We operate multiple fast-growing brands and generate millions in annual revenue. Our ambition: become a top 5 seller on \n within 3 years by building a scalable and dominant structure.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe role\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not looking for a manager. We are looking for a commercial builder.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs Marketplace & Growth Director, You own topline performance on [\n](\n) and execute growth within the strategic direction set by the CEO. You own revenue growth, ranking, review acceleration, conversion, pricing, promotions, Customer Experience (CX), affiliate growth, and overall \n account strategy. You report directly to the CEO.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Scope guardrails:** everything you do must increase \n revenue. No webshop initiatives. \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 1 – First 90 days: understand, execute, and build\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will go deep into the operation. You work closely with CX, analyze reviews, returns, pricing, and advertising, and learn how our business and [\n](\n) truly operate.\n\r\n\n\r\nA large part of your early focus will be building the Customer Experience and review engine. This includes analyzing reviews and returns, identifying structural issues, and building scalable processes that improve rating, trust, and ranking.\n\r\n\n\r\nAt the same time, you execute review & relevance growth: influencer outreach via social media, building affiliate partnerships, and testing additional channels that increase ranking and visibility on [\n](\n).\n\r\n\n\r\nYour goal: identify the main leverage points, take immediate action where impact is highest, and bring structure to KPIs, processes, and priorities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 2 – Scale and lead\n\r\n\n\r\nOnce the foundation is in place, you lead CX, build the commercial team, and focus on commercial optimization and scaling. You evolve from builder to leader. Phase 2 may still include some operational responsibilities, but the ultimate goal is to gradually phase out all operational tasks within the team so you can fully focus on leadership, strategy, and growth.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you will do\n\r\n- Structure and lead CX\n\r\n- Optimize listings and advertising (together with our PPC partner)\n\r\n- Define pricing and promotion strategies\n\r\n- Build and scale review, influencer, and affiliate acceleration\n\r\n- Turn returns/refund data into product and process improvements\n\r\n- KPI reporting (scorecard)\n\r\n- Bi-weekly alignment with CEO (priorities + decisions)\n\r\n- Act as the strategic counterpart for \n\r\n\n\r\nNo overanalysis.

No generic marketing stories.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we offer\n\r\n\n\r\nA key leadership role with direct impact. Full commercial ownership and the opportunity to build Onebird’s entire \n growth engine.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a safe hire.

This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.\n\r\n\n\r\n4 You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit[a] of truth and the spirit of falsehood.\n\r\n\n\r\nGod’s Love and Ours\n\r\n7 Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 10 This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. 11 Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.\n\r\n\n\r\n13 This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 16 And so we know and rely on the love God has for us.\n\r\n\n\r\nGod is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. 17 This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus. 18 There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.\n\r\n\n\r\n19 We love because he first loved us. 20 Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. 21 And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister.

    "description": "\n                    Role:\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Executive Virtual Assistant is the operational backbone of a fast-growing financial advisory firm. You'll work directly with the Chief Revenue Officer to eliminate bottlenecks, execute processes, and keep systems running so leadership can focus on strategy instead of admin.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't a \"check your\n and schedule meetings\" VA role. You'll be inside HubSpot pulling reports and executing outreach, posting social media replies through Sprout Social, coordinating contractors, running SMS broadcasts, and keeping our project management system clean and current. You'll follow SOPs we've already built, but you'll also be expected to flag when something is broken and suggest a better way.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's what you'll actually do:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Post AI-generated social media replies across\n, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and X through Sprout Social — reviewing each for quality before publishing\n\r\n- Manage SMS broadcast campaigns — pulling lists from HubSpot, scheduling sends, and monitoring delivery\n\r\n- Pull and compile reports from HubSpot — surfacing key metrics, pipeline snapshots, and deal activity summaries so leadership doesn't have to dig for information\n\r\n- Keep our project management system (Asana) organized — chasing tea\nmbers for status updates, archiving dead projects, and ensuring dashboards reflect reality\n\r\n- Handle webinar logistics — registration list management, reminder sequences, post-event follow-up segmentation, and replay distribution\n\r\n- Coordinate marketing contractors — collecting deliverables, tracking deadlines, routing approvals, and following up so nothing falls through the cracks\n\r\n\n\r\nTo win in this role, you need to be detail-oriented, proactive, and comfortable working across multiple platforms simultaneously. You should be someone who takes ownership of processes — not someone who waits to be told what to do next.\n\r\n\n\r\n## Why This Role Matters (for You):\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want to learn how a high-growth US financial services company actually operates — from sales pipelines to marketing automation to client experience — this role gives you a front-row seat.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll work directly with leadership, not through layers of middle management. You'll touch every part of the business: sales ops, marketing, content, client experience, and technology. That breadth of exposure is rare and will make you significantly more valuable in any future role.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe invest in training. We have documented SOPs, video walkthroughs, and AI tools that do the heavy thinking — your job is reliable execution and continuous improvement. We don't micromanage, but we do expect ownership.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you thrive in structured environments where the playbook exists and you just need to run it well — you'll love this. If you need someone standing over your shoulder to stay productive, this isn't the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n## Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\n- Execute social media engagement workflows daily — reviewing AI-generated replies for tone and accuracy, then publishing through Sprout Social across all platforms\n\r\n- Manage and send SMS marketing broadcasts using our SMS platform, including list preparation and scheduling\n\r\n- Own the YouTube production coordination workflow — tracking recurring tasks, managing approvals, and ensuring content ships on schedule\n\r\n- Compile weekly CRM reports — pulling pipeline snapshots, deal velocity metrics, and activity summaries from HubSpot so leadership has what they need without digging for it\n\r\n- Maintain project management hygiene in Asana — collecting status updates, archiving completed or abandoned projects, and keeping dashboards accurate\n\r\n- Coordinate webinar operations end-to-end — from registration list pulls through post-event follow-up sequences\n\r\n- Serve as the communication layer between leadership and marketing contractors — tracking deliverables, deadlines, and approvals\n\r\n- Document and improve processes — when you find a better way to do something, write it down so it scales\n\r\n\n\r\n## Results\n\r\n\n\r\n- Social media replies posted within 24 hours of comment, with zero off-brand or inaccurate responses published\n\r\n- Weekly CRM reports delivered on time — leadership has pipeline and activity visibility without asking for it\n\r\n- Asana dashboards reflect actual project status — every active project has a current status update\n\r\n- Webinar logistics executed without missed steps — registrations captured, reminders sent, follow-ups segmented\n\r\n- Contractor deliverables tracked and delivered on time — nothing falls through the cracks between request and completion\n\r\n\n\r\n## Requirements\n\r\n\n\r\n- 3+ years of experience as a Virtual Assistant, Executive Assistant, or Operations Coordinator supporting US-based businesses\n\r\n- Strong working knowledge of HubSpot CRM (deal management, contact properties, list building, task management)\n\r\n- Experience with social media management tools (Sprout Social preferred, but Hootsuite, Buffer, or similar accepted)\n\r\n- Proficiency in project management tools (Asana, Monday, ClickUp, or similar)\n\r\n- Excellent written English — you'll be reviewing client-facing social media content in a regulated industry\n\r\n- Highly organized with strong attention to detail — financial services has zero tolerance for sloppy mistakes\n\r\n- Self-motivated and proactive — you flag problems before they become emergencies\n\r\n- Comfortable learning new tools quickly — we use HubSpot, Sprout Social, Asana, Slack, SalesMessage, Google Workspace, and several other platforms\n\r\n- Reliable internet connection and a quiet workspace for occasional video calls\n\r\n\n\r\n## Nice to Have (Not Required)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience in financial services, wealth management, or insurance industries\n\r\n- Familiarity with SMS marketing platforms (SalesMessage, ClickSend, or similar)\n\r\n- Experience with webinar platforms (EverWebinar, Zoom Webinars, or similar)\n\r\n- Basic understanding of sales pipelines and CRM workflows\n\r\n- Experience coordinating with contractors or freelancers\n\r\n\n\r\n## Schedule & Compensation\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Hours:** Full-time (40 hours/week)\n\r\n- **Schedule:** Flexible, with 3-4 hours of overlap required during US Mountain Time business hours (9 AM – 5 PM MT) for real-time communication and approvals\n\r\n- **Rate:** $7–$10/hour USD, depending on experience\n\r\n- **Type:** Long-term, ongoing position — this is not a project-based role\n\r\n\n\r\n## About Us\n\r\n\n\r\nQ3 Advisors is a flat-fee fiduciary financial advisory firm specializing in Roth conversion strategies. We've grown from $1.9M to $15M+ in revenue in three years with a lean, high-performance team. We move fast, we build systems, and we take care of our people.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll be joining a team that includes sales reps, financial planners, marketing specialists, and operations staff — all working together to help retirees keep more of their money. The work matters, the team is sharp, and the company is growing.                ",

If your responses are generic or overly formal, we'll pass. If your video intro was recorded 6 months ago for a different company, that's an automatic disqualification.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe want to see:\n\r\n-Your actual personality\n\r\n-How you think and communicate\n\r\n-Why you specifically are interested in this role\n\r\n\n\r\nWe don't want:\n\r\n-Generic cover letter language\n\r\n-AI-generated responses with no personal touch\n\r\n-Recycled video introductions\n\r\n-Corporate buzzwords\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you can't be bothered to personalize your application to VAAS, we can't be bothered to review it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're VAAS, a US-based video and motion design studio working with SaaS companies, venture capital firms, and tech-enabled businesses.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's what's happening:\n\r\n-We're in the process of rebuilding our entire operation to work differently than most video studios.\n\r\n-The goal: AI handles logistics and operations, so creatives can focus on judgment, taste, and craft.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're building an agentic system where:\n\r\n-Client requests get translated into structured briefs automatically\n\r\n-Project management and file organization happen in the background\n\r\n-You get clean inputs and creative clarity, not chaos\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd we want someone who's excited to be part of that transformation.\n\r\nWhat this means for you:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. You'll learn AI tools as we adopt them — We're actively experimenting with AI for asset generation, ideation, video generation, VO, and workflow automation. You'll build these skills in real time\n\r\n2. You'll help shape the workflow — Since we're building this, your feedback matters. What slows you down? What needs to be clearer? You'll have input\n\r\n3. You'll focus more on creative work over time — As we systemize operations, less of your day will be admin and back-and-forth. More will be actual design and motion work\n\r\n4. Future-proof skills — You'll learn how to work with AI, not compete against it. That's what will matter in 2-3 years\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we're looking for:\n\r\nA motion designer who wants to be dangerously good and who's curious about how AI changes creative work.\n\r\nYou should have:\n\r\n\n\r\n-Taste — You can explain why something works or doesn't beyond \"I like it\"\n\r\n-Design literacy — You understand hierarchy, pacing, color, type, composition\n\r\n-Curiosity about AI — You don't need to be technical, but you should want to learn tools like Runway, Kling, ChatGPT, ElevenLabs, etc.\n\r\n-Ownership — You don't wait for pixel-perfect instructions. You think, propose, refine\n\r\n-Range — Comfortable with kinetic type, product UI animation, mixed media, editorial pacing\n\r\n-Adaptability — You're joining a studio that's evolving. That means some processes will change as we improve them\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you'll work on:\n\r\n-SaaS product explainers and animations\n\r\n-Founder-led content with motion graphics and design overlays\n\r\n-Testimonial videos with branded treatments\n\r\n-Event recaps and sizzle reels\n\r\n-Podcast clips elevated beyond template edits\n\r\n-Fixed-scope product animation projects (30–90 seconds, premium client work)\n\r\n-Experimenting with AI video tools on real projects (with creative direction)\n\r\n\n\r\nTools you'll use:\n\r\n-After Effects (required)\n\r\n-Premiere Pro (required)\n\r\n-Figma (for design frames and direction)\n\r\n\n (reviews)\n\r\n-AI tools — We're adopting Runway, Kling, ElevenLabs, ChatGPT, and others. We'll learn together\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we care about:\n\r\n-Can you make a talking head video feel premium without overproducing it?\n\r\n-Can you animate a SaaS product demo that's clear, not chaotic?\n\r\n-Are you curious about how AI can speed up execution without killing taste?\n\r\n-Do you solve problems or wait for instructions?\n\r\n-Can you explain why you made a creative choice?\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we don't care about:\n\r\n-Viral tricks or \n edits\n\r\n-Template-driven bulk content\n\r\n-Trend-chasing for the sake of trends\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy this role is different:\n\r\nMost editing jobs treat you like a production line. You get specs, you execute, repeat.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere, you'll:\n\r\n-Work on projects where the goal is credibility and craft, not just volume\n\r\n-Have creative input, not just execute orders\n\r\n-Learn AI tools that most Filipino editors don't touch\n\r\n-Be part of a small team rethinking how creative studios operate\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you'll gain:\n\r\n-Hands-on experience with AI video and creative tools\n\r\n-Exposure to high-end SaaS, VC, and tech clients\n\r\n-Portfolio work that's elevated, not template spam\n\r\n-Skills that differentiate you in the creative market\n\r\n-A chance to help shape how the studio works\n\r\n\n\r\nThe honest truth:\n\r\nWe're not a massive agency. We're a small, focused team. We're building systems that don't fully exist yet. If you want everything polished and buttoned-up from day one, this isn't the role.\n\r\n\n\r\nBut if you're curious, ambitious, and want to be part of something that's ahead of where most studios are going, this could be a great fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow this works:\n\r\nWe'll start with a project-based relationship — real client work, real deadlines, real collaboration.\n\r\nThis lets us both figure out if it's the right fit:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Do you work well with our creative direction style?\n\r\n2. Do you take ownership of projects?\n\r\n3. Do we communicate clearly?\n\r\n4. Is the work energizing or draining for you?\n\r\n\n\r\nIf it works, we'll transition to a full-time role with consistent projects, growth opportunities, and long-term partnership.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf it doesn't, no hard feelings you'll have added solid portfolio pieces and learned some new tools.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're looking for a long-term tea\nmber, but we want to make sure we're both confident before making that commitment.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication requirements:\n\r\n\n\r\nSend us:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Portfolio — 5–8 examples of motion work you're proud of (Vimeo, Drive, or portfolio site). Please do not send a google drive link with every video you have created. Show me your best work you are most proud of.\n\r\n2. A video intro, tell us about yourself. What you like to do in your free time, where you hang out on the internet, how you got into motion design, what you are looking for in your career, and why you think you are the right fit for this job.\n\r\n3. AI curiosity check — Have you used any AI tools for video, design, or creative work? If yes, what? If no, what are you curious about?\n\r\n4. Why VAAS — 3–4 sentences on why this role interests you (real reasoning, not a cover letter)\n\r\n5. Availability — Can you start with project-based work in the next 2–4 weeks?\n\r\n\n\r\nDetails:\n\r\n-Starts as project-based, transitions to full-time for the right person\n\r\n-Project rate: Competitive per-project pricing based on scope\n\r\n-Full-time rate (if we move forward): $900–$1,300/month depending on experience\n\r\n-Remote, flexible hours\n\r\n-Reports to: Founder                ",

We are looking for an organized \"Operator\" to run our production line.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are a creative writer who wants to write your own stories, DO NOT APPLY.\n\r\nIf you are a highly organized Project Manager who loves AI tools, checklists, and hitting deadlines, this is for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR ROLE:\n\r\nYou will be the \"Engine\" of our production. You will take ideas, turn them into assets using our AI tools, and manage our team of editors to ensure videos are finished on time.\n\r\n\n\r\nSPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES:\n\r\n1. AI Script Generation (Daily):\n\r\n- You will take approved topics from our Trello board.\n\r\n- You will use our specific \"Prompt Guide\" and Claude AI to generate scripts.\n\r\n- You will compile the script sections into Google Docs.

Quality Control & Uploading:\n\r\n- When an editor submits a video, you check it using our checklist.\n\r\n- If it passes, you upload it to YouTube using our Templates.\n\r\n- If it fails, you tag the editor for revisions.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\r\n- EXTREMELY ORGANIZED: You will manage up to 6 channels.
