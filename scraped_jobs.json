This is a pathway to becoming a media buyer.Here's why this works: The best media buyers aren't just button-clickers — they're data detectives who can read campaign performance, spot opportunities, and make smart decisions based on numbers.\n\r\nYour Journey:\n\r\nWeeks 1-2: Master our data systems, build dashboards, learn to read campaign metrics inside-out\n\r\nWeeks 3-6: Shadow media buying, start managing small test campaigns, apply your data insights to real budget decisions\n\r\nWeeks 6-12: Own your first full campaigns, make optimization decisions, become a data-driven media buyer\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll learn media buying through the lens of data first — which means you'll understand the \"why\" behind every decision, not just the \"how.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 1: Data Foundation (Weeks 1-2)\n\r\n* Pull performance data from Google Ads, Meta Ads Manager, and other platforms\n\r\n* Build and maintain tracking dashboards in Google Sheets (and later, Data Studio/Looker)\n\r\n* Monitor campaign KPIs: CPA, CTR, conversion rate, ROAS, lead quality scores\n\r\n* Flag any anomalies or performance issues to the media buying team\n\r\n* Create performance reports that summarize what happened and why\n\r\n* Identify trends: which ad creatives are winning, which audiences convert best, where we're wasting budget\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 2: Media Buying Apprenticeship (Weeks 3-6)\n\r\n* Shadow our media buying process across Meta, Google, and other platforms\n\r\n* Set up campaigns using Google Ads Editor and Meta Ads Manager (we'll teach you)\n\r\n* Monitor daily performance and flag any issues or opportunities\n\r\n* Learn how to read data: CTR, CPA, conversion rates, and what they mean\n\r\n* Assist with creative briefing and A/B test tracking\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 3: Media Buyer (Weeks 6-12)\n\r\n\n\r\n* Manage smaller test budgets independently\n\r\n* Run weekly performance analysis and suggest optimizations\n\r\n* Collaborate with the creative team to test new ad angles\n\r\n* Start building \"recovery plans\" when campaigns underperform\n\r\n* Own full campaign lifecycles from setup to scale\n\r\n* Identify new platform opportunities (TikTok, Native, Bing, etc.)\n\r\n* Present performance insights to clients or internal stakeholders\n\r\n* Propose and execute growth experiments\n\r\n\n\r\nYOU’LL THRIVE IN THIS ROLE IF YOU…\n\r\n\n\r\n*  Want to build a career in marketing: You're not just interested in AI for AI's sake — you want to use it to drive real business results\n\r\n* Are a fast learner: You don't need to know media buying now, but you need to pick things up quickly.\n\r\n* Love numbers: You're comfortable with spreadsheets and can spot patterns in data.\n\r\n* Are naturally curious: You ask \"why\" and \"what if\" constantly.\n\r\n* Take ownership: You don't wait to be told what to do — you figure it out.\n\r\n* Communicate clearly: You can explain your thinking and findings in writing.\n\r\n* Are proactive: If something's broken, you fix it. If something's unclear, you ask.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\n* Strong Google Sheets or Excel skills (formulas, pivot tables, data analysis).\n\r\n* Basic understanding of digital advertising (even if just from using\n/Instagram).\n\r\n* Willingness to learn technical tools: Google Ads Editor, Meta Ads Manager, tracking systems\n\r\n* English Fluency: Excellent written and spoken English for internal meetings and ad copy testing.\n\r\n* Analytical Mindset: You must be comfortable with complex data interpretation and presenting findings to the team.\n\r\n* A strong interest in AI, marketing, and scalable business systems.\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to have:\n\r\n* Any prior experience with paid ads (even personal projects or small freelance work)\n\r\n* Familiarity with marketing metrics (CPC, CPA, ROAS, CTR, etc.)\n\r\n* Familiarity with AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini\n\r\n* Experience in marketing, eCommerce, or analytics roles\n\r\n\n\r\nMost Important:\n\r\n\n\r\n* You're hungry to grow and see this as a career opportunity, not just a job\n\r\n* You're detail-oriented — small mistakes in media buying can cost thousands\n\r\n* You're resilient — campaigns fail sometimes; you learn and move forward\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT MAKES THIS ROLE DIFFERENT\n\r\n\n\r\n* Direct Impact: You’ll be working directly with the paid media director in a high-growth environment. Your decisions will move the needle every single day.\n\r\n* Continuous Learning: We move fast. You’ll be expected to learn new tools (including AI-driven workflows) and improve your strategy weekly.\n\r\n* Data-First Culture: We don’t guess. We test, analyze, and iterate. If you love performance marketing, you’ll love our process.\n\r\n* A-Player Environment: We only hire smart, capable, self-motivated people.

We are looking for new products for which the packaging design is not done efficiently. We then make it more efficient, and this gives us a competitive advantage. For that development process, we sometimes have to change the product design, open new factory molds, or need to come up with other creative solutions. When our products are developed (by you in collaboration with a Chinese factory) and produced, our Supply Chain management from China to Europe works as follows: We usually have one 40ft EXW shipment per month from China to Europe that is set for a specific departure date. For this shipment, all orders from different suppliers (with production times ranging from 15-60 days) should arrive in time. All information (CI and PL) from all suppliers must be combined so that the customs clearance process is easy. This entire process is not documented in the form of SOPs yet, so we will have to create them together during the first month.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Are Looking For :\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are seeking an experienced professional who can take ownership of the entire product development and logistics process. (Initially a part-time role, with full-time opportunities potentially becoming available later.)\n\r\n\n\r\nYour responsibilities will include:\n\r\n- Product development and sourcing from China\n\r\n- Minimum of 5 years of experience in private label procurement.\n\r\n- Product quality control\n\r\n- Ensuring efficient packaging and carton sizing\n\r\n- Accounting support, including creating and verifying invoices\n\r\n- Supply chain planning\n\r\n- Managing lead times and shipping timelines (minimum 5 years of experience required).\n\r\n- Supply forecasting and inventory management\n\r\n- Managing international shipments\n\r\n\n\r\n(You will be responsible for overseeing the full workflow—from product development to logistics coordination.)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have:\n\r\n\n\r\n- At least 5 years of experience working with Chinese suppliers for FBA and private label businesses\n\r\n- Advanced proficiency in Excel/Google Sheets\n\r\n- Experience in data analysis\n\r\n- Proven experience managing international shipments\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Get:\n\r\nWork mostly during Philippine hours to stay in contact with China, but you will also need to be available in the evening (until 22:00–00:00 PH time) to communicate with our European-based office.\n\r\n\n\r\n*How to apply (we can only accept candidates who applied using the application form)\n\r\n*Make sure to include your portfolio link in the application form\n\r\n\n\r\n\n . gle /ooUdxu2pjqHbQnap8\n\r\n\n\r\n1.

When you perform well, our clients get more estimates on the books, which means they grow—and so do we.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\n- Answering inbound calls from homeowners who have inquired about fence estimates through our clients' ads\n\r\n- Making outbound calls to follow up with new leads generated from\n and Google ad campaigns\n\r\n- Having friendly, professional conversations with homeowners to understand their fencing needs\n\r\n- Qualifying leads and scheduling fence estimate appointments on the contractor's calendar\n\r\n- Representing multiple fence contractor clients in a professional and knowledgeable manner\n\r\n- Keeping all lead activity, call notes, and appointment details organized in GoHighLevel (our CRM)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For\n\r\n- Fluent English: You need to speak and write English clearly and naturally. This is the most important requirement—no exceptions. You'll be speaking directly with US homeowners on behalf of our clients.\n\r\n- Solid Work Ethic: Show up, do the work, hit your targets. We need someone reliable and self-motivated.\n\r\n- Available Full-Time: 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM CST, Monday through Friday. This schedule is required.\n\r\n- Experience: Prior experience in appointment setting, inbound/outbound calling, or customer service is a big plus.\n\r\n- Fence/Contractor Knowledge: Not required. We'll train you on the industry, the services our clients offer, and how to handle common homeowner questions.\n\r\n- Comfortable with Tech: You'll be using GoHighLevel and other online tools daily.\n\r\n\n\r\nVideo Required\n\r\nWe want to hear you speak. Please submit a short video (1-2 minutes) where you introduce yourself, talk about any relevant experience, and tell us why you'd be a good fit. This helps us evaluate your English skills and how you come across on the phone with homeowners.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Get\n\r\n- Competitive salary\n\r\n- 13th Month Bonus: 100% of one month's salary paid every December\n\r\n- Training and support—we'll get you up to speed on the fence industry and our clients' businesses\n\r\n- Long-term position with room to grow as we expand this service\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nSend your resume and a link to your video to \n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you.

We're looking for a senior Android engineer who thrives in fast-paced fintech environments and can help us build a production-ready, secure, and scalable mobile wallet from the ground up.\n\r\nRequired Technical Skills\n\r\n\n\r\nMust-Have Experience\n\r\n• 8+ years of Android development with production apps in Google Play Store\n\r\n• 5+ years of Kotlin with demonstrated expertise in modern Android development\n\r\n• Jetpack Compose for building modern, reactive UIs\n\r\n• Clean Architecture / MVVM with clear separation of concerns\n\r\n• Financial/Payment Integration experience (payment gateways, card processing, digital wallets)\n\r\n• Security-first mindset: Experience with encryption, secure storage, certificate pinning, biometric auth\n\r\n• Local database management (Room, SQLite) with complex queries and migrations\n\r\n• RESTful API integration with authentication, error handling, and retry logic\n\r\n• Git version control with branching strategies and code review practices\n\r\n\n\r\nStrongly Preferred\n\r\n• Experience with Coroutines and Flow for asynchronous programming\n\r\n• Push notification implementation (FCM) with deep linking\n\r\n• QR code generation and scanning libraries\n\r\n• Dagger/Hilt dependency injection\n\r\n• JUnit, Espresso, MockK for comprehensive testing\n\r\n• Experience building highly regulated applications (fintech, healthcare, government)\n\r\n• PCI-DSS compliance knowledge and implementation experience\n\r\n• CI/CD setup with GitHub Actions, Bitrise, or similar\n\r\n• Experience with A/B testing frameworks and feature flags\n\r\n• Knowledge of accessibility standards and inclusive design\n\r\n\n\r\nBig Plus\n\r\n• Previous experience building mobile wallet, payment, or banking applications\n\r\n• Integration with card networks (Visa, Mastercard) or payment processors\n\r\n• Experience with identity verification (IDology, Jumio, Onfido)\n\r\n• Knowledge of financial regulations and compliance requirements\n\r\n• Experience with AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codeium)\n\r\n• Backend API experience (Java, .NET, Node.js, or similar) for better API collaboration\n\r\n• iOS development experience (nice to have for cross-platform perspective)\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Startup DNA We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a role for engineers who:\n\r\n• Need detailed specifications before starting work\n\r\n• Prefer maintaining existing codebases over building greenfield\n\r\n• Require close supervision or hand-holding\n\r\n• Want stable, slow-moving corporate environments\n\r\n• Are uncomfortable with ambiguity or rapidly changing requirements\n\r\n\n\r\nThis IS a role for engineers who:\n\r\n• Self-start: You can take a PRD and run with it, asking clarifying questions but not waiting for perfect specs\n\r\n• Pivot quickly: Requirements will change as we validate with users and regulators\n\r\n• Think like an owner: You care about the business outcomes, not just writing code\n\r\n• Move fast with quality: Speed matters, but so does security and reliability in fintech\n\r\n• Embrace AI tools: You see Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot as force multipliers, not cheating\n\r\n• Communicate proactively: You flag risks early, document decisions, and keep stakeholders informed\n\r\n• Have fintech battle scars: You've dealt with payment failures, fraud attempts, and compliance audits\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy OutsideHire?\n\r\n\n\r\n• Inclusive Environment: Dynamic work environment that values creativity and collaboration\n\r\n• Cutting-Edge Projects: Modern, well-architected platform with best-in-class tools\n\r\n• Impact: Build systems that process real financial transactions\n\r\n• Modern Stack: Quarkus, Kotlin, AWS, and AI coding assistants\n\r\n• Competitive Benefits: Competitive salary, remote work, professional development\n\r\n• Growth Culture: Continuous learning, innovation, and recognition\n\r\n• Work-Life Balance: Semi-flexible hours, remote-first, sustainable pace\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nLast Updated: January 2026                ",
