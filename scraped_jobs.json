I’ll also be showing you my recommendations and ask for your opinions and advice. I’m building a small mini curriculum in Psychology to educate my friends, family and I. I’ll be working with a curriculum designer and I need help from a Psychology degree holder for d\n what should go on the curriculum and which resources (textbooks, online courses, or others) I should use and in what order.\n\r\n\n\r\nSkills Needed:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Degree in Psychology - 4 or 6 year degree preferred.\n\r\n- Experience in educating on Psychology - Preferred, not required.\n\r\n- Quick access to resources or an understanding that could help in determining how to structure a Psychology curriculum.

You should be highly skilled in AI-assisted content workflows and understand how to iterate fast without sacrificing quality or brand consistency.\n\r\n\n\r\nBecause the business operates in the gaming space, the ideal candidate has strong video game knowledge and understands gaming culture, terminology, and trends so content feels native to the audience.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Do Every Day (Plain Language)\n\r\n1) Run the daily content operation\n\r\n\n\r\nEnsure content goes out every day across all required platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\nOwn the content calendar and daily posting priorities.\n\r\n\n\r\nMaintain a consistent “gaming voice” that feels natural in gamer communities.\n\r\n\n\r\n2) Lead the Social Media Manager and enforce quality\n\r\n\n\r\nAssign tasks, set expectations, and review output to maintain a high quality bar.\n\r\n\n\r\nImprove performance over time through feedback and clearer standards.\n\r\n\n\r\nKeep everything organized: schedule, queue, asset folders, and handoffs.\n\r\n\n\r\n3) Own multi-platform social execution\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are responsible for how the company shows up on\n Pages, Instagram, TikTok, and X/Twitter, including:\n\r\n\n\r\nPlanning, scheduling, publishing, and formatting content appropriately per platform.\n\r\n\n\r\nMaking sure captions, hashtags, and creative formats are platform-native rather than copy-pasted.\n\r\n\n\r\nCoordinating light community management and ensuring messages/comments are handled correctly.\n\r\n\n\r\n4) Produce YouTube content consistently (core output)\n\r\n\n\r\nA primary daily/regular deliverable is creating YouTube video compilations and related assets:\n\r\n\n\r\nSource, organize, and edit compilation-style videos with strong pacing and retention-friendly structure.\n\r\n\n\r\nRepurpose clips into Shorts/Reels/TikTok when possible.\n\r\n\n\r\nCreate strong thumbnails and titles aligned with channel style and performance goals.\n\r\n\n\r\n5) Use AI tools to create product images and video assets quickly\n\r\n\n\r\nYou should be comfortable using AI tools to produce and iterate:\n\r\n\n\r\nProduct/listing images, thumbnails, banners, and promotional creatives.\n\r\n\n\r\nShort promo clips and variations for testing.\n\r\n\n\r\nBackground assets and visual enhancements, while keeping output clean and consistent.\n\r\n\n\r\n6) Serve as the internal creative hub\n\r\n\n\r\nBe the main point of contact for teams needing image or video assets for products, promotions, or campaigns.\n\r\n\n\r\nCreate assets quickly, keep versions organized, and reduce bottlenecks.\n\r\n\n\r\nMaintain clear internal standards so visual output stays consistent across the company.\n\r\n\n\r\n7) Keep content authentic to gamers\n\r\n\n\r\nApply real gaming knowledge so content reflects community norms and expectations.\n\r\n\n\r\nCatch and fix anything that feels out of touch, generic, or inconsistent before it goes live.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Is (and Is Not)\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a leadership plus production role. You manage a direct report while also creating content yourself. It is fast-paced, requires consistent daily execution, and rewards someone who can build a repeatable system rather than relying on ad-hoc work.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Great Performance Looks Like\n\r\n\n\r\nDaily social output is reliable, on-brand, and improving in quality and engagement over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYouTube output becomes consistent, scalable, and performance-driven.\n\r\n\n\r\nProduct and marketing visuals are produced quickly with fewer internal bottlenecks.\n\r\n\n\r\nCreative output remains premium, consistent, and authentically aligned with gaming audiences.

What was the lesson you learned? I'd like to hear the back-end story.\n\r\n\n\r\n3) All moderation work has its emotional toll. Describe the specific type of user behavior or community conflict that you personally find the most emotionally draining to handle, and be honest about why it gets to you. More importantly, what specific, practical strategies have you developed to protect your own mental well-being and maintain objectivity when you have to deal with that exact situation?\n\r\n\n\r\n4) Handling a Delicate Situation: You notice a long-time, valuable community member has started making passive-aggressive comments that are discouraging new members but don't explicitly break any major rules. How would you handle this situation privately and publicly to protect the community's welcoming atmosphere without alienating the long-time member?\n\r\n\n\r\n5) Preferred Tool Stack: What are your go-to tools for social media management, community monitoring, or customer support? Please mention why you prefer them.\n\r\n\n\r\n6) AI in Your Workflow: Explain where and how you might use AI to improve your productivity, and where you believe a human touch is required while using AI tools in community management.\n\r\n\n\r\n7) Available Hours: Let us know your general availability (e.g., \"Approximately 20 hours per week, mostly flexible between 1PM - 8PM on Monday, 3 PM - 10PM on Tuesday, 12PM - 8PM on Wednesday, ...,  in Philippines time\").\n\r\n\n\r\n8) Available Period of Work: Let us know for how long you expect to work with this job.

Metrics could include team morale, retention rates, and the consistent achievement of project milestones. We'll go over those details once you've demonstrated your skills, but you should be comfortable working with just the base pay initially.\n\r\n\n\r\n[What You’ll Be Doing]\n\r\n\n\r\nYour role is to be the supportive and organizational heart of our virtual team. You will be responsible for creating a thriving work environment where every VA can perform at their best. Your main tasks will include:\n\r\n\n\r\na) Intelligent & Empathetic Task Delegation: Go beyond simple assignments by understanding each VA's unique skills and current workload. You will align tasks with individual strengths to boost job satisfaction and proactively balance workloads to prevent burnout.\n\r\n\n\r\nb) Proactive Communication & Culture Building: Establish and maintain clear communication channels, fostering an environment of psychological safety where tea\nmbers feel comfortable sharing ideas and concerns. You will actively promote team cohesion through virtual activities and celebrate both individual and team successes.\n\r\n\n\r\nc) Holistic Well-being & Performance Monitoring: Conduct regular, informal check-ins to gauge team morale and individual well-being, not just project status. You'll be responsible for observing early signs of stress or disengagement and proactively offering support.\n\r\n\n\r\nd) Constructive Feedback & Development: Provide regular, growth-oriented feedback designed to build skills and confidence. You will identify learning opportunities that align with each VA's career goals, acting as a champion for their professional development.\n\r\n\n\r\ne) Effective Conflict Resolution: Serve as a neutral and fair mediator in the event of misunderstandings or disagreements. Your emotional intelligence will be key to identifying potential issues before they escalate and guiding the team toward positive resolutions.\n\r\n\n\r\nf) Resource & Support Management: Ensure all tea\nmbers have the tools, information, and resources they need to excel. You will act as their primary advocate and a reliable point of contact for any challenges they may face.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Goal]\n\r\nThe ultimate goal is to build a high-performing, resilient, and motivated virtual team. By creating a foundation of trust, clear communication, and genuine support, you will ensure our projects are not only completed successfully but that our tea\nmbers feel valued, respected, and empowered to do their best work.

You can motivate, mediate, and communicate with tact and understanding.\n\r\n\n\r\nc) Is an Organized and Proactive Communicator: You are meticulous in your planning and clear in your communication. You don't wait for problems to arise; you anticipate needs and facilitate smooth workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\nd) Has a \"Player-Coach\" Mentality: You see your role as a leader who is invested in the success and well-being of your team, not just a manager who directs. You genuinely enjoy helping others grow.\n\r\n\n\r\ne) Is Proficient with Modern PM Tools: You are skilled in using project management and communication platforms (e.g., Asana, Trello, Slack, etc.) to foster collaboration and clarity.\n\r\n\n\r\nf) Communicates with Clarity and Values Respect: You are reliable, accountable, and can articulate your thoughts in a clear, logical manner.\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant Note:\n\r\nWe value respectful communication. What does it mean?\n\r\nMost importantly, if you need to step away, just let me or your manager know why and when. We understand it, even if you need to leave tomorrow, BUT ghosting is the last thing you'd like to do, since it causes confusion and delays.\n\r\nIn everyday conversations, our team thrives on mutual respect, no matter your role.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Why Work With Us?]\n\r\n\n\r\nFlexible hours to suit your lifestyle.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe opportunity to be a foundational leader in a people-first company culture.\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-term growth opportunities as our company scales.\n\r\n\n\r\nA supportive environment where your leadership and emotional intelligence are highly valued.\n\r\n\n\r\n[About Us]\n\r\nWe are a growing team dedicated to achieving our goals through a culture of collaboration and mutual support. We believe that our success is a direct result of our team's well-being and that a positive environment is essential for creating outstanding work. Your role is absolutely critical to making that belief a reality.\n\r\n\n\r\n[How to Apply]\n\r\nSubject Line: Start your title with either \"Project Manager\", or your application can't be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application, include:\n\r\n\n\r\n1) Work History: Share your resume, focusing on your experience leading, managing, or coordinating teams.\n\r\n\n\r\n2) Subtle Observation & Action: Imagine you notice one of your most reliable VAs has suddenly become very brief in their communications—using one-word answers and no emojis, which is highly unusual for them. Their work quality is still excellent, but they seem disengaged. Describe your internal thought process and the specific, subtle actions you would take over the next 48 hours before escalating to a formal meeting.\n\r\n\n\r\n3) Leadership Challenge & Dialogue: One of your VAs is a talented writer who is fantastic at executing assigned tasks, but they rarely contribute original ideas in team brainstorming sessions. Your goal is to help them develop the confidence to become a more proactive contributor. What are the first three open-ended questions you would ask them in a private check-in to understand their perspective before you offer any advice?\n\r\n\n\r\n4) Creative Solution: If you had a 'magic wand' to instantly create one new tool, system, or a specific team ritual that doesn't exist yet, what would you create to solve the single biggest challenge you believe? Give it a name and explain how it would specifically foster both productivity and well-being.\n\r\n\n\r\n5) Preferred Tool Stack: What are your go-to tools for project management, task tracking, and team communication? Please mention why you prefer them.\n\r\n\n\r\n6) AI in Your Workflow: Explain where and how you use AI to improve your productivity, and where you deliberately choose not to rely on AI in a team management context. (Wish you aren't using AI for answering these questions, because they will be further discussed in the interview later.)\n\r\n\n\r\n7) Available Hours: Let us know your general availability (e.g., \"Approximately 20 hours per week, mostly flexible between 1PM - 8PM on Monday, 3 PM - 10PM on Tuesday, 12PM - 8PM on Wednesday, ...,  in Philippines time\").\n\r\n\n\r\n8) Available Period of Work: Let us know for how long you expect to work with us. We'd prefer at least 6 months with opportunities for extension.\n\r\n\n\r\n9) Willingness for Zoo\netings: Confirm that you're willing to participate in occasional Zoo\netings for team alignment and check-ins.\n\r\n\n\r\nI will respond to your application in 7-15 days all at once.\n\r\nWe look forward to hearing from you.

We are looking for a professional who takes pride in the quality and integrity of their work.\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, only read further if you’re passionate about deep investigative research, are comfortable spending significant time validating sources, and believe in forming well-reasoned conclusions based on evidence rather than shortcuts.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Job Title]\n\r\nInvestigative Research VA (Due Diligence & Partner Vetting)\n\r\n\n\r\n[Work Type]\n\r\nRemote | Flexible Hours | Long-term Contract\n\r\n\n\r\n[Base Payment]\n\r\nWe offer a project-based compensation structure for those who apply as part-time. That said, the expected monthly range is USD $500–$1,000(for full-time workers), depending on factors such as proficiency, workload, task complexity, performance (including bonuses), experience, skill set, and the final scope of responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Bonus]\n\r\nThere's potential for a performance-based bonus tied to the quality, depth, and actionable impact of your analysis. This could be triggered by identifying a critical red flag that prevents a poor partnership or uncovering an insight that leads to a significant business advantage. We'll go over those details once you've demonstrated your skills, but you should be comfortable working with just the base pay initially.\n\r\n\n\r\n[What You’ll Be Doing]\n\r\n\n\r\nYour role is to be our intelligence frontline, conducting comprehensive investigations to determine if potential partner companies are legitimate, ethical, and trustworthy. Your main tasks will include:\n\r\n\n\r\na) Deep Media & Public Record Analysis: Go beyond surface-level news to uncover a company’s true public standing. This includes distinguishing genuine earned media from paid propaganda and verifying complex corporate structures, including parent companies, shell companies, and any history of name changes.\n\r\n\n\r\nb) Digital Footprint & Online Presence Assessment: Dissect a company's complete online presence. You will analyze their website and SEO history to understand their strategic narrative and dig deep into forums, niche blogs, and comment sections to find candid, non-obvious online mentions.\n\r\n\n\r\nc) Social Network & Engagement Audit: Evaluate the authenticity of a company’s online community. You will assess the quality of engagement (not just the quantity) to identify bot activity and evaluate how the company professionally and transparently handles critical questions or negative feedback.\n\r\n\n\r\nd) Thorough Vetting of Key Personnel: A company is only as reputable as its leaders. You will cross-reference the professional histories of key executives, looking for inconsistencies, unexplained career gaps, or past associations with fraudulent or failed enterprises.\n\r\n\n\r\ne) Customer & Client Feedback Analysis: Synthesize the true customer experience. This involves identifying recurring patterns in negative reviews that could signal systemic issues and validating the authenticity of positive reviews to screen for purchased or incentivized testimonials.\n\r\n\n\r\nf) Direct Company Engagement (The Human Test): You will directly\n and call target companies with provided questions to gauge their operational integrity. You’ll analyze their response times, professionalism, transparency, and overall willingness to engage in good faith.\n\r\n\n\r\ng) Synthesis & Evidence-Based Reporting: Your final and most critical task is to transform raw data into actionable intelligence. You will deliver a clear, concise report where every conclusion is backed by cited evidence and provide a definitive recommendation on whether to proceed with a partnership.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Goal]\n\r\nThe ultimate goal is to protect our business by providing the clear, fact-based, and trustworthy assessments we need to make sound partnership decisions. By conducting diligent, uncompromising research, you will ensure we only align with legitimate and ethical partners, safeguarding our reputation and resources.\n\r\n\n\r\n[What We’re Looking For]\n\r\nThe ideal candidate:\n\r\n\n\r\na) Has a Proven Track Record in Investigative Research: You have direct experience in roles requiring deep investigation, such as journalism, academia, paralegal work, or market research. You have a portfolio of past research reports that you can share.\n\r\n\n\r\nb) Possesses a High Degree of Skepticism & Analytical Rigor: You are naturally inquisitive and question everything. You excel at identifying inconsistencies, weighing conflicting sources, and distinguishing between correlation and causation.\n\r\n\n\r\nc) Is a Clear and Nuanced Communicator: You are meticulous and precise in your written communication. You are comfortable using nuanced language (\"evidence suggests,\" \"high degree of confidence\") rather than making absolute claims you cannot prove.\n\r\n\n\r\nd) Is a Master of Digital Research Tools: You are highly proficient with advanced search engine operators, social media analysis tools, website archive tools (e.g., Wayback Machine), and methods for searching public records.\n\r\n\n\r\ne) Demonstrates Exceptional Human Judgment: You understand that not all data is equal and can apply common sense and critical thinking to interpret the subtleties of human behavior online and in direct communication.\n\r\n\n\r\nf) Communicates with Clarity and Values Respect: You are reliable, accountable, and can articulate your thoughts in a clear, logical manner.\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant Note:\n\r\nWe value respectful communication. What does it mean? Most importantly, if you need to step away, just let us know why and when. We understand it, even if you need to leave tomorrow, BUT ghosting is the last thing you'd like to do, since it causes confusion and delays. In everyday conversations, our team thrives on mutual respect, no matter your role.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Why Work With Us?]\n\r\n\n\r\nFlexible hours to suit your lifestyle.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe opportunity to play a critical role in our strategic decision-making process.\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-term growth opportunities as our company scales.\n\r\n\n\r\nA supportive environment where your diligence, intellect, and analytical skills are highly valued.\n\r\n\n\r\n[About Us]\n\r\nWe are a growing team dedicated to achieving our goals through smart strategy and diligent execution. We believe that our success is built on a foundation of sound, data-driven decisions and that vetting our partners with the utmost care is essential. Your role is absolutely critical to upholding this standard.\n\r\n\n\r\n[How to Apply]\n\r\nSubject Line: Start your title with \"Investigative Researcher\", or your application cannot be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application, include:\n\r\n\n\r\n1) Work History / Portfolio: Share your resume and, more importantly, 1-2 examples of past research reports that showcase your analytical and reporting skills.\n\r\n\n\r\n2) Research Open-end Scenario: Imagine you are investigating a private company with a very limited digital footprint and have hit a wall with standard search methods. Walk me through how you would approach the research process, preferably in 3-5 steps. This is open-ended question. Explain the strategic reason for your specific sequence. \n\r\n\n\r\n3) Source Credibility Challenge: You uncover two pieces of information about a potential partner. The first is a glowing, sponsored article on a well-known business blog. The second is an anonymous but highly detailed negative review from a former employee on a niche industry forum. How do you weigh these two sources in your final report, and what are your next steps?\n\r\n\n\r\n4) Preferred Tool Stack: What are your go-to tools for deep research beyond a standard Google search? Please mention specific tools for website analysis, social media investigation, or public record searches and why you prefer them.\n\r\n\n\r\n5) AI in Your Workflow: Explain where and how you use AI to assist in your research process and, critically, where you believe relying on AI is a liability that compromises research integrity. (We hope you aren't using AI to answer these questions, as we will discuss them in detail during the interview.)\n\r\n\n\r\n6) Available Hours: Let us know your general availability (e.g., \"Approximately 20 hours per week, mostly flexible between 9 AM - 5 PM EST\").\n\r\n\n\r\n7) Available Period of Work: Let us know for how long you expect to work with us. We'd prefer at least 6 months with opportunities for extension.\n\r\n\n\r\n8) Willingness for Zoo\netings: Confirm that you're willing to participate in occasional Zoo\netings for briefing and reporting.\n\r\n\n\r\nI will respond to all applications within 7-15 days.\n\r\nWe look forward to hearing from you.

    "description": "\n                    Howdy y'all!  We are New York based marketing agency that is looking for assistance with graphic design specifically pertaining to pre-press and printing.  If you believe you qualify, you must review all the requirements below.  If you do not have specific experience in pre-press and printing, it is not likely you should apply for this position, so please read the post completely and thoroughly, and, respond accordingly.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe currently work with Adobe InDesign but are willing consider a move to Canva Pro.  We currently use Adobe Creative Suite, but you would need to provide your own Canva Pro account.  We like Canva Pro but haven't yet fully committed to it.  Therefore, our work is initially in Adobe InDesign (which is the standard still for American pre-press work).\n\r\n\n\r\nHere are the requirements to apply; when you respond to this post, just please make it very clear that you can meet each requirement:\n\r\n\n\r\n*  Robust experience using either Adobe Creative Suite or Canva Pro.  (Note: having only an unlicensed version of Canva would be insufficient for this position).\n\r\n\n\r\n*  Depth of commercially produced and commercially viable pre-press and printed work; such designs would be for printed postcards, or brochures, or magazines, or envelopes, or letterhead, or annual reports, or similar.  In other words, you must be able to demonstrate that you have significant pre-press experience.\n\r\n\n\r\n*  Online portfolio (such as \n) that would be easy for us to review your past efforts. Unfortunately, we will not comb through anyone's online digital image repositories to glean design talents and abilities (e.g. we will not be going through images on GoogleDrive, Dropbox, etc.).\n\r\n\n\r\n*  Abidance of pre-press \"best practices\" in graphic design.  Examples of standard pre-press best practices are:  use of layers (images/text) in InDesign, version control, packaged subfolders (InDesign), proper use of white space (and reverse white space), knowledge of design effects, controlled use of fonts that are either common or packaged with your design, and perhaps most of all, crops-for-bleeds (crop marks). [Note: if you are not familiar with these terms, it is not likely that this position is for you.]\n\r\n\n\r\n*  Availability such that your hours coi\n with our hours here in New York (New York time = GMT-5 or Eastern Standard Time [EST]).  It is not necessary that you work an overnight, but you will need to have overlap at least our time zone for a minimum of 3 hours.  Further, you must be available to respond within 12 hours if we need assistance.  While it is, of course, unreasonable that your availability would be \"on demand\", we nonetheless must establish some sort of minimum and agreed upon response time protocols.\n\r\n\n\r\n*  Consciousness that the design work for our clients is time sensitive and budget sensitive.  Example: on the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, one side of a 5 1/2\" x 8 1/2\" postcard would take no more than one (1) hour; working on a two-sided card would therefore take no more than one and a half (1.5) to two (2) hours.  The turn-around would need to be within 24 hours.  We would pay by the hour.  \n\r\n\n\r\nGood news:  we can train for U.S. Postal Service regulations regarding physical mailpiece standards and layout out.  Further, we also know that you cannot read minds so our job ticket descriptions are usually very detailed.  However, we are unable to train for carefulness of effort and awareness of reading job tickets properly.  Once completed, your files would be re-uploaded to our cloud server or otherwise accessible to us online to our digital network.  Finally, your use of the English language would need to be solid and there is an expectation that your attitude would be positive and of good cheer.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen you apply, please (a) respond here and (b) also send an\n to \n wherein your will state \"Hey HR Manager, I really read the WHOLE post!\".  In this way, we'll know that - yes, you guessed it - actually read the whole post.  Questions?  First, respond positive to the requirements above, and then we are happy to answer any questions!\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you!                ",

We chased money, sold products we didn’t believe in, and eventually realized we hated what we were building. So we scrapped everything and kept only one thing: Cuban Links - the only product our customers truly loved.\n\r\n\n\r\nOver the last 12 months, we’ve rebuilt BALANZI from the ground up: redesigned products, raised our quality standards, refined our positioning, and committed fully to becoming the #1 destination for Cuban Links.\n\r\n\n\r\nToday, we’re a small, passionate team focused on excellence, long-term thinking, and building a brand we’re truly proud of; never compromising on product, customer experience, or our team.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Work For BALANZI? \n\r\n\n\r\n- Your work has real impact, and it will directly shape BALANZI and its future\n\r\n- You work directly with the founders, not buried under layers of management\n\r\n- You’ll have real ownership, autonomy, and the ability to move the needle fast\n\r\n- You’ll grow faster here than in any traditional environment \n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll join a team with high standards, no bureaucracy, and a clear mission we believe in\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this gets you fired up, then click below and apply now.

DAY SHIFT = LIFE-CHANGING\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're working night shift now:\n\r\n- Your health is suffering\n\r\n- You're missing your family\n\r\n- You know this isn't sustainable\n\r\n\n\r\n**We're offering the same work at normal hours. Sleep at night. Live your life.**\n\r\n\n\r\n### 2. DIRECT CEO RELATIONSHIP\n\r\n\n\r\nNot one of 300 VAs at outsourcing company. You work directly with Scott (CEO). He knows your name, sees your impact, hears your ideas.\n\r\n\n\r\n### 3. OWNERSHIP, NOT TASK EXECUTION\n\r\n\n\r\nYou won't just \"do what you're told.\" You'll **own the automation infrastructure** and make it excellent. See problems, fix them. Spot opportunities, implement them.\n\r\n\n\r\n### 4. REAL CAREER GROWTH\n\r\n\n\r\nClear path from $7/hour ? $12/hour over 3-5 years. Potential to manage other VAs. This is a 5-10 year career, not an 18-month gig.\n\r\n\n\r\n### 5. MEASURABLE IMPACT\n\r\n\n\r\nYour automations directly generate clients and revenue. You'll see concrete results: \"Your workflow captured $50K in new business this quarter.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## HOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\n*\n:** \n\r\n\n\r\n**Subject Line:** \"Tech Automation - [Your Name] - [Years Exp] - [Current Situation]\"\n\r\n\n\r\nExample: *\"Tech Automation - Maria Santos - 5 Years - LAVA Employee Seeking Day Shift\"*\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n### INCLUDE IN YOUR APPLICATION:\n\r\n\n\r\n**1.

Flexible hours but must overlap with Eastern Standard Time (EST) for at least 3–4 hours daily.\n\r\nAbout Us\n\r\nWindsor Drake is a mergers & acquisitions (M&A) advisory firm based in Canada. We help founders of established businesses ($1M–$20M+ in revenue) sell their companies to qualified buyers. We are building a high-volume outbound sales machine and need someone exceptional to own our lead research and list building operations.\n\r\nThis is not a generic VA role. You will be the engine behind a 4-person outbound sales team. The quality of the lists you build directly determines whether our team books meetings or wastes their day calling the wrong people. If you're great at this, you'll have a massive impact on a fast-growing company.\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\nYour core job is to build hyper-targeted, enriched lead lists of Canadian business owners and potential buyers using Clay, Apollo, and other research tools.\n\r\nSpecifically:\n\r\n\n\r\nBuild and maintain lead lists in Clay and Apollo targeting Canadian founders and business owners in specific sectors (manufacturing, HVAC, construction, healthcare services, tech, professional services, etc.)\n\r\nEnrich every lead with: verified direct\n, direct cell phone number, LinkedIn profile URL, company revenue estimate, employee count, years in business, founder tenure, business sector/industry\n\r\nCross-reference and verify data using LinkedIn Sales Navigator, company websites, government business registries, and other online sources\n\r\nSegment and tag lists by geography (province/city), industry, revenue range, employee count, and founder characteristics\n\r\nClean and deduplicate data before importing to HubSpot CRM\n\r\nContinuously test new data sources, Clay enrichment workflows, and Apollo search filters to improve list quality and hit rate\n\r\nTrack list performance metrics (which lists lead to the most booked meetings) and optimize accordingly\n\r\nResearch and identify potential buyer leads (private equity firms, strategic acquirers, family offices, search funds) targeting Canadian businesses\n\r\n\n\r\nTools You Must Know\n\r\nRequired — must have hands-on experience with:\n\r\n\n\r\nClay (building tables, enrichment workflows, waterfall enrichment, AI prompts within Clay, integrations)\n\r\n\n (advanced search filters, saved searches, list building, data export, sequence setup)\n\r\nLinkedIn Sales Navigator (boolean search, lead lists, account lists)\n\r\nHubSpot CRM (importing contacts, list management, custom properties, basic workflows)\n\r\nGoogle Sheets / Excel (data cleaning, deduplication, VLOOKUP, formatting for CRM import)\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to have:\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with other enrichment tools (ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Lusha, RocketReach, BuiltWith, Crunchbase)\n\r\nFamiliarity with Canadian business databases (Industry Canada, provincial business registries)\n\r\nExperience supporting outbound sales teams or SDR/BDR teams\n\r\nUnderstanding of the M&A industry or business brokerage\n\r\nZapier or \n for automating data flows\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are obsessed with data quality. You'd rather spend an extra 30 minutes verifying 50 leads than hand over a list with bad phone numbers and wrong\ns. You take pride in clean, accurate data.\n\r\nYou are resourceful and creative. When Apollo doesn't have a phone number, you don't stop — you check Clay enrichment, LinkedIn, the company website, Canada411, provincial registries, whatever it takes to find it.\n\r\nYou are organized and systematic. You build repeatable processes, not one-off lists. You document your workflows so they can scale.\n\r\nYou can work independently. We'll give you targeting criteria and you'll go build the lists without needing to be micromanaged.\n\r\nYou communicate clearly. If a list isn't coming together well or you're hitting dead ends in a sector, you tell us proactively — not after wasting 3 days.\n\r\nYou understand that your work directly impacts revenue. When you deliver a great list, our team books meetings. When the list is bad, they waste their day. You take that seriously.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\r\nWithin your first 30 days:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou've built Clay workflows for our top 3 target sectors\n\r\nYou've delivered your first 500+ enriched, verified leads to HubSpot\n\r\nOur outbound team is calling your lists and booking meetings\n\r\n\n\r\nWithin 90 days:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou've built a repeatable system for producing 1,000+ new enriched leads per month across multiple sectors and geographies\n\r\nYou're tracking which list segments convert best and proactively recommending where to focus\n\r\nYou've identified and tested at least 2–3 new data sources or enrichment methods beyond Apollo and Clay\n\r\nOur team never runs out of people to call\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nDo NOT send a generic application. We will ignore it.\n\r\nInstead, send us a short Loom video (3–5 minutes max) where you:\n\r\n\n\r\nShow us a Clay table you've built for a previous client or project — walk us through the enrichment workflow you set up, what data sources you used, and why\n\r\nShow us an Apollo search you've built — explain the filters you chose and how you'd refine it for targeting Canadian business owners with $2M–$10M in revenue\n\r\nTell us one thing most people get wrong about lead list building and what you do differently\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you don't have Clay experience but are very strong in Apollo + LinkedIn Sales Navigator and are confident you can learn Clay quickly, still apply — but be honest about it in your video.\n\r\nApplications without a Loom video will not be reviewed.\n\r\nWhy This Role Is Different\n\r\nThis isn't data entry. This isn't scraping random\ns. You'll be the person who determines which Canadian founders our team talks to every single day. The data you build becomes a long-term strategic asset for our company. You'll work directly with the founder (not through 3 layers of management), get real feedback on how your lists perform, and have a clear line of sight between your work and the company's growth.\n\r\nIf you're the kind of person who gets excited about building the perfect lead list and seeing it convert into real business, we want to talk to you.

    "description": "\n                    We are seeking a visionary architect of the digital age—someone whose imagination outpaces the tools they use. You don't just execute on a brief; you expand it, bringing a rare blend of creative intuition and conceptual depth to every frame\n\r\n\n\r\nWe can start you as part-time, then transition to a full-time role in our growing Company. \n\r\n\n\r\n1. Next-Gen Visual Production\n\r\nHyper-Realistic Mastery: Elevate AI beyond the uncanny valley. You’ll craft product imagery so crisp and textured it rivals $50k studio shoots, with an obsessive eye for light physics and material depth.\n\r\n\n\r\nCinematic Motion: Defy the \"AI look.\" Using Veo 3.1, you’ll produce organic, human-centric video—from high-fashion lifestyle spots to high-converting UGC—where every frame feels intentional and cinematic.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Power Stack: Command a sophisticated workflow centered on Nano Banana Pro, pushing the limits of the model to squeeze out every drop of fidelity and realism.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Brand Logic & Aesthetic Continuity\n\r\nThe Style Chameleon: Master the art of the \"visual echo.\" You can reverse-engineer any aesthetic—be it moody noir or airy luxury—and replicate it with 100% precision across entire campaigns.\n\r\n\n\r\nLuxury Stewardship: Act as the ultimate gatekeeper of brand DNA. You ensure every pixel breathes \"premium,\" maintaining a seamless visual flow that builds deep consumer trust.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Art Direction: You aren't just a prompt engineer; you’re a digital auteur. You apply high-level art direction to ensure AI outputs meet the rigorous standards of global luxury brands.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Viral Innovation & UGC Strategy\n\r\nConcept to Conversion: Transform raw ideas into scroll-stopping visual narratives. You don’t just \"make content\"; you build visual experiences that align with strategic business goals.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe UGC Edge: Bridge the gap between \"polished\" and \"authentic.\" You’ll engineer high-performing UGC that feels raw and relatable but remains sophisticated enough for a premium brand’s feed.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Elite Post-Production & Scalability\n\r\nThe Final Polish: Use a master’s touch in post-production to scrub away artifacts and add that final 5% of \"magic\" that makes AI content indistinguishable from reality.\n\r\n\n\r\nFuture-Proof Workflows: Design the blueprints for scale. You’ll build repeatable, high-velocity pipelines that maintain rigorous quality control without sacrificing creative soul.\n\r\n                ",

You learn strategy by doing the work, spotting patterns, and understanding what actually performs, not by sitting on the sidelines.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you consistently execute with speed, attention to detail, and sound judgment, this role is the foundation for growing into a \n\r\nCreative Strategist position.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho This Is Really For\n\r\n\n\r\n- You thrive in high standards\n\r\n- You take REAL ownership \n\r\n- You learn fast and figure things out\n\r\n- You perform best when the stakes are real \n\r\n- You care about building something meaningful \n\r\n- You’re willing to get your hands dirty to move the mission forward\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Core Values\n\r\n\n\r\nThe right person for this role will connect deeply with our values, live them daily, and understand why they’re essential for building something great.\n\r\n\n\r\n1. No Compromises – You never compromise on anything, from product to customer experience.\n\r\n2. Ultimate Perseverance – You don’t stop. The challenge doesn’t matter; there’s always a solution to a problem. \n\r\n3. Extreme Ownership – You take full ownership. You care about the details and deliver work you’re proud to put your name on.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf these values don’t feel like a natural fit, please do not apply. \n\r\n\n\r\nMain Responsibilities: \n\r\n\n\r\n- Own the full intake, review, and breakdown of all raw creative assets across customers, creators, partners, and internal shoots, ensuring no footage is wasted \n\r\n\n\r\n- Break down every raw file into deployable components including hooks, talking heads, B-roll, and standalone raw ads, with full timestamping and context tagging \n\r\n\n\r\n- Maintain and update shared B-roll, hooks, and talking-head banks, ensuring assets are categorized by format, intent, tone, and use case \n\r\n\n\r\n- Assign the best-fit assets to scripts and angles provided by the Creative Strategist, flagging gaps where new footage is required \n\r\n\n\r\n- Act as the single point of contact for editors by preparing precise editor requests with timestamps, clip order, notes, and clear do/don’t rules \n\r\n\n\r\n- Manage first-pass quality control on all edited assets, blocking anything that creates doubt, feels salesy, or breaks BALANZI’s calm, confident tone \n\r\n\n\r\n- Organize and maintain a clean creative asset library so footage is reusable across ads, cutdowns, and future campaigns without reshoots \n\r\n\n\r\n- Ensure editors are never blocked, creative velocity stays high, and strategy can be executed without friction or delays \n\r\n\n\r\n- Offload execution-heavy creative work from the founders and strategist so they can focus on direction, growth, and decision-making  \n\r\n\n\r\nPrior Experience / Skills\n\r\n\n\r\n- No experience required\n\r\n- We're hiring for potential, not experience\n\r\n- Your performance during the trial is all that matters\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us \n\r\n\n\r\nBALANZI exists to build the world’s best Cuban Link chain for everyday life - so that men can move through life feeling confident, without ever needing to take off their chain or change who they are.\n\r\n\n\r\nFounded in 2020, we didn’t start with a big mission. We chased money, sold products we didn’t believe in, and eventually realized we hated what we were building. So we scrapped everything and kept only one thing: Cuban Links - the only product our customers truly loved.\n\r\n\n\r\nOver the last 12 months, we’ve rebuilt BALANZI from the ground up: redesigned products, raised our quality standards, refined our positioning, and committed fully to becoming the #1 destination for Cuban Links.\n\r\n\n\r\nToday, we’re a small, passionate team focused on excellence, long-term thinking, and building a brand we’re truly proud of; never compromising on product, customer experience, or our team.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Work For BALANZI? \n\r\n\n\r\n- Your work has real impact, and it will directly shape BALANZI and its future\n\r\n- You work directly with the founders, not buried under layers of management\n\r\n- You’ll have real ownership, autonomy, and the ability to move the needle fast\n\r\n- You’ll grow faster here than in any traditional environment \n\r\n- You’ll join a team with high standards, no bureaucracy, and a clear mission we believe in\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this gets you fired up, then click below and apply now.

    "description": "\n                    ABOUT US\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a US-based commerce company, the American arm of an established European e-commerce and trading group operating across 29 countries with 650,000+ products across multiple brands in construction, home improvement, sustainability, and premium bath & kitchen.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are also a US distributor of a European contactless QR-payment solution for churches, nonprofits, and venues.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur motto: \"Do it with Passion or don't do it at all.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are building a Commerce 4.0 infrastructure with AI-driven automation, and we need a sharp, resourceful person to become the CEO's digital right hand.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTHIS IS NOT A TYPICAL VA ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who thinks like an entrepreneur, not just an assistant. You will co-build operations across the USA and Southeast Asia, manage teams, drive sales, and grow with us into a leadership position. If you want to be part of building something big - this is your opportunity.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR ROLE - SIX KEY AREAS\n\r\n\n\r\n1. US FINTECH PRODUCT - Sales & Distribution Support\n\r\nWe distribute a European contactless QR-payment solution for churches, zoos, museums, and nonprofits in the US market. We're building the sales infrastructure from scratch - so tell us what tools you've worked with and we'll set it up together.\n\r\n- Build and maintain lead lists (churches, zoos, museums, nonprofits across the US)\n\r\n- Set up and manage a CRM pipeline from zero (you recommend the tool, we d\n together)\n\r\n- Coordinate\n campaigns and follow-ups with our US Managing Partner\n\r\n- Prepare sales materials, proposals, and demo scheduling\n\r\n- Research target markets and verticals\n\r\nAs this grows, you'll hire sales support and manage them - so you need to understand the full sales cycle yourself first.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. VIETNAM & SOUTHEAST ASIA - Team Building\n\r\nWe are building a remote operations team in Southeast Asia (Vietnam and Philippines). You will help recruit, onboard, and coordinate.\n\r\n- Post job openings on local platforms (VietnamWorks, TopCV, TopDev, OnlineJobs.ph)\n\r\n- Screen candidates, conduct initial interviews, coordinate with CEO for final decisions\n\r\n- Set up daily standups, reporting, and project tracking (Slack, Notion, GitHub)\n\r\n- Act as the bridge between Austrian HQ and the Southeast Asian team\n\r\n- Help evaluate EOR providers and manage contractor compliance\n\r\nYou'll eventually hand off daily coordination to a local team lead - but first you need to build the processes and understand what good looks like.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. E-COMMERCE BACKOFFICE & OPERATIONS\n\r\nOur European parent company operates multiple brands and marketplaces (Amazon, eBay, ManoMano, own webshops). A core priority from Day 1 is launching (or relaunching) our US marketplace channels - Amazon USA, eBay USA, and later Walmart.\n\r\n- Build, optimize, and launch product listings on Amazon, eBay, and Walmart US\n\r\n- Develop pricing strategies, fulfillment setup (FBA/FBM), and shipping logistics for the US market\n\r\n- Marketplace ticket management and customer communication\n\r\n- Order processing, supplier coordination, shipping tracking\n\r\n- EPR compliance tracking across European jurisdictions\n\r\n- Product data management and listing optimization\n\r\nOnce the channels run smoothly, you'll hire dedicated marketplace managers - but you need to have done it yourself to know what \"smooth\" looks like.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. AUTOMATION & DIGITAL TOOLS\n\r\nWe automate everything we can. You should be comfortable with modern tools.\n\r\n- Help build and maintain workflows in n8n (our automation platform)\n\r\n- Create reports, dashboards, and data summaries\n\r\n- Manage content calendars for LinkedIn and social media\n\r\n- Use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) productively for content, research, and analysis\n\r\n- Document processes and create SOPs for repeatable tasks\n\r\n\n\r\n5. FINANCE & ACCOUNTING\n\r\nYou take ownership of the financial back office and make sure everything is clean, organized, and transparent.\n\r\n- Restructure and maintain the bookkeeping system across multiple entities (US and Europe)\n\r\n- Prepare and track invoices, credit notes, and payment reminders\n\r\n- Monitor incoming and outgoing payments, reconcile bank accounts\n\r\n- Coordinate with the external accountant and tax advisor (monthly closings, VAT filings, annual statements)\n\r\n- Prepare financial summaries and reports for the CEO\n\r\n- Track expenses, budgets, and profitability per channel and brand\n\r\n- Ensure compliance with local tax requirements across jurisdictions\n\r\n\n\r\n6. DIGITAL MARKETING & SOCIAL COMMERCE\n\r\nModern e-commerce doesn't work without strong digital presence. You'll build and manage our marketing channels.\n\r\n- LinkedIn content strategy and posting (for the CEO and company profiles)\n\r\n- TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube for product marketing and brand building\n\r\n- AI-generated content creation (using tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney for posts, videos, and ads)\n\r\n- Influencer marketing and AI influencer strategies\n\r\n-\n and Instagram Shopping integration\n\r\n-\n marketing and newsletter campaigns\n\r\n- SEO basics and performance tracking\n\r\n- Paid ads coordination (Google Ads, Meta Ads - working with specialists)\n\r\nYou don't need to be a full-time content creator - but you need to understand what works, set the strategy, and eventually hire specialists (content creators, video editors, ad managers) that you can properly manage and evaluate.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO YOU ARE\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Personality:\n\r\nYou are the kind of person who opens their laptop in the morning and already knows what needs to happen today - without being told. You learn new tools over a weekend, not in a training program. When something breaks, you don't wait for instructions - you find a fix, implement it, and then report what you did. You thrive in fast-paced environments where no two days look the same.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're comfortable making decisions on your own in day-to-day operations (backoffice, tickets, scheduling), but you also know when to check in with the CEO on strategic calls (hiring decisions, client communication, new processes). You're not looking for a 9-to-5 routine - you want to build something and grow with it.\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT: THE COORDINATOR MINDSET\n\r\n\n\r\nLet's be clear about what this role really is. We don't expect you to be a world-class expert in every single area listed below. What we DO expect is that you've done enough of it yourself to truly understand how it works - the pain points, the shortcuts, the quality standards. Why? Because your real job is to build a team around you that handles the specialist work, and you need to be able to tell the difference between great work and garbage. You can only control what you understand. If you've never run an ad campaign, you can't evaluate someone who does it for you. If you've never reconciled a bank account, you won't catch mistakes. We need someone who has been in the trenches, understands the work, and can then hire, train, and manage the people who do it day-to-day. You don't need to be the best at everything - but you need to have done everything at least once.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Skills That Matter Most:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Fast Learner & Tech-Native (Most Important)\n\r\nThis is non-negotiable. Our stack changes, our tools evolve, and we move fast. You pick up a new platform in hours, not weeks. If someone shows you n8n or a new CRM, you're productive within days.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. High Capacity & Multitasking Under Pressure\n\r\nYou'll manage sales leads in the morning, screen a developer candidate in Southeast Asia before lunch, handle marketplace tickets in the afternoon, and prepare a report for the CEO by evening. You need to context-switch cleanly and keep quality high across all areas.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Professional Communication\n\r\nYou write\ns that clients and partners take seriously. Your English is flawless - not just grammatically correct, but professional, clear, and appropriate for business contexts in the US and Europe.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Initiative & Problem-Solving\n\r\nWhen you see a gap, you flag it - or better, you close it. You don't wait to be micromanaged. You suggest improvements, find better ways to do things, and take ownership of outcomes, not just tasks.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHARD SKILLS BY AREA\n\r\n\n\r\nUS Fintech Product / Sales Support:\n\r\n- CRM setup and management (tell us what you've used - we're building from scratch together) - Required\n\r\n-\n campaign setup and coordination - Required\n\r\n- Lead research and list building - Required\n\r\n- Sales material preparation (decks, proposals) - Nice to have\n\r\n- Understanding of payment processing / fintech - Nice to have\n\r\n\n\r\nSoutheast Asia Team Building:\n\r\n- Experience posting jobs and screening candidates (Upwork, OnlineJobs.ph, VietnamWorks) - Required\n\r\n- Remote team coordination (Slack, Notion, daily standups) - Required\n\r\n- Experience managing or leading a remote team of 3+ people - Strongly preferred\n\r\n- Knowledge of EOR/contractor compliance in Southeast Asia - Nice to have\n\r\n\n\r\nE-Commerce Backoffice:\n\r\n- Marketplace operations (Amazon Seller Central, eBay) - Required\n\r\n- Experience launching or building marketplace channels from scratch - Strongly preferred\n\r\n- Fulfillment knowledge (FBA, FBM, 3PL) - Strongly preferred\n\r\n- Order management and customer service - Required\n\r\n- Product data management and listing optimization - Nice to have\n\r\n\n\r\nAutomation & Digital Tools:\n\r\n- Google Workspace power user (Sheets, Docs, Drive) - Required\n\r\n- Experience with at least one automation tool (n8n, Zapier, Make) - Strongly preferred\n\r\n- Comfortable using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) for content and automation - Required\n\r\n- Marketing automation \n sequences, social scheduling) - Nice to have\n\r\n\n\r\nDigital Marketing & Social Commerce:\n\r\n- Experience managing social media accounts (LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube) - Required\n\r\n- Content creation or coordination (posts, short videos, newsletters) - Required\n\r\n- Understanding of AI content tools (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Canva AI, etc.) - Strongly preferred\n\r\n- Paid ads experience (Google Ads, Meta Ads) - Nice to have, can hire specialists\n\r\n- SEO basics and analytics (Google Analytics, Search Console) - Nice to have\n\r\n- Influencer outreach or partnership management - Nice to have\n\r\n\n\r\nFinance & Accounting:\n\r\n- Bookkeeping experience (invoicing, payment tracking, bank reconciliation) - Required\n\r\n- Experience coordinating with external accountants / tax advisors - Required\n\r\n- Understanding of multi-entity or multi-country financial structures - Strongly preferred\n\r\n- Proficiency in Excel/Google Sheets for financial reporting - Required\n\r\n- Knowledge of US and/or European VAT/sales tax basics - Nice to have\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR IDEAL BACKGROUND\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're the right person if you come from one of these paths:\n\r\n- Senior VA / Executive Assistant who managed operations for an e-commerce founder and is ready for a leadership role\n\r\n- E-commerce Operations Manager from a marketplace seller or D2C brand\n\r\n- BPO Team Lead / Project Manager who coordinated multiple clients or workstreams\n\r\n- Startup Operations Generalist who wore many hats and loved it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n- Excellent English (written and spoken) - C1/C2 level\n\r\n- 3+ years of relevant professional experience\n\r\n- Available for 4+ hours daily overlap with Central European Time (CET / UTC+1)\n\r\n- Reliable high-speed internet and professional home office setup\n\r\n- Based in the Philippines or Vietnam\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR GROWTH PATH\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 1 - Build the Foundation (Month 1-3)\n\r\nYou and the CEO launch (or relaunch) the US marketplace channels: Amazon USA and eBay USA go live with optimized listings, pricing, and fulfillment. A major priority in this phase is restructuring the entire bookkeeping and financial operations: cleaning up accounts, establishing clear processes for invoicing, payment tracking, and reporting, and setting up a reliable monthly closing workflow with the external accountant. By the end of month 3, the US channels are generating revenue and the financial back office is fully organized and transparent.\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 2 - Delegate & Expand (Month 3-6)\n\r\nWith the core channels running, you hire one or more tea\nmbers to take over daily marketplace operations and customer service.

You and the CEO begin building automation workflows together using AI tools and a dedicated developer.\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 3 - Launch, Hand Off, Repeat (Month 6-12)\n\r\nYou operate on a 2-month launch cycle: identify a new project, build it, stabilize it, hand it off to your growing team, and move to the next one. You oversee all tea\nmbers, ensure quality, and keep the machine running while pushing into new territory. The company begins offering its proven launch and operations expertise as a service to other brands.\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 4 - Leadership (Year 2+)\n\r\nYou've built a team, launched multiple projects, and proven you can run operations independently. The conversation shifts to COO, Country Manager, or equity participation.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\r\n- Competitive base salary (discussed during interview)\n\r\n- Performance-based bonus structure tied to company revenue and project success\n\r\n- Clear growth path from Operations Manager to leadership (COO / Country Manager)\n\r\n- Direct access to the CEO - no middle management, no bureaucracy\n\r\n- The opportunity to build something real from the ground up\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nSend us:\n\r\n1. Your CV/Resume (English)\n\r\n2. A short cover letter (max 1 page): Why this role? What's your superpower?\n\r\n3. Links to relevant work: LinkedIn profile, portfolio, or references\n\r\n4.

Soft wind. The female mage walks alone, speaking as if remembering someone important.]\n\r\n\n\r\nI’ve walked this path more times than I can count… but it still feels different every time. The trees change, the wind shifts, even the scent of the air reminds me of how long it’s been. Mortals live their lives so quickly… and yet, somehow, their memories stay with me longer than they ever stayed in this world.\n\r\n\n\r\n(soft laugh, bittersweet)\n\r\nFunny, isn’t it? I used to think time was something endless—something only I had to worry about. But now… now I finally understand why they cherished every sunrise. Every conversation. Every simple \nnt.\n\r\n\n\r\n(pauses, voice softening)\n\r\nI can still hear them. Their footsteps, their laughter, the way they argued over the smallest things. I thought those days would last forever. But forever… was only a blink for them.\n\r\n\n\r\n(more emotional, gentle)\n\r\nI wish I had said it earlier. “Thank you.” “Don’t leave so quickly.” “Stay just a little longer.” But I said nothing. I thought there would always be another day… another road to walk together. I was wrong.\n\r\n\n\r\n(looks up at the sky)\n\r\nBut even now, even after all these years… I’m still searching. Not for them—no. Their journey is long over. I’m searching for the meaning behind the time we shared. For the reason their short lives touched mine so deeply.\n\r\n\n\r\n(light smile)\n\r\nMaybe that’s what it means to live among humans. To learn, little by little, how precious each fleeting \nnt truly is. And to carry those \nnts with you, no matter how far you travel… or how long you remain.\n\r\n\n\r\n(whispers)\n\r\nI’m still walking, you know. And I hope… wherever you are… you’re watching the path ahead of me.                ",

We’re a fast-moving wellness brand with a signature product stack, a proven customer base, and a bold goal to hit $100K+/month revenue in the next 90 days.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be given full strategic control of all inbound growth. This includes traffic generation, offer testing, sales tracking, landing page structure, funnel optimization, ad creative input, and ongoing reporting.\n\r\n\n\r\nThere will be no hand-holding. This is a leadership role, not an assistant role.\n\r\n\n\r\n? Top 3 Skills you must have:\n\r\nSEO Strategy & Organic Revenue Growth\n\r\nGoogle Search Console & Technical SEO Analysis\n\r\nGEO / AI Search Optimization (SGE, AI Overviews, Entity SEO)\n\r\n\n\r\n???? You Must Be:\n\r\nA proven growth hacker for e-commerce, not just a media buyer\n\r\nStrategic and analytical, but not afraid to roll up your sleeves\n\r\nObsessed with conversions, ROAS, LTV, CPA, and testing offers\n\r\nFocused on what moves revenue, not vanity metrics\n\r\nAble to build and scale offers across multiple platforms\n\r\nComfortable running Meta Ads, Google Ads, and YouTube Ads\n\r\nKnowledgeable in\n flows, SEO, and funnel optimization\n\r\nHighly independent, reliable, and resourceful\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Requirements:\n\r\n4+ years of direct e-commerce growth experience (show proof)\n\r\nCase study or 2-minute Loom video showing e-commerce store(s) you've scaled (revenue results + backend data)\n\r\nStrong understanding of eCom KPIs: CAC, ROAS, LTV, CTR, CVR\n\r\nFamiliarity with Shopify/WooCommerce, Klaviyo, Meta Ads, Google Ads, and landing page builders\n\r\nSolid experience driving traffic organically + through paid campaigns\n\r\nUnderstanding of upsells, AOV, bundling, and offer strategy\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Read Before Applying\n\r\n\n\r\nSovereign Spirits Inc. operates in the peptide, health optimization, and weight release space, which often overlaps with gray market products. This includes research-use-only compounds, novel ingredients, and niche wellness products not broadly understood or accepted by mainstrea\ndia and ad platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs a result, our marketing requires advanced knowledge of compliance-safe copywriting, funnel strategy, platform-specific ad policies, and indirect persuasion tactics. If you're not already familiar with working around restricted ad categories, gray-area supplements, or platform workarounds (e.g., running native,\n, SEO, or third-party traffic instead of Meta/Google ads alone), this is NOT the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe do not promote illegal or unsafe products. But due to public and regulatory misunderstanding of peptides and gray-market wellness compounds, we often face restrictions and ad rejections. Our success depends on clever, strategic, and ethical marketing that respects platform policies while still converting.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease do not apply unless:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are comfortable working in non-mainstream wellness spaces\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ve navigated compliance-heavy industries (CBD, crypto, nootropics, hormone support, biohacking, etc.)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re resourceful, creative, and okay with testing stealthy but ethical strategies\n\r\n\n\r\nYou have a solid understanding of conversion psychology and customer journey building outside of standard ad platforms\n\r\n\n\r\nMonthly Retainer + Performance Bonus Opportunity\n\r\nLocation: Remote\n\r\nEmployment Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire)                ",

    "description": "\n                    # AI Video Production Specialist — YouTube Channel Builder | Channel Research & Replication | Python/AI Coding | Thumbnails | Automation\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Job Description\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run a growing network of YouTube channels producing AI-assisted video content at scale. We're looking for someone with an obsessive eye for detail who can take any successful YouTube channel as a reference and recreate everything about it — the thumbnail style, title format, video structure, pacing, transitions, fonts, colors, music choices, subtitle style, description format, tags, upload schedule — down to the last pixel. Then put it into production and move on to the next one.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a programming-heavy role. Our videos are built programmatically — Python scripts, FFmpeg, AI APIs, TTS engines, image generation pipelines, subtitle generators, and automated assembly. You're not dragging clips around in a timeline. You're writing and modifying code that produces videos. If you can't work in a terminal, read Python, and debug errors, this isn't for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## The Core Job\n\r\n\n\r\n1. You actively research and find successful YouTube channels — both channels already using AI production and channels that aren't but could be replicated at scale using AI tools and automation. You identify opportunities and bring them to us.\n\r\n2. I also send you YouTube channel or video references to replicate.\n\r\n3. You study every single detail: thumbnail layout, font choices, color palette, text positioning, background style, title patterns, video length, intro style, pacing, music, voice tone, subtitle font/size/color/position, description template, tags, upload frequency, end screens, pinned comments — EVERYTHING.\n\r\n4. You assess what can be automated vs what needs manual work, and determine if the channel format can be profitably produced at scale.\n\r\n5. You document it all in a clear spec sheet.\n\r\n6. You configure and code our production pipeline to replicate that exact style — using Python, Claude Code, and AI tools to build or modify scripts for thumbnails, TTS voiceovers, subtitle formatting, and video assembly.\n\r\n7. You produce test videos and compare them side-by-side with the reference until they're indistinguishable in style and quality.\n\r\n8. You launch the channel into production.\n\r\n9. Repeat for the next channel.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## What You'll Be Doing Day-to-Day\n\r\n\n\r\n- Researching and identifying successful YouTube channels that are either fully AI-produced or could be replicated at scale using AI — analyzing their niche, content format, view counts, growth trajectory, and production style to determine if they're viable targets\n\r\n- Analyzing successful YouTube channels and breaking down exactly what makes them work (visual style, content structure, production quality, metadata strategy)\n\r\n- Writing and modifying Python scripts using AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) to customize production pipelines for each channel's unique style\n\r\n- Recreating thumbnail templates that match reference channels precisely (fonts, colors, layouts, image styles, text effects)\n\r\n- Configuring TTS voice settings, subtitle styles, video pacing, and assembly parameters to match reference content\n\r\n- Debugging and troubleshooting production code — reading error logs, fixing broken scripts, improving existing automation\n\r\n- Quality-checking every output against the reference — catching details others would miss (wrong font weight, subtitle position off by a few pixels, color slightly wrong, pacing too fast)\n\r\n- Managing video uploads, metadata, descriptions, tags, and scheduling across multiple channels\n\r\n- Building new automation features and tools as needed\n\r\n- Testing new AI tools and techniques to improve output quality\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Must-Haves\n\r\n\n\r\n- Proven experience with AI video production — you have actually used AI tools AND code to produce video content at scale, not just plugged prompts into websites. You must be able to show examples.\n\r\n- Experience programmatically creating video content or livestreams — using Python, FFmpeg, automation scripts, APIs, or similar tools to generate videos through code, not manual editing. If you've only ever used Premiere or CapCut by hand, this isn't the role.\n\r\n- Python programming ability — you will be writing, reading, modifying, and debugging Python scripts daily. This includes working with APIs (TTS, image generation, AI models), FFmpeg commands, file processing, and automation logic. AI coding assistants like Claude Code will help you, but you still need to understand what the code is doing.\n\r\n- Comfortable working in a terminal / command line (running scripts, SSH into servers, navigating folders, reading error logs, managing processes)\n\r\n- Obsessive attention to detail — if you're the kind of person who notices when a font is 1px too large or a color is slightly off, you're our person. If you think \"close enough\" is good enough, this role isn't for you.\n\r\n- Strong visual eye — you can look at a thumbnail and immediately identify the font, layout technique, color values, and effects used\n\r\n- Understanding of YouTube (what makes channels successful, how the algorithm works, metadata optimization)\n\r\n- Strong English communication skills\n\r\n- Self-starter who figures things out independently\n\r\n- Willing to use their own Claude Pro account for AI coding (we reimburse the $20/month subscription cost)\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Big Pluses\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience researching YouTube niches, analyzing channel performance, and identifying content opportunities\n\r\n- Experience managing or growing YouTube channels\n\r\n- Graphic design skills (Photoshop, Canva, Figma)\n\r\n- FFmpeg knowledge\n\r\n- Experience with TTS tools (ElevenLabs, Edge TTS, Kokoro, etc.)\n\r\n- Linux servers / SSH / VPS management\n\r\n- AI image generation experience (Stable Diffusion, Flux, Midjourney, DALL-E)\n\r\n- Video editing in any NLE (Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, CapCut)\n\r\n- Experience with subtitle/caption styling\n\r\n- Git / version control basics\n\r\n- Experience building or working with automation pipelines\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Work Details\n\r\n\n\r\n- Position: Part-time (20 hours/week)\n\r\n- Rate: $10 - $15 USD/hour depending on experience and skills\n\r\n- Hours: Flexible schedule, must overlap with North American hours for communication\n\r\n- Location: Remote (Philippines-based preferred)\n\r\n- Start: Immediately\n\r\n- Tools provided: Access to our servers, dashboards, and production systems. Claude Pro subscription reimbursed monthly.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## How to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Applications that don't follow these instructions will be ignored.\n\r\n\n\r\nStart your application message with the word KOKORO and include the phrase \"blue dog\" somewhere in your application to confirm you've read the entire posting.\n\r\n\n\r\nThen answer these questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. What is your experience with AI video production or programmatically creating video content? Describe the specific tools, scripts, or pipelines you've used. What did you build? How many videos were you producing? What was automated vs manual?\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Go to this YouTube channel: ",

That said, the expected monthly range is USD $700–$1,400(for full-time workers), depending on factors such as proficiency, workload, task complexity, performance (including bonuses), experience, skill set, and the final scope of responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Bonus]\n\r\nThere's potential for a performance-based bonus tied to key project milestones, such as a successful app launch and achieving performance metrics. We'll go over those details once you've demonstrated your skills.\n\r\n\n\r\n[What You’ll Be Doing]\n\r\nYour role is to be the technical architect and builder of our community website.

This includes implementing push notifications to ensure timely communication and integrating a streamlined way for users to access our support channels directly from the app.\n\r\n\n\r\nd) UI/UX Implementation & Performance Optimization: You will translate UI/UX designs into a pixel-perfect, functional application. Your focus will be on creating a fast, fluid, and responsive user experience, optimizing code and interactions to eliminate lag and ensure consistency across all devices and screen sizes.\n\r\n\n\r\ne) Comprehensive Testing & Quality Assurance: You will be responsible for rigorously testing the app to identify and fix bugs before launch. This includes creating detailed test cases for all features, covering edge cases, and testing for compatibility across multiple physical devices and OS versions.\n\r\n\n\r\nf) App Store Deployment & Management: You will manage the entire process of submitting and launching the application on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. This requires a deep understanding of each store's guidelines to ensure a smooth approval process and optimizing the listings for discoverability.\n\r\n\n\r\ng) Long-Term Maintenance & Scalability: After launch, you will provide ongoing maintenance, fix bugs, and release updates to ensure compatibility with new iOS and Android versions. You will build the app on a scalable architecture to make it easy to add new features and handle a growing user base in the future\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[A Typical Week May Look Like This]\n\r\n\n\r\nDuring Development: Writing clean, scalable code for new features. Collaborating with the team on API specifications. Implementing UI designs and animations. Debugging and testing builds on various devices. Committing code to our Git repository.\n\r\n\n\r\nPost-Launch: Monitoring app performance and crash reports. Planning and developing new features based on community feedback. Releasing updates to ensure compatibility with new iOS and Android versions.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Goal]\n\r\nThe ultimate goal is to create a fast, reliable, and intuitive mobile app that serves as a seamless extension of our online community. By building a high-quality application, you will empower our members to connect and share on the go, significantly boosting user engagement and making our community an essential part of their daily lives.\n\r\n\n\r\n[What We’re Looking For]\n\r\nThe ideal candidate:\n\r\n\n\r\na) Has a Strong Portfolio: You have verifiable experience building and launching native mobile applications. Not necessary, but it's best if you have live examples in the Apple App Store and/or Google Play Store. Experience with community or social media apps is a huge plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nb) Is Technically Proficient: You are an expert in your chosen mobile development stack (e.g., Swift/Kotlin, React Native, Flutter) and have deep experience working with REST APIs. You follow best practices and write clean, maintainable code.\n\r\n\n\r\nc) Is a Natural Problem-Solver: When faced with a technical challenge like a performance bottleneck, you have a logical process for diagnosing the root cause and implementing an effective solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nd) Is a Clear & Proactive Communicator: You can explain complex technical concepts simply.\n\r\n\n\r\ne) Is Product-Minded: You care about the end-user experience. You think critically about features and can offer valuable insights to help make the product better.\n\r\n\n\r\nf) Communicates Effectively and Values Respect: You are reliable, accountable, and understand the importance of clear communication within a remote team.\n\r\n\n\r\n*Important Note:\n\r\nWe value respectful communication. What does it mean? Most importantly, if you need to step away, just let me or your manager know when. We understand it, even if you need to leave tomorrow, BUT ghosting is the last thing you'd like to do, since it causes confusion and delays. In everyday conversations, our team thrives on mutual respect, no matter your role.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Why Work With Us?]\n\r\n\n\r\n-Flexible hours to suit your lifestyle.\n\r\n-The opportunity to own a project and build an exciting product from the ground up.\n\r\n-Long-term growth opportunities as our community and app scale.\n\r\n-A supportive environment where your technical expertise is valued and your impact is visible.\n\r\n\n\r\n[About Us]\n\r\nWe are building a vibrant online community for content creators. Our mission is to provide a space where members can connect, learn, and grow. Your role in building our mobile app is essential in taking that mission to the next level.\n\r\n\n\r\n[How to Apply]\n\r\nSubject Line: Start your title with “iOS App Developer” or \"Android App Developer\" whichever best identifies you, or your application can't be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application, include:\n\r\n\n\r\n1) Please indicate which items (a–f) from the [What You’ll Be Doing] section above you can handle professionally and confidently.\n\r\n\n\r\n2) Work History: Based on your response to Question 1, please describe your experience for each item (a–f).\n\r\n\n\r\n3) Portfolio: Include direct links to your two best live web applications you’ve built. Do not include all your projects. Time is very limited. Briefly describe your specific role and the tech stack used in those two projects.\n\r\n\n\r\n4) Technical Challenge: Imagine our users are reporting that the app feels slow and \"janky\" when they scroll through the main content feed. What are the first five steps you would take to diagnose and fix this performance issue?\n\r\n\n\r\n5) Architectural Scenario: You are tasked with building the in-app private messaging feature. Briefly describe the high-level architecture you would choose to ensure messages are delivered in real-time and that the system is both reliable and secure. Mention any key patterns or technologies you might use.\n\r\n\n\r\n6) Behind the Scenes. What is a popular trend, library, framework, or 'best practice' in mobile development that you believe is overrated or a poor choice in most situations? Justify your position with a specific example from a past project where you either used it and regretted it, or successfully argued against using it.\n\r\n\n\r\n7) Preferred Tool Stack: What are your go-to languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools for mobile app development? Please mention why you prefer them.\n\r\n\n\r\n8) AI in Your Workflow: Although AI-generated code can save time, it may include subtle bugs or security issues that less experienced developers might miss. Explain where and how you use AI to improve your development productivity, and where you deliberately choose not to rely on AI. (We expect you aren't using AI to answer these questions, as they will be discussed in the interview.)\n\r\n\n\r\n9) Available Hours: Let us know your general availability (e.g., \"Approximately 20 hours per week, mostly flexible between 1PM - 8PM on Monday, 3 PM - 10PM on Tuesday, 12PM - 8PM on Wednesday, ...,  in Philippines time\").\n\r\n\n\r\n10) Available Period of Work: Let us know for how long you expect to work with this job. We'd prefer a long-term collaboration.\n\r\n\n\r\n11) Willingness for Zoo\netings: Confirm that you're willing to participate in occasional Zoo\netings for team alignment and check-ins.\n\r\n\n\r\nI will respond to your application in 7-15 days all at once.\n\r\nWe look forward to hearing from you.

I discovered that you cannot use AI tools for this particular task, as you'd need to pick the best sentence among the 5 versions of the same context for each sentence one by one. I've tried this task with AI myself, and trust me it's my current best friend, but it cannot give me the result at the human level that I'd like. So, no AIs period.\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, only read further if you are confident in your ability to consistently select the most effective phrasing to build a high-quality, engaging video script.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role requires a keen eye for detail and a strong sense of narrative flow. If you have a passion for reading long scripts and enjoy learning about storytelling techniques while phrasing impactful sentences, this position will be a great fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis job relies on your human judgment to discern which sentence best serves the story and engages the viewer. The goal is to create a script that is clear, compelling, and flows seamlessly from one idea to the next.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[Job Title]\n\r\nProofreading - selecting best sentences among 5 variations\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[Work Type]\n\r\nRemote | Flexible Hours | Long-term Contract\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[Base Payment]\n\r\nYou’ll receive $100 USD per 10 project.\n\r\nCurrently, the other assistant gets each project done in 3-4 hours.\n\r\nI can provide 3-7 projects per week, depending on your speed.\n\r\nEach project involves working on a script for my video (each project = around 5000 words in English).\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[Bonus]\n\r\nThere's potential for a performance-based bonus through revenue sharing, depending on how well the long-form YouTube video performs in terms of views. We'll go over those details once you've demonstrated your skills, but you should be comfortable working with just the base pay initially.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[What You’ll Be Doing]\n\r\n\n\r\nYour primary task is to assemble the best possible version of a video script by choosing the most effective sentence from a set of options.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor a script of approximately 5000 words, each sentence will be presented with five different variations. Your job is to read through all five options and select the one that works best in the context of the paragraph and the overall script. You will repeat this process for every sentence until the entire script is complete.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere’s a step-by-step process for clarity:\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 1. Understand the Context - You will receive a complete script where each sentence is accompanied by five alternative versions.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 2. Select the Best Sentences - Choose the option that offers the best clarity, flow, and impact. Your selection should contribute to a cohesive and engaging narrative.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 3. Double Check - Once you have made a selection for every sentence, read through the completed script one last time to ensure it is coherent and polished.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 4. Submit the final script.\n\r\n\n\r\n*Note:\n\r\n-The first project may take a bit longer as we align on tone and style with feedback and revisions. I’ll provide detailed feedback on your first completed script to help guide that alignment.\n\r\n\n\r\n-I intend to reduce the revisions down to 1, but initially we may need more.\n\r\n\n\r\n-With each run, you will become more familiar with the content style, and the selection process will become faster and more intuitive on your end.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[Goal]\n\r\n\n\r\nThe goal is to craft a highly engaging and easy-to-follow script by meticulously selecting the best version of every sentence. This process ensures the final script is polished and holds the audience's attention from start to finish.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis method is designed to be more efficient than rewriting from scratch. Instead of spending time guessing my intended tone, you can focus entirely on choosing the strongest lines from pre-written options, which keeps the process focused and effective.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[What We’re Looking For]\n\r\nThe ideal candidate:\n\r\n\n\r\n-Has an advanced or native level of written English and a strong grasp of grammar, idioms, and slang. This is crucial for quickly and accurately judging which phrases are most effective.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Is coachable and eager to grow with the channel.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Communicates effectively and values mutual respect.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Has strong time management skills to meet deadlines.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Is accountable and committed to the role.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Can collaborate with me or our team to ensure the content’s vibe aligns with our creative vision.\n\r\n\n\r\n*Important Note:\n\r\nWe value respectful communication.

This position requires deep empathy, exceptional storytelling skills, and a genuine interest in helping our audience solve their problems. You will be responsible for shaping our brand's voice and authority from the ground up.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you view content as simply a numbers game of ranking keywords and driving quick sales, this role may be a challenge for you.

Metrics could include audience engagement, content-driven community growth, and positive feedback.

You will be responsible for the end-to-end content creation process, ensuring every piece is valuable, credible, and engaging.

What does it mean? Most importantly, if you need to step away, just let me or your manager know why and when. We understand it, even if you need to leave tomorrow, BUT ghosting is the last thing you'd like to do, since it causes confusion and delays.

How did you handle the feedback, what did you learn from it, and how did it influence your approach to writing moving forward?\n\r\n\n\r\n4) Strategic Challenge: Imagine our brand is facing some skepticism in the market about a new product or service. How would you develop a content strategy to address this skepticism and rebuild trust with our audience? What are the key ethical considerations you would keep in mind?\n\r\n\n\r\n5) Ethical Persuasion: How would you explain the difference between 'persuasion' and 'manipulation' in copywriting? Can you provide an example from your own work where you consciously chose a persuasive, rather than manipulative, approach?\n\r\n\n\r\n6) Preferred Tool Stack: What are your go-to tools for research, writing, editing, and SEO? Please mention why you prefer them.\n\r\n\n\r\n7) AI in Your Workflow: Explain where and how you use AI to improve your content creation productivity (e.g., for research, brainstorming, editing), and where you deliberately choose not to rely on AI to preserve authenticity and trust. (We expect you aren't using AI to answer these questions, as they will be discussed further in an interview.)\n\r\n\n\r\n8) Available Hours: Let us know your general availability (e.g., \"Approximately 20 hours per week, mostly flexible between 1PM - 8PM on Monday, 3 PM - 10PM on Tuesday, 12PM - 8PM on Wednesday, ...,  in Philippines time\").\n\r\n\n\r\n9) Available Period of Work: Let us know for how long you expect to work with us.

We specialize in making team sport athletes faster through sprint training, plyometrics, change of direction work, and Olympic lifting. We have 100+ athletes and are growing fast. We need someone to help us turn raw training footage into content that gets attention.\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\nVideo Editing (Primary)\n\r\n\n\r\nEdit 1 long-form YouTube video per week (training tutorials, educational content — think: how to clean, hamstring injury prevention, sprint mechanics). These are mostly talking-head + training footage with simple cuts, text overlays, and light graphics.\n\r\nEdit short-form reels/clips from raw training footage. Most reels are simple — a kid hitting a PR on a lift or a fast sprint time, set to music with a caption. Occasionally we'll do something with a bit more production value.\n\r\nRepurpose long-form YouTube content into short-form clips for Instagram Reels, TikTok, and\n.\n\r\n\n\r\nSocial Media Posting & Scheduling\n\r\n\n\r\nWrite captions (or refine drafts I provide) for all posts.\n\r\nSchedule and post content across Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and\n.\n\r\nMaintain a consistent posting schedule (we'll work together on frequency — likely 3–5 reels/week + 1 YouTube upload).\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience editing fitness, sports, or coaching content (show me examples)\n\r\nAbility to create engaging short-form content with text overlays, captions, and music\n\r\nYouTube thumbnail creation — this is important, not optional\n\r\nFamiliarity with posting and scheduling tools for Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and\n\r\nReliable, communicative, and able to meet deadlines\n\r\nUnderstanding of what performs well on each platform (vertical for IG/TikTok, horizontal for YouTube, etc.)\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus (Not Required)\n\r\n\n\r\nBasic graphic design skills\n\r\nKnowledge of strength training, sports performance, or athletics\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nSend me:\n\r\n\n\r\nA brief intro about yourself and your experience\n\r\nLinks to 2–3 examples of short-form or long-form content you've edited (fitness/sports preferred but not required)\n\r\nA YouTube thumbnail you've created\n\r\nYour availability and timezone\n\r\n\n\r\nPaid Test Edit: Top applicants will be given access to a Google Drive folder with raw training footage (a 10-minute tutorial on how to do a clean, plus some short clips of athletes performing the lift). Your task will be to produce one edited long-form YouTube video, one short-form reel, and a thumbnail. This is a paid test — we want to see your actual work with our content before making a final hire.\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you!                ",
