    "description": "\n                    We're not looking for someone who's \"pretty good.\" We need someone who's obsessive about details.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe kind of person who notices when an image is 2 pixels off. Who reads a caption four times before hitting publish. Who finds typos that spell-check misses. If you've been called \"picky\" or \"perfectionist\" before—and you took it as a compliment—keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Actually Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\nRight now, we have two core needs. More will come as you grow with us.\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Social Media Scheduling in \n\r\n\n\r\nUpload posts across Instagram,\n, GMB, X, and Pinterest. Add images, captions, alt tags—and make sure everything is polished before it goes live. You'll work inside Sprout Social, which handles all platforms in one place. If you haven't used Sprout, we'll train you. And the skills will make you more marketable if we ever part ways.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Web Content in WordPress + Elementor\n\r\n\n\r\nPlace content on pages. Follow our standards for styling, spacing, image handling, and metadata. You’ll also create and categorize pages intelligently. If you've used Elementor before, great. If not, we'll train you—but you need to be comfortable in WordPress already. You do not need to be a designer, but you need to know if something looks good or not. \n\r\n\n\r\nThat's the work. It's repetitive. It requires focus. And it must be nearly error-free because our clients have zero tolerance for sloppy presentation. We're saying that out loud so you can self-select. If you thrive on variety and hate repeating tasks, or you’re just looking for something to pay you, this isn't for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nVital info: In your application, use this phrase somewhere so we know you actually read this: \"detail-driven\"\n\r\n\n\r\nWe expect general competencies in typing, Google Workspace, Gmail, Google Drive, and all of the other Google Apps. We also expect you to be self-managed and proactive. You should expect that out of yourself as well. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou may have other VA-type tasks assigned to you as well. We may even need some assistance with AI in writing and running assessments and checks. Have a background in SEO or design? Let us know!\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We're Hoping to Find\n\r\n\n\r\nWe realize our budget is entry-level. We're not hiding that. What we offer in exchange: real training, meaningful work, and a long-term home if you're the COMMITTED kind of person who grows with the companies you join. We've built this agency on relationships, not revolving doors. If you’re younger and getting going, come aboard. If you’re more experienced but without work, read on…\n\r\n\n\r\nSo who fits?\n\r\n\n\r\n• A social media manager who wants hands-on experience with Sprout and a more technical workflow.\n\r\n• A web designer or WordPress builder who wants more exposure to other areas of digital marketing and content strategy.\n\r\n• A VA or data entry professional looking to level up into WordPress, Elementor, and real marketing projects.\n\r\n• A project manager or strategist between gigs who wants to get your foot in the door and prove your skills—even if the starting rate is lower than you'd normally take. Come show your value and we may have another place for you. \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're motivated, reliable, and obsessively detail-oriented? We want to hear from you.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n• Equipped with a reliable computer and stable internet connection\n\r\n• Able to meet via video call 2–3x per week with management (up to 5 the first few weeks)\n\r\n• Willing to produce brief daily reports in our time-tracking software\n\r\n• Comfortable learning new industry-leading online tools (we'll train the right person)\n\r\n• Available 4–8 hours per day, consistently (you can let us know what works for you)\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n\n\r\nUSD $3-$4/hour depending on experience (starting). We pay bi-weekly initially to get you some fuel and build trust for the 1st three pay periods and monthly thereafter. There's room to grow as you prove yourself—this is meant to be a long-term fit, not a quick gig.\n\r\n\n\r\nWant a Long-Term Career?\n\r\n\n\r\nWe take our investments in our partners seriously. Ideally, we’d like this to work ou,t and you continue without agency. Here’s how it works:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe Dance, We Date, We Marry: All independent contractors entering our organization enter into a probationary period of one month, followed by three months (minimum) before we commit to anything longer. We operate in this manner to determine fit, climate/cultural countenance, and to ensure you are in “the right seat on the bus.”\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not reply here with a generic message. We will not respond.\n\r\n\n\r\nInstead:\n\r\n\n\r\nSubmit your application via this form: \n\r\n\n\r\nThen reply here to confirm you submitted the form.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you only reply here without using the form, your application won't be considered. You’d be amazed at how many people on here don’t follow directions and keep following up.  \n\r\n\n\r\nThanks!                ",

We're not seeking rabbit chasers, \n\r\n\n\r\nWe have a small and focused marketing agency that works for a few products and personal brands. We need a skilled editor who is also an artist... \n\r\n\n\r\nYou have high competency in Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and the Adobe Suite... as well as the technicalities of video production, media sizes, audio clean-up, etc. We find the best post-production creatives typically play in many areas, such as photography, design, motion, drawing, painting, etc. Share your passions for us to have a great sense of who you are. \n\r\n\n\r\nIdeally, you have a strong portfolio in animation and a good sense of graphic design principles. And you know how to manage files in a professional workflow.\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd most of all, you are intuitive and versatile. You know that millisecond when to cut between words... You know how to select an appropriate stock b-roll clip and can choose a song to match the objective. You LOVE having all the tools with flexibility for your creativity to flourish, yet you have a solid track record of moving projects to completion. \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you primarily stick to lighter tools such as Canva and phone app-based editing programs, we're not a fit. We'll be asking about your computer's specs, your upload speed, and other requirements for more experienced designers. If you also know when and how to use them \n\r\n\n\r\nShow us your best work. Looking for portfolios with both animation and editing, but open to people who may have a specialization in one or the other. In terms of animation and design style, our initial project will be with simple, minimal graphics that are intelligently orchestrated with philosophical insights. \n\r\n\n\r\nAll applicants who we feel may be a fit will be hired for 1-3 paid test projects. We'll invest in seeing if we are a fit because we are determining how much project management and input we'll need to have in the early stages. Ideally, we're looking for someone who wants to grow and evolve with our unique, potent, growing agency for many years. If you're a proactive self-starter who \"gets it,\" write us. \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you have a friend or two you love working with, we're also open to hiring a team. Pay will be determined on your competency, productivity, and overall efficiency. We are rapidly expanding in video production, so there is an opportunity to start part-time and grow into something greater. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply: Prepare your portfolio and info. Then follow the instructions below. \n\r\n\n\r\n1) You must submit your application via this link: \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n2) Reply here to notify us that you've submitted. Note: if you only reply here, you will not get a response and your application won't be considered.

    "description": "\n                    We're a growing US-based digital marketing agency that builds websites and runs SEO for home service contractors (HVAC, roofing, plumbing, electrical). We need a sharp web designer/page builder who can take AI-generated pages from about 90% to 100% — that last 10% where a real human eye makes the difference.\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing:\n\r\n\n\r\nBuilding out service pages and location pages on WordPress using page builders (Elementor, Divi, or similar)\n\r\nWorking inside \nv (an AI web development tool) to generate and refine pages — you don't need to know it yet, but you need to be tech-savvy enough to learn it fast\n\r\nTaking rough wireframes, reference sites, or verbal direction and turning them into clean, professional pages that convert\n\r\nMatching and maintaining brand consistency across multiple client websites\n\r\nMaking design tweaks, spacing adjustments, font/color refinements — the small stuff that separates amateur sites from professional ones\n\r\nLight image editing (cropping, resizing, basic Canva or Photoshop work for hero images and graphics)\n\r\nCommunicating progress daily and flagging issues before they become problems\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For:\n\r\n\n\r\n2+ years of experience building WordPress websites (send examples or portfolio links — no portfolio = automatic no)\n\r\nStrong visual design sense — you notice when padding is off, fonts don't match, or a layout feels wrong\n\r\nComfortable learning new AI tools quickly (\nv, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)\n\r\nReliable internet and a professional work setup\n\r\nAble to work US business hours (Eastern Time) or have significant overlap\n\r\nDetail-oriented and self-motivated — you don't need to be micromanaged\n\r\nGood written English communication\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus (Not Required):\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with Elementor, Divi, or Bricks Builder\n\r\nBasic understanding of SEO (page structure, heading hierarchy, internal linking)\n\r\nCanva or Photoshop skills\n\r\nExperience working with US-based agencies or clients\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us:\n\r\nWe're a small but growing agency (RAM Digital) focused on getting real results for contractors. We use AI tools heavily to move fast, but we know that AI alone doesn't produce great work — it takes a skilled human to polish it. If you're the kind of person who cares about the details and takes pride in clean, professional design work, we want to hear from you.\n\r\nThis is a long-term position with room to grow as we scale.\n\r\n\n\r\n?? HOW TO APPLY (READ THIS — applications that skip this step will be ignored):\n\r\n\n\r\nStart your application with the word \"BLUEPRINT\" so we know you read the full post\n\r\nInclude a link to 2-3 websites you've personally built or designed (not agency portfolios — YOUR work)\n\r\nTell us in 2-3 sentences: What's the #1 thing most WordPress sites get wrong visually, and how do you fix it?

Impact does.)\n\r\n\n\r\nThere’s a specific kind of person we’re looking for.\n\r\nNot just a writer.\n\r\nNot just a developer.\n\r\nSomeone who has lived through WordPress.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ve built the late-night client sites.\n\r\nYou’ve wrestled with Elementor layouts that broke for no reason.\n\r\nYou’ve refreshed a dashboard and held your breath after updating plugins.\n\r\nYou’ve migrated hosts, cleaned hacked installs, debugged WooCommerce checkout chaos.\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd somewhere along the way… you started writing about it.\n\r\n\n\r\nMaybe it was a blog.\n\r\nMaybe Medium.\n\r\nMaybe just long Reddit replies where you explained things better than the official documentation ever did.\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd you realized something:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re not just good at building things.\n\r\nYou’re good at explaining them.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can take something technical, messy, and overwhelming…\n\r\nand make it feel simple. Human. Clear.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’re reading this and thinking,\n\r\n“Wait. That’s literally me.”\n\r\nKeep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY THIS ROLE EXISTS\n\r\n\n\r\nSGEN is building something better.\n\r\n\n\r\nBut here’s the truth:\n\r\n\n\r\nIt doesn’t matter how good a product is if no one understands it.\n\r\nWe need someone who makes SGEN understandable to the outside world.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen someone Googles a question at 1:14 AM — frustrated, stuck, ready to quit —\n\r\n they shouldn’t find silence.\n\r\n\n\r\nThey should find you.\n\r\n\n\r\nClear answers.\n\r\nHonest comparisons.\n\r\nStep-by-step guidance.\n\r\nA voice that sounds like a smart friend, not a corporate manual.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are the bridge between complexity and clarity.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO YOU ARE\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re naturally curious.\n\r\nIf something doesn’t have documentation, you don’t wait to be assigned. You fix it.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou open a product and instinctively think:\n\r\n“This needs a getting-started guide.”\n\r\n“That error message needs explaining.”\n\r\n“New users will get stuck here.”\n\r\n\n\r\nYou remember what it felt like to not know what a CMS was.\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd when you explain it, you don’t use jargon.\n\r\nYou don’t flex vocabulary.\n\r\nYou just make it make sense.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour writing feels like a conversation over coffee.\n\r\nNot stiff.\n\r\nNot robotic.\n\r\nNot AI-generated.\n\r\nJust clear.\n\r\n\n\r\nYOU HAVE OPINIONS (AND THAT'S GOOD)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou probably have thoughts about WordPress architecture.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou might love it.\n\r\nYou might be tired of it.\n\r\nYou definitely have stories.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe don’t need neutral.\n\r\nWe don’t need safe.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone who can say:\n\r\n“Here’s why this is broken.”\n\r\n“Here’s why this is better.”\n\r\n“And here’s where we still need to improve.”\n\r\n\n\r\nFair. Honest. Confident.\n\r\n\n\r\nNot loud. Not defensive.\n\r\n\n\r\nJust grounded in real experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nYOU'RE NOT FRAGILE ONLINE\n\r\n\n\r\nReddit can be brutal.\n\r\n\n\r\nBlog comments can be snarky.\n\r\n\n\r\nSomeone will say:\n\r\n“SGEN is just another startup that’ll be dead in a year.”\n\r\n\n\r\nYou don’t panic.\n\r\nYou don’t rage-reply.\n\r\nYou don’t disappear.\n\r\nYou respond with clarity and calm.\n\r\n\n\r\nBecause you know the difference between criticism and noise.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL ACTUALLY DO\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll dive deep into SGEN.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll build test sites. Break things. Explore edges.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll document:\n\r\n- The first-click experience\n\r\n- The confusing parts\n\r\n- The missing explanations\n\r\n- The friction\n\r\n\n\r\nThen you’ll write:\n\r\n\n\r\nClear documentation.\n\r\nStep 1. Step 2. Screenshot. Expected result.\n\r\n\n\r\nBlog posts that actually say something.\n\r\nNot filler. Not fluff. Not SEO sludge.\n\r\n\n\r\nComparison pages that feel honest.\n\r\nGuides that prevent support tickets.\n\r\nReddit answers that genuinely help someone.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll publish consistently. Weekly. Reliably.\n\r\nBecause content works through rhythm, not bursts.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT MATTERS MOST\n\r\nNative-level written English.\n\r\nNot technically correct — natural.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen someone in the US reads your writing, they shouldn’t think,\n\r\n“Oh, this was written overseas.”\n\r\n\n\r\nThey should think,\n\r\n“This person gets it.”\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ve built WordPress sites for at least 2 years.\n\r\nNot theory. Not tutorials. Real clients. Real mess.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand:\n\r\n- Plugin conflicts\n\r\n- Theme weirdness\n\r\n- Hosting nightmares\n\r\n- Security scares\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd when you write about them, it’s fro\nmory — not Google.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can write both:\n\r\n- A bold opinion piece\n\r\n and\n\r\n- A precise technical guide.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand basic SEO — not in a spammy way, but structurally.\n\r\nYou know what helps content rank without making it unreadable.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can screenshot. Screen record.

We are a small, tight-knit team that values quality over quantity, clear communication, and people who take ownership of their work.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nWe are looking for a full-time website and page designer to own the visual design layer across all of our clients. Everything that goes on a client’s website starts with your design in Figma. You will be the person responsible for how every client’s website and strategic pages look before they go to development.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a dedicated, full-time position. We are not looking for freelancers juggling multiple clients. We need someone who is fully committed to our team and available during working hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Be Doing\n\r\n• Website design for all clients — homepage redesigns, new website builds, landing page designs, and any other page design work. All designs live in Figma.\n\r\n• Strategic page design — pillar pages, service pages, and city/geo landing pages. These are high-impact pages that drive SEO rankings and conversions. You will create design templates per client for each page type so new pages can be produced efficiently while staying visually consistent.\n\r\n• Design QA — after the developer builds your designs, you review the live build against your Figma to make sure everything matches. You catch what’s off before it goes live.\n\r\n• Conversion optimization — you design with conversions in mind. CTA placement, visual hierarchy, form positioning, and trust signals. When data shows a page isn’t converting, you’ll adjust the design based on what the SEO strategist flags.\n\r\n• Social media graphics — static post designs for client social media accounts. Consistent brand design across platforms.\n\r\n• Collaboration — you’ll work closely with our content writer, SEO strategist, and developer. Communication happens in Slack and you’re expected to be responsive during working hours.\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n• Proficient in Figma — this is our primary design tool. Everything you create lives here.\n\r\n• Website design experience — you understand layout, spacing, typography, and how to design pages that look professional and convert visitors into leads.\n\r\n• Mobile-first design — every design must account for both desktop and mobile. This is non-negotiable.\n\r\n• Attention to detail — pixel-level precision matters. When you hand off a design to development, it should be clean and complete.\n\r\n• Strong communication — you respond promptly in Slack, ask questions when something is unclear, and flag issues before they become problems.\n\r\n• Reliable and consistent — you show up, you meet deadlines, and you don’t need to be chased for updates.\n\r\n• Able to take direction and also think independently — we’ll give you briefs and feedback, but we also want you to bring your own design perspective and speak up when you see something that could be better.\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have\n\r\n• Experience designing for WordPress or Elementor-based websites\n\r\n• Understanding of basic SEO principles (headings, CTAs, page structure)\n\r\n• Experience creating infographics or data visualizations\n\r\n• Familiarity with brand identity and style guide creation\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n• Fixed monthly salary — no tracking hours, no guessing what your paycheck will be. Stable, predictable income every month.\n\r\n• Long-term position — we are not hiring for a project. We want someone who grows with the team.\n\r\n• Clear role and ownership — you own the design layer across every client. Your work is valued and visible.\n\r\n• Small team, real impact — you’re not a number. Your input matters and your work directly affects our clients’ results.\n\r\n• Room to grow — as we expand social media and take on new clients, your role and responsibilities will grow with the agency.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nDo not send your resume as I am not interested in that but your work. \n\r\n\n\r\n• A link to your portfolio or Figma projects showing website design work (not just logos or social media graphics — we need to see full page designs)\n\r\n• A brief message telling us about your experience and why you’re a good fit\n\r\n• Your availability to start\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications without a portfolio will not be considered.

Both entities are GST registered and operate in professional services.\n\r\nThis is a project-based role with a clear path to regular ongoing work if you do a great job.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Scope\n\r\nThe company generates roughly 5–10 transactions per day. The partnership generates 1–3 per day. Neither entity has been reconciled — we're starting from scratch across approximately 18 months. In total you're likely looking at 3,000–5,000+ transactions across both files.\n\r\nYour job is to get both Xero files clean, correctly categorised, and ready for my BAS agent to review and lodge. You do not need to lodge anything yourself.\n\r\n\n\r\nSpecifically you will:\n\r\n\n\r\nReconcile all bank transactions across both Xero entities from the start\n\r\nCategorise expenses to the correct accounts using the right Australian chart of accounts\n\r\nApply correct GST tax codes (GST, GST-free, BAS excluded, input-taxed) to all transactions\n\r\nProactively identify and flag legitimate business expenses that can be claimed — I want to make sure nothing is missed\n\r\nFlag any transactions you're unsure about so I can clarify — I'm available for questions throughout\n\r\nDeliver both files in a state where my BAS agent can go straight to lodgement without cleaning up behind you\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I'm Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nMinimum 3 years experience bookkeeping for Australian clients or working within an Australian accounting firm or BPO\n\r\nDeep understanding of Australian GST — not just how to apply codes, but knowing what's claimable and what isn't for a professional services business\n\r\nXero proficient — bank reconciliation, tax codes, chart of accounts, and working across multiple separate organisations\n\r\nSomeone who works independently but communicates clearly when they have questions\n\r\nDetail-oriented — I'd rather you ask than guess\n\r\n\n\r\nScreening Question — Required\n\r\nApplications without this will not be considered.\n\r\nIn your own words, explain: what is GST, how does it apply to a registered Australian business, and what is a BAS? Also briefly describe how you would approach reconciling a Xero file that has had no reconciliation done from the start.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply Include:\n\r\n\n\r\nYour CV with specific Australian clients or firms you've worked with\n\r\nYour answer to the screening question above\n\r\nYour proposed project rate (fixed fee preferred, or hourly with an estimated total)\n\r\nYour availability and how quickly you could start\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Happens After You Apply\n\r\nShortlisted candidates will be given a small paid test task — approximately 20–30 sample transactions to categorise. This is paid and takes around 30–60 minutes. It's the fastest way for both of us to know if it's a good fit before committing to the full project.\n\r\nStrong performers on this project will be offered regular ongoing bookkeeping work.

You can take a concept and run with it\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't for you if you need weeks of feedback cycles, prefer slow methodical editing, or don't have proven ad experience specifically.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nStart your message with the word \"STORM\" — applications without it won't be reviewed.\n\r\nThen answer the following:\n\r\n\n\r\nHave you edited ads for an e-commerce brand? Name the product type, your role, and what the ads were trying to accomplish.\n\r\nShare your portfolio. Which piece are you most proud of — and what made it work?\n\r\nWalk us through one ad from brief to final cut. What was the challenge, and how did you solve it?\n\r\nHow have you used 11 Labs? Be specific — what projects, what use case, what result?\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWe move fast and we respond to strong applicants quickly. If your work is good, you'll hear from us.                ",

This is the most critical function of the role.\n\r\n•\tMeeting & Leadership Support — Prepare agendas and pre-reads, capture minutes and action items, track accountability, and ensure Directors have what they need ahead of key meetings.\n\r\n•\tFinancial & Reporting Support — Revenue summaries, targets vs actuals, invoice follow-up, department dashboards, and budget tracking across Xero and Google Sheets.\n\r\n•\tCRM & Systems — Keep CRM data clean, manage job management platforms, maintain SOPs, and support system migrations and process documentation.\n\r\n•\tSales & Client Support — Draft proposals and pitch decks, track pipeline activity, prepare client-facing collateral, and research new business opportunities.\n\r\n•\tOperations & Production — Coordinate suppliers, track SLAs, follow up on production deadlines, and manage vendor databases.\n\r\n•\tMarketing & Content — Schedule social content, draft LinkedIn posts for the GM, repurpose internal content into external thought leadership, and research competitor positioning.\n\r\n•\tTravel & Personal Admin — Book travel (domestic and international), manage personal appointments, coordinate household admin, handle remote errands, and manage subscriptions.\n\r\n•\tAI & Automation — Use Claude, ChatGPT, Zapier, and similar tools to accelerate workflows, automate repeatable processes, and continuously improve efficiency.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’re Looking For\n\r\n•\t3+ years as an EA or VA supporting a senior leader\n\r\n•\tExceptional written and verbal English — you’ll be writing as the GM\n\r\n•\tStrong commercial awareness and ability to understand business context quickly\n\r\n•\tHighly organised with relentless follow-through and attention to detail\n\r\n•\tProactive problem-solver who fixes things before anyone notices\n\r\n•\tComfortable managing up — you’ll hold leadership accountable, diplomatically\n\r\n•\tTech-fluent across Google Workspace, Slack, CRM, and project management tools\n\r\n•\tAvailable to work Australian business hours (AEST/AEDT)\n\r\n•\tDiscreet and trustworthy with confidential information\n\r\n\n\r\nYou Are\n\r\n•\tProactive — you anticipate needs and act before being asked\n\r\n•\tAn owner — you treat leadership priorities as your own\n\r\n•\tEmotionally intelligent — you read situations and adapt with discretion\n\r\n•\tRelentless — zero dropped balls, ever\n\r\n•\tResourceful — you find solutions before escalating\n\r\n•\tPremium — you take pride in polished, high-quality work\n\r\n\n\r\nHow We’ll Measure Success\n\r\n•\tGM’s inbox at zero unactioned items daily\n\r\n•\tAll action items tracked and followed up within 24 hours\n\r\n•\tZero missed deadlines across executive and Director priorities\n\r\n•\tWeekly reporting delivered on time, every time\n\r\n•\tDepartment follow-ups executed without prompting\n\r\n•\tGM operating in a full CEO capacity within 90 days\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nSubmit your resume/CV and a brief cover letter or Loom video explaining why you’re the right fit. Please include two professional references from previous executive-level support roles.                ",

    "description": "\n                    WHO WE ARE\n\r\nCandor Marketing is a nationally focused agency that builds predictable patient pipelines exclusively for aesthetic and wellness clinics. We don't sell marketing services — we sell outcomes. We guarantee results, we operate on documented systems, and we build everything on the Hormozi framework: make the offer so good that saying no feels stupid, deliver so much value that clients never want to leave, and build systems that scale without depending on any one person.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe hire specialists. Not generalists. If you're the best at what you do and you want to be part of building a nationally recognized brand, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE ROLE\n\r\nYou are the engine behind every client account. You build and manage the complete GoHighLevel infrastructure that turns ad clicks into booked appointments — automatically, reliably, and at a standard that makes our clients feel like they have a world-class tech team in their corner.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a builder role. You own the system.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\nBuild and manage all client GoHighLevel sub-accounts including pipelines, automations, SMS and\n follow-up sequences, reactivation campaigns, reputation management workflows, and live reporting dashboards.\n\r\n\n\r\nConnect all client landing pages — built externally in Webflow, Lovable, or ClickFunnels — to GoHighLevel so every form submission triggers the correct pipeline stage, automation sequence, and contact record instantly and accurately.\n\r\nBuild automated follow-up sequences that convert leads into booked appointments without any manual effort from the clinic. Every sequence needs to feel human, move with urgency, and reflect the value-dense Hormozi style offer the client is running.\n\r\nRun patient reactivation campaigns into existing client databases every 60 days — segmented, sequenced, and built to generate found revenue with zero ad spend.\n\r\n\n\r\nBuild and maintain real-time dashboards every client can check from their phone showing exactly what their investment is producing. No vanity metrics. Revenue, leads, booked appointments, cost per acquisition.\n\r\nDocument every workflow, automation, and system you build in our SOP library. If you get hit by a bus tomorrow, someone else can run your accounts by end of day. That's the standard.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU NEED\n\r\nMinimum 2 years of hands-on GoHighLevel experience with complex multi-step automations and full sub-account builds. Proof of work required — no exceptions.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience integrating GoHighLevel with third party platforms via Zapier or Make.\n\r\n\n\r\nFamiliarity connecting external landing page platforms like Webflow, Lovable, or ClickFunnels to GHL form submissions and automation triggers.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong understanding of lead nurture logic, pipeline architecture, and conversion principles.\n\r\nExperience with clinic or healthcare software like Jane App, Mindbody, or PatientNow is a strong plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO YOU ARE\n\r\nYou are obsessively organized, proactive, and you take ownership. You don't wait for things to break. You catch problems before clients do. You communicate clearly in writing, work independently without hand-holding, and you build systems you're proud of — clean architecture, properly named automations, documented workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand that in the Hormozi framework every system we build needs to be so dialed in, so value-dense, and so results-oriented that our clients would feel crazy leaving. You build with that standard in mind every single time.\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION\n\r\nStrictly hourly. $25–$45/hour based on experience. Hours tracked and submitted weekly. Workload scales with our client roster. Strong performers move into retainer arrangements as the agency grows.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nApply with \"Candor Marketing - GHL Specialist\" as your subject line to be proof you have read the description. ALL applications that do not do this will be discarded immediately. We also require you include a brief description of the most complex GHL system you've ever built plus two or three examples of your work — screenshots, a Loom walkthrough. No proof of work, no consideration.                ",

    "description": "\n                    About the Role\n\r\n\n\r\nI run a video production business creating content for YouTube creators and brands. I need a reliable, detail-oriented video editor to handle short-form content (YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels) and straightforward long-form YouTube edits on an ongoing, long-term basis — not a one-off project.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will primarily be editing for one client to start, with additional editing work from other clients as the relationship grows. This is a role with room to expand in both scope and compensation as my business scales.\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant Note About Content: The primary client you'll be editing for produces right-leaning American political commentary. The content includes strong opinions, humor, and topics that some may find controversial or offensive. You must be comfortable working with this type of material professionally, regardless of your personal views. If political content would make you uncomfortable or affect the quality of your work, this is not the right fit — no hard feelings.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Editing\n\r\nShort-form videos (YouTube Shorts / Instagram Reels):\n\r\n\n\r\n30–90 second clips cut from longer livestreams and recorded content\n\r\nTalking head commentary with b-roll, text overlays, and music\n\r\nFull styled captions/subtitles (you will handle transcription and captioning — style specs provided)\n\r\nComedy and timing are a big part of what makes these work — you need to recognize what's funny and how to land a punchline through editing\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-form YouTube videos (8–20 minutes):\n\r\n\n\r\nEdited from streams and recorded content\n\r\nCuts, pacing, basic color correction, basic transitions, and light graphics\n\r\nNo heavy motion graphics required\n\r\n\n\r\nB-Roll Sourcing (Both Short-Form and Long-Form):\n\r\nThis is a key part of the role. You will be responsible for finding and incorporating appropriate b-roll into your edits. This includes:\n\r\n\n\r\nResearching and downloading relevant news clips from YouTube — if the video covers a recent event, you need to find footage of that event to edit into the video\n\r\nFinding images of specific people, places, or i\n referenced in the content\n\r\nUsing stock footage where appropriate — you must have access to a stock footage platform (Storyblocks, Artlist, Canva Pro, or similar)\n\r\nGeneral awareness of American politics and current events is important, OR you must have excellent research skills to quickly find relevant visuals for topics you may not be familiar with\n\r\n\n\r\nAs the role grows, you may also edit similar content for other clients — short-form clips, reels, and simple long-form edits across different niches.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n\n\r\nAdobe Premiere Pro — You must own or have reliable access to Premiere Pro. You will deliver both finished exports AND the Premiere Pro project file (.prproj) with all assets organized so I can go back in and make revisions if needed. Access to the broader Adobe Suite (After Effects, Photoshop, etc.) is a plus but not required.\n\r\n\n\r\nDescript — You must have a Descript subscription for transcription and caption/subtitle work. If you don't currently have one, you must be willing to get one. I will provide the exact caption style specifications.\n\r\nStock footage access — You must have a subscription to a stock footage/media platform (Storyblocks, Artlist, Canva Pro, or equivalent) for sourcing b-roll where news clips or specific footage aren't available.\n\r\n\n\r\nExcellent English comprehension — this is absolutely critical. The primary creator you'll be editing has a very thick Southern American accent. Even native English speakers sometimes need to replay sections to catch what he's saying. You need to be confident in your ability to accurately transcribe and caption heavily accented, fast-paced American English. If English comprehension is not one of your strongest skills, this role will be extremely difficult and frustrating for both of us. Please be honest with yourself about this.\n\r\n\n\r\nResearch skills — You need to be resourceful. If the creator references a news story, a political figure, or a past i\n, you must be able to quickly research it and find relevant images, clips, or footage to include as b-roll in the edit.\n\r\n\n\r\nFamiliarity with American pop culture, internet humor, \ns, and current events is a strong plus. The content includes references to trending topics, political figures, and internet culture. You don't need to be an expert, but awareness helps you make better editing choices and find better b-roll.\n\r\n\n\r\nReliable internet connection and ability to download/upload large video files regularly.\n\r\n\n\r\nAvailable to start within 1 week.\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have (Not Required)\n\r\n\n\r\nAI image/video generation skills — Some edits benefit from AI-generated visuals, especially for comedy segments where traditional b-roll doesn't exist. If you have experience with AI tools (Midjourney, Runway, Kling, etc.), that's a major bonus. If not, I'm willing to train you on this, as it's my specialty.\n\r\n\n\r\nSkills & Qualities I'm Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nThe #1 quality I need is someone who can watch 5–10 existing videos on a channel and match that editing style independently. I don't want to micromanage every cut.\n\r\n\n\r\nSpecifically:\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong sense of pacing and comedic timing — knowing when to hold on a reaction, when to cut, when to let a \nnt breathe, and how to land a joke\n\r\nAbility to emulate an already established editing style by studying existing content — not imposing your own creative preferences\n\r\nResourceful b-roll sourcing — you can find relevant, appropriate visuals quickly without being told exactly what to search for\n\r\nBasic color correction skills\n\r\nComfortable with basic transitions — clean and intentional, nothing flashy\n\r\nSelf-directed work ethic — you study the training materials, ask smart questions when something is unclear, and deliver work that doesn't require heavy revision\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I Provide\n\r\n\n\r\nDetailed training recordings — I have multi-hour screen recordings showing my complete editing process for both short-form and long-form content, start to finish. These cover everything: how I select clips from streams, how I pace edits, how I handle captions, how I source b-roll, and the specific style choices that matter. Additional training recordings will be added as we work together.\n\r\nStyle guides and caption specifications — You won't be guessing. The visual style, caption style, and editing approach are documented.\n\r\nClear, specific feedback — If something needs adjustment, I'll tell you exactly what and why. I don't expect perfection on day one, but I do expect quick improvement and consistent effort to match the established style. To confirm you've read this far, please include the word \"mangoes\" somewhere in your application message.\n\r\nExample content — Before you start any edit, I will provide reference videos so you can see exactly what the finished product should look and feel like.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Payment\n\r\n\n\r\n$600–$1,000/month USD depending on experience, skill level, and weekly workload. Higher pay for editors who can handle more volume independently and deliver work that requires minimal revision.\n\r\n\n\r\nPayment schedule: Weekly, paid after each week of completed work. This is standard practice — you work, I review, I pay. No upfront payment required from either side. After the first 1–2 months, we can transition to biweekly or monthly if we both prefer.\n\r\n\n\r\nPayment method: EasyPay (Payoneer), PayPal, or Wise — we can discuss what works best for you.\n\r\nThis is a long-term position with room to grow in both scope and compensation as my business takes on new clients.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply (Follow These Steps Exactly)\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Use exactly 10 Apply Points when submitting your application. Applications with any other number of points will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Send a link to your portfolio OR 2–3 samples of short-form video content you've edited (YouTube Shorts, Reels, TikToks, etc.). Bonus points if any samples include b-roll that you sourced yourself.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Confirm that you have access to Adobe Premiere Pro, Descript (or willingness to get it), and a stock footage platform\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Confirm you are comfortable editing right-leaning American political commentary content.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate your ability to understand heavily accented American English? Be honest — this will be tested during the trial.\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Briefly describe your process when you're given a new channel to edit for — how do you learn and match the style?\n\r\n\n\r\n7. Do you have any experience with AI image or video generation tools? If yes, which ones?\n\r\n\n\r\nHiring Process\n\r\n\n\r\nSelected applicants will receive a paid test task ($15–$25) before any ongoing commitment is made. You'll edit one real short-form video so we can both evaluate whether the fit is right. This test is paid regardless of outcome.                ",

Our flagship products, like the NordStick and NordBench Pro, are affordable, high-quality, and multifunctional, empowering over 250,000 customers to build strength and improve mobility without a gym. As part of a fast-growing DTC fitness ecosystem, we're committed to making health and wellness accessible. This is not a lifestyle brand—it's a long-term company with high expectations around execution, ownership, and reliability.\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nWe are hiring a Senior Customer Service Agent to lead and execute customer support efforts at NordStick. This position is based in the Philippines, with fully remote work and flexible hours to accommodate time zone differences (aligned with US Eastern Time for collaboration).\n\r\nThis is not an entry-level support role. You are not here to just answer tickets. You are here to own customer satisfaction, reduce friction in the support process, and ensure our service scales with growth.\n\r\nYou will operate across customer service, ecommerce systems, data analysis, and cross-functional coordination. You will handle escalations, mentor juniors, and drive improvements. You will be trusted with real responsibility.\n\r\nIf you wait for issues to escalate, this role will be painful. If you spot trends early and implement fixes proactively, you will thrive.\n\r\nThis is a full-time role focused primarily on customer service, with involvement in data-driven insights and partner coordination to enhance the overall customer experience.\n\r\nCore Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomer Service Leadership and Execution\n\r\nLead handling of complex customer inquiries via Rich Panel and other platforms, resolving issues related to orders, shipping, products, returns, and feedback.\n\r\nMentor junior agents, provide training on best practices, and ensure consistent high-quality responses.\n\r\nAnalyze customer interactions to identify patterns, pain points, and opportunities for product or process improvements.\n\r\nEscalate critical issues to leadership and follow through on resolutions.\n\r\n\n\r\nEcommerce and Systems Support\n\r\nOptimize customer journeys on Shopify, including troubleshooting integrations and QA for support-related features.\n\r\nSupport setup, QA, and usage of tools like Rich Panel for CS, Klaviyo for post-purchase communications, and other DTC tools.\n\r\nLeverage AI tools for automating responses, sentiment analysis, and efficient ticket routing.\n\r\nFlag and resolve system issues that impact customer experience before they become widespread problems.\n\r\n\n\r\nData Analysis and Reporting\n\r\nMaintain and update Google Sheets for tracking CS metrics, such as response times, resolution rates, NPS, and customer feedback trends.\n\r\nUse data insights to generate reports and recommend strategies for reducing support volume through proactive measures (e.g., FAQ updates, self-service tools).\n\r\nCollaborate with marketing and operations teams to align CS data with broader business goals.\n\r\n\n\r\nRelationship and Process Management\n\r\nManage relationships with vendors and partners involved in fulfillment, shipping, or support escalations.\n\r\nDevelop and document workflows for efficient CS operations, including escalation protocols and knowledge bases.\n\r\nAct as a central point for CS coordination, preparing summaries for team check-ins and ensuring clear communication.\n\r\nDrive initiatives to improve customer retention through personalized follow-ups and loyalty programs.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\r\nWithin 30 Days\n\r\n\n\r\nCS operations run smoothly with reduced response times and no preventable escalations.\n\r\nSystems and tools are optimized for efficiency.\n\r\nInitial data reports highlight key trends, and basic improvements are implemented.\n\r\n\n\r\nWithin 90 Days\n\r\n\n\r\nCS feels proactive and data-driven, with measurable improvements in satisfaction metrics.\n\r\nTeam communication is tight, and processes are streamlined.\n\r\nLeadership can focus on growth strategy, not day-to-day CS cleanup.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nYou should not apply unless most of the following are true:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou have led or senior-level experience in customer service for DTC ecommerce companies.\n\r\nYou are extremely organized, detail-oriented, and empathetic with customers.\n\r\nYou are proactive, comfortable handling escalations, and making judgment calls.\n\r\nYou communicate clearly, directly, and professionally.\n\r\nYou have hands-on experience with Shopify, Rich Panel, Klaviyo, and Google Sheets.\n\r\nYou are skilled in data analysis, using AI tools for CS optimization, and managing vendor relationships.\n\r\nYou understand DTC ecommerce deeply, including how CS integrates with marketing, operations, and customer journeys.\n\r\nYou can commit full-time, working 40 hours per week, based in the Philippines (with flexibility for US time zone overlap).\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're passionate about fitness, customer success, and elevating service in a dynamic DTC environment, apply today!

    "description": "\n                    We're Launching a SaaS. Come Build It With Us.\n\r\nSpeakerAgent.AI is a brand-new platform for professional speakers — and we're right on the edge of launch. The dashboard is built. We're in the testing phase. We already have subscribers ready to pay. What we need now is a builder who's ready to jump in the trenches with us, tie up the loose ends, and help us ship this thing.\n\r\nHere's what makes this different from every other dev job posting you'll see today: you won't be writing code by hand. We build with Claude Code and Vercel v0 — AI tools that handle 90%+ of the actual coding and development work. Your job is to manage the process, direct the tools, and make sure what comes out the other end actually works and ships.\n\r\nThink of it as being a technical project manager who also gets their hands dirty. You point the AI in the right direction, review what it builds, test it, fix what's broken, and keep the project moving forward.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\nRight Now (Launch Phase)\n\r\n\n\r\nJump into our existing codebase and get familiar with what we've already built\n\r\nWork alongside the founder to knock out the remaining features and fixes before launch\n\r\nTest, debug, and polish the platform for paying customers\n\r\nHelp manage the deployment pipeline (we use Vercel)\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter Launch (Growth Phase)\n\r\n\n\r\nBuild new features based on customer feedback and our product roadmap\n\r\nOptimize performance, fix bugs, and keep the platform stable\n\r\nHelp implement integrations with third-party tools and services\n\r\nTake increasing ownership of the technical side of the product\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-Term (Leadership Phase)\n\r\n\n\r\nGrow into the CTO role — this is the first and hopefully only person we hire for this track\n\r\nOwn the technical vision and architecture of the platform\n\r\nEventually have a compensation package and equity/partnership opportunity that reflects your value\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We're Looking For\n\r\nWe're being intentionally open with this role because the AI tools do the heavy lifting. That said, here's what will put you at the top of our list:\n\r\nStrong Candidates Will Have:\n\r\n\n\r\nSome development experience (even self-taught counts — show us what you've built)\n\r\nFamiliarity with Next.js, React, or modern JavaScript frameworks\n\r\nExperience with any AI coding tools — Claude Code, Claude Cowork, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.\n\r\nComfort working in a terminal/command line environment\n\r\nProject management instincts — you can juggle priorities and keep things on track\n\r\n\n\r\nAlso Great:\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience building or maintaining a SaaS product\n\r\nAutomation experience (n8n, Zapier, Make)\n\r\nUnderstanding of APIs, databases, and deployment workflows\n\r\nAny experience with Vercel, Supabase, or similar platforms\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Matters Most:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're not scared of launching something — you thrive in the messy, fast-moving early stages\n\r\nYou can figure things out without someone holding your hand\n\r\nYou enjoy building products, not just completing tickets\n\r\nYou communicate clearly and often — no disappearing acts\n\r\nYou want to grow with a company, not just collect a check\n\r\n\n\r\nIf You Can Prove You're Technical and Pass Our Assessment, We'll Work With You — even if your resume doesn't check every box. Mindset and ability to learn with AI tools matters more than years of traditional experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n$5–$10/hour USD to start — your pay grows as the platform grows\n\r\nAll AI tools provided — Claude Code, Claude Cowork, and everything you need\n\r\nExact processes and systems — we don't throw you in blind, you'll have clear playbooks to follow\n\r\nDirect path to CTO — prove yourself over 6–12 months and step into an executive role\n\r\nPartnership opportunity — the right person will eventually have a stake in the business\n\r\nReal product, real customers — this isn't a side project. Subscribers are ready. We're launching.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Interview Process\n\r\n\n\r\nReply to this ad — Send an\n to \n with the subject line \"SpeakerAgent.AI\"\n\r\nYou'll receive an automatic reply with next steps, including:\n\r\n\n\r\nA link to book your first interview with Justin\n\r\nA short assessment to complete before your first interview\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nInterview 1 — We'll talk through your experience, walk through your assessment, and see if there's a fit\n\r\nInterview 2 — A deeper dive into the product and how you'd work with us day-to-day (unless we're so impressed in round 1 that we move faster)\n\r\n\n\r\nThe assessment matters. It's not long — but it tells us whether you follow instructions, pay attention to detail, and actually engage with the process. Those qualities matter more than a stacked resume.\n\r\n\n\r\nReady to Build Something Real?\n\r\nIf you're technical, motivated, and excited about the idea of launching a SaaS from the ground floor with a real team and real customers — send us that\n.\n\r\n: \n\r\nSubject Line: SpeakerAgent.AI\n\r\nWe're not looking for perfect. We're looking for hungry. Let's build.                ",

    "description": "\n                    ABOUT US:\n\r\nWe are a well-established e-commerce company with over 10 years of success in the baby products niche, specializing in party supplies. Our brand is powered by a growing team of high-achievers who value ownership, honesty, and continuous improvement. Many of our tea\nmbers have been with us for years and grown into bigger roles. For instance, our manager started as a Virtual Assistant through OnlineJobs.ph nearly 5 years ago and has grown into her leadership role. We are committed to helping you succeed and invest in people who want to grow long-term, not just find “another online job.”\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT THE ROLE:\n\r\nWe are looking for a reliable, detail-oriented, and creative full-time Graphic Designer who takes pride in high-quality work. You will work on product images, simple videos, AI-generated visuals, social media creatives, packaging, and light product design. You don’t need to know every tool yet, what matters most is that you are visually creative, eager to learn, and excited to improve every week. You are comfortable working with autonomy, responding to feedback, and you see this role as a chance to grow your skills and build a long-term career with PRIMEPURE.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role offers semi-flexible hours with weekly calls across time zones and day-to-day work done independently.\n\r\n\n\r\nCORE RESPONSIBILITIES:\n\r\n- Edit and enhance product images for our listings and website (cleanups, simple retouching, basic composites).\n\r\n- Create lifestyle images and simple mockups to showcase our products.\n\r\n- Design social media creatives aligned with our brand.\n\r\n- Assist with product packaging layouts and small product design elements.\n\r\n- Create simple marketing assets such as banners,\n graphics, and promotional visuals.\n\r\n- Use AI tools as part of your creative process (for example, to generate ideas, mockups, or variations) and refine outputs for real-world use.\n\r\n- Organize design files and follow our brand guidelines and templates.\n\r\n- Communicate clearly with the team in writing and on calls, sharing progress and asking smart questions when truly needed.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\r\n- Strong visual sense and creativity: You care about aesthetics, composition, and clear visual communication.\n\r\n- Basic experience with at least one design tool (e.g., Canva, Photoshop, Illustrator, or similar).\n\r\n- Willingness and excitement to learn Photoshop and Illustrator with our guidance.\n\r\n- Highly organized: Strong attention to detail and ability to manage multiple design tasks.\n\r\n- Self-motivated and autonomous: You set mini-deadlines, move work forward without reminders, and keep your commitments.\n\r\n- Research-first mindset: You look for tutorials, inspiration, and examples before asking the team.\n\r\n- Eager to learn: You actively look for feedback, new tools, and better ways to work.\n\r\n\n\r\nDESIRED SKILLS (preferred but not required):\n\r\n- Familiarity with e-commerce or product-based brands (Amazon, Shopify, etc.).\n\r\n- Experience with short-form video editing (reels, TikToks, simple product videos).\n\r\n- Experience creating packaging, labels, or print-ready files.\n\r\n- Experience using tools like Asana, Slack, or similar project-management/communication platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\nBENEFITS:\n\r\n- 100% remote work.\n\r\n- Competitive salary with opportunities for performance-based increases up to twice per year.\n\r\n- Internet bill coverage.\n\r\n- Long-term growth opportunities in a stable, fast-moving company.\n\r\n- Access to training resources and a supportive leadership team that wants you to succeed.\n\r\n\n\r\nNOTE ABOUT USE OF AI:\n\r\nWe actively use and encourage AI tools in our day-to-day work, and we see them as a powerful way to work smarter. However, during the hiring process we ask that you complete all application questions and exercises yourself, without AI assistance. We genuinely want to get to know the real YOU, not a \"perfectly polished, robotic answer\" you. Don’t worry about sentence structure or grammar; what matters to us is the substance of your answers and the honesty behind them. If we believe AI has been used to generate your responses, your application will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY (READ CAREFULLY):\n\r\n- Use this\n subject line exactly: \"I will not use AI\"\n\r\n- At the very top of your\n body, before anything else, write this sentence exactly: \"Hello PRIMEPURE team, I pay attention to small details\"\n\r\n- In the rest of the\n body, in a few short sentences, answer these two questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. What would you want us to remember about you after reading 100 applications? Feel free to attach your portfolio here.\n\r\n2. What are your salary expectations for this position (per month in USD)?\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that do not follow these few simple instructions will sadly not be considered. If shortlisted, you’ll receive an\n from Anna with instructions on the next steps. Thank you for your time, and best of luck!                ",
