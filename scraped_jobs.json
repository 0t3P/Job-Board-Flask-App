    "description": "\n                    Make sure you read this in full before applying:\n\r\n\n\r\nLet me guess... You're the sharpest SEO mind in the room. But you're suffocating.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're tired of presenting killer audit findings that get buried in a developer's \"backlog.\" You’re tired of keyword-stuffed nonsense, begging for tool budgets, and explaining a 301 redirect to your boss for the tenth time.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't just another job post. This is your exit strategy.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re not offering you a new title. We’re offering you a war room, an arsenal, and the targets to prove how good you really are.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho Are We?\n\r\nMy name is Jim Ng. I built this agency on one principle: get clients tangible results, or get out of the way. \n\r\nIn just a year, we've delivered for over 50 businesses. Now, we have a clear, audacious mission: to 10x our revenue in the next 12 months.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn’t a \"hope and pray\" strategy. It’s a battle plan. We need elite \"Digital Warriors\" who don't just \"do SEO\"—they command the search results.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Stakes: We Put Our Skin in the Game\n\r\nWe don’t hide behind \"SEO takes time\" excuses. We offer our clients iron-clad guarantees:\n\r\n\n\r\n- 10% of targeted keywords on Page 1 in 3 months.\n\r\n- 30% of targeted keywords on Page 1 in 6 months.\n\r\n- 60% of targeted keywords on Page 1 in 12 months.\n\r\n\n\r\nDoes this scare you, or does it excite you? If your first thought is \"That's impossible,\" keep scrolling. If your first thought is \"With my strategy and AI-driven efficiency, I can crush those numbers,\" then you’re the sniper we want.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Actually Be Doing (The Blueprint)\n\r\n- Architect of Success: You won't just advise on site structure; you’ll build the SEO Bible for our clients. You have the authority to see changes implemented.\n\r\n- AI Command & Control: You use AI models not as a crutch, but as an exoskeleton. You engineer complex prompts to automate audits, generate schema at scale, and dismantle competitor strategies piece by piece.\n\r\n- The Sherlock Holmes of Search: You conduct deep-dive technical, content, and backlink audits. You find the opportunities that Screaming Frog and Ahrefs miss because you know how to look beneath the data.\n\r\n- Translate Data into Dollars: You live in GA4 and Search Console. You ignore vanity metrics. Your focus is singular: qualified organic traffic that drives business growth.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Specialist’s Code (Is This You?)\n\r\n- Growth & Mastery: You have 3+ years in the trenches. You see a Google Update as an opportunity to leapfrog the competition, not a crisis.\n\r\n- Technical Dominance: You speak \"developer.\" You understand CMS limitations, cloud hosting, and how to work with technical teams to get it right the first time.\n\r\n- AI Power User: You are well-adept in prompt engineering. You know how to use AI to 10x your own output and accuracy.\n\r\n- Future Leader: You want to be in a commanding position. You aren't looking for a job to hide in; you're looking for a platform to lead and eventually run your own pod.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Real Pay-Off\n\r\n- Unleashed Autonomy: You get the freedom to test, experiment, and implement. This is your domain to master.\n\r\n- Remote Warfare: This is a 100% remote role. We care about the traffic graph moving up and to the right, not what chair you sit in.\n\r\n- No Nightmare Clients: We protect our warriors. If a client won't implement your expert recommendations, we fire them.\n\r\n- Empire Building: You are part of the core team. Your successes will be highly visible and critical to our 10x mission.\n\r\n\n\r\nReady to Enlist? Here’s where you can apply:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNothing else will be entertained.                ",

We are small team at present with 2 of our team also from the Philippines, but we plan to grow rapidly and need to build an exciting, passionate team.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role exists to ensure every project is technically correct, clearly documented, and ready for smooth installation. You will work closely with sales, installers, and customer service to make sure the right products are selected, job packs are accurate, and technical details are never missed.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will not be responsible for full system design from scratch. Instead, your role is to validate, refine, and optimise proposals created in OpenSolar.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will play a key role in ensuring technical excellence and freeing up leadership to focus on growth.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Core Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\n1?? Technical Job Pack Ownership\n\r\n- Review and refine job packs before installation.  \n\r\n- Ensure installers receive clear, detailed, and practical instructions.  \n\r\n- Identify missing details, risks, or inconsistencies.  \n\r\n- Improve job pack quality and technical clarity across all projects.  \n\r\n- Translate sales outcomes into installation-ready technical information.\n\r\n\n\r\n2?? OpenSolar Proposal Review & Technical Optimisation\n\r\nUsing OpenSolar, you will:\n\r\n- Review proposals built by the team and ensure technical accuracy.  \n\r\n- Adjust configurations where needed to align with real-world installation requirements.  \n\r\n- Validate system sizing, product selection, and compatibility.  \n\r\n- Ensure pricing and technical recommendations align with customer needs.  \n\r\n- Work with sales to deliver technically sound solutions quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role focuses on technical oversight and optimisation rather than full system design.\n\r\n\n\r\n3?? Product Selection & Technical Expertise\n\r\nA core part of this role is having an in-depth understanding of solar and battery products, knowing which solution suits which scenario.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with products such as:\n\r\n- Tesla Powerwall  \n\r\n- SunGrow  \n\r\n- GoodWe  \n\r\n- Selectronic  \n\r\n- Sigenergy  \n\r\n- RedEarth  \n\r\n\n\r\nYou should understand:\n\r\n- Which products suit different customer goals.  \n\r\n- Compatibility between inverters, batteries, and system layouts.  \n\r\n- Strengths and limitations of different brands.  \n\r\n- Practical installation considerations.\n\r\n\n\r\n4?? Installer Liaison & Technical Assurance\n\r\n- Act as the technical bridge between office and field teams.  \n\r\n- Liaise with installers to confirm correct setup and execution.  \n\r\n- Answer technical questions and remove uncertainty before installation.  \n\r\n- Help maintain consistent installation standards.\n\r\n\n\r\n5?? Technical Support & Problem Solving\n\r\n- Support customer service with technical troubleshooting.  \n\r\n- Help diagnose and resolve client issues efficiently.  \n\r\n- Communicate technical information clearly to non-technical people.  \n\r\n- Ensure customers receive confident and professional technical support.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Ideal Candidate\n\r\nYou are someone who:\n\r\n- Naturally catches details others miss.  \n\r\n- Understands solar systems beyond software outputs.  \n\r\n- Knows how to choose the right product for the right scenario.  \n\r\n- Thinks practically about real-world installs.  \n\r\n- Enjoys improving systems and reducing mistakes.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Required Skills & Experience\n\r\n- Strong experience using OpenSolar (reviewing and refining proposals).  \n\r\n- Solid understanding of solar + battery system operation.  \n\r\n- Deep knowledge of major inverter and battery ecosystems.  \n\r\n- Experience preparing or reviewing technical documentation/job packs.  \n\r\n- Ability to communicate effectively with installers and sales teams.  \n\r\n- Strong troubleshooting mindset.\n\r\n\n\r\n? Highly Desirable\n\r\n- Hybrid or off-grid knowledge.  \n\r\n- Electrification knowledge (EV charging, heat pumps, etc.).  \n\r\n- Experience improving operational workflows.  \n\r\n- Field installation or commissioning experience.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Success in This Role Looks Like\n\r\n- Job packs are extremely clear and detailed.  \n\r\n- Installers are confident and rarely need clarification.  \n\r\n- Product selections are optimised for each situation.  \n\r\n- Technical issues are solved quickly.  \n\r\n- Sales moves faster because technical decisions are validated early.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Who Will Thrive In This Role\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who genuinely enjoys technical accuracy and takes pride in getting things right the first time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will likely succeed in this role if you:\n\r\n- Notice details that others miss.  \n\r\n- Think ahead and prevent problems before they happen.  \n\r\n- Care about quality and long-term outcomes — not just completing tasks.  \n\r\n- Enjoy improving systems and making things clearer and smoother.  \n\r\n- Are comfortable taking ownership rather than waiting for instructions.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a role for someone who wants to simply follow a checklist.  \n\r\nIt is a role for someone who wants to become the trusted technical right hand in a growing solar                ",

We build together.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe design systems that still make sense 12 months from now, not quick fixes that break next quarter.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Do\n\r\n- You'll be hands-on building backend systems, primarily in Zoho CRM\n\r\n\n\r\nThat includes:\n\r\n- Building CRM modules and layouts\n\r\n- Creating and maintaining workflow rules\n\r\n- Supporting automation logic\n\r\n- Creating forms, structured data flows, dashboards\n\r\n- Troubleshooting broken processes and identifying root causes\n\r\n- Documenting clearly\n\r\n- Exploring new tools as projects evolve\n\r\n\n\r\nWe like backend thinkers. If something feels inefficient or unclear, you raise it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For\n\r\n- You have hands-on experience building backend systems inside a CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, Zoho, Pipedrive, etc.). That part is non-negotiable.\n\r\n- Zoho CRM experience is strongly preferred, but if you've built clean systems in another CRM and can demonstrate strong backend logic, we're open.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou:\n\r\n- Can build workflow rules independently\n\r\n- Think in systems, not just tasks\n\r\n- Prefer root cause over surface fixes\n\r\n- Document as you go\n\r\n- Stay calm when debugging\n\r\n- Understand backend cause-and-effect\n\r\n\n\r\nIf someone points you to CommandCenter, a new Zoho app, or asks you to build an Excel macro - you won’t freeze. You'll test, experiment, and figure it out.\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus if you've worked with:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Zoho Checkout, Creator, Forms\n\r\n- Zapier or Make\n\r\n- Spreadsheet logic (Excel / Google Sheets)\n\r\n- Google Apps Script\n\r\n\n\r\nEven better if you occasionally say:  “Here’s what I'd suggest instead.” We like people who care enough to think!\n\r\n\n\r\nHow We Work:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Open collaboration\n\r\n- Ownership without ego\n\r\n- Clear communication\n\r\n- Sustainable pace\n\r\n- Serious about good systems, serious about being decent humans\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this sounds like your kind of work, send us your application along with a short 1-2 minute video intro. Tell us about a backend system you built and what you'd improve if you rebuilt it today.                ",

We want your input. If you see a better way to structure something, say it. We're building together.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe build systems that still make sense 12 months from now, not quick fixes that break next quarter.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Do\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be hands-on inside Zoho CRM.\n\r\n\n\r\nThat includes:\n\r\n- Building CRM modules and layouts\n\r\n- Creating and maintaining workflow rules\n\r\n- Supporting automation logic\n\r\n- Creating forms and structured data flows\n\r\n- Troubleshooting broken processes and identifying root causes\n\r\n- Documenting clearly\n\r\n- Learning new Zoho tools as projects evolve\n\r\n\n\r\nWe value builders who think, not just follow instructions. If something feels off, unclear, or unnecessarily complicated - speak up.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For:\n\r\nYou have hands-on Zoho CRM experience.\n\r\nYou can build workflow rules independently.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're technical enough to tinker. If someone points you to CommandCenter or a new Zoho app, or asks you to create an Excel macro, you won't freeze - you’ll test, read, experiment, and figure it out.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou probably:\n\r\nThink in systems, not just tasks\n\r\nPrefer solving the root cause over quick fixes\n\r\nDocument as you go\n\r\nStay calm when debugging\n\r\nEnjoy understanding how backend pieces connect\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus if you've worked with:\n\r\nZoho Checkout, Creator, Forms\n\r\nZapier or Make\n\r\nSpreadsheet logic (Excel/Google Sheets)\n\r\nGoogle Apps Script\n\r\nEven better if you occasionally say: “Here's what I'd suggest instead.” - We like people who care enough to think!\n\r\n\n\r\nHow We Work:\n\r\n- We collaborate openly\n\r\n- We care about mental health and sustainability\n\r\n- We value ownership without ego\n\r\n- We solve problems calmly\n\r\n- We don't expect perfection, but we do expect clarity\n\r\n- We're serious about good systems\n\r\n- We're also serious about being decent humans\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this sounds like you, we'd love to hear from you. Send us your application along with a short 1-2 minute video intro telling us a bit about your experience and how you approach backend problems.                ",

Our shorts should feel cinematic, elegant, hypnotic, visceral, and expensive. (Be prepared to innovate as demands and trends change.)\n\r\nYou will receive scripts, AI tool access, and style references. Your job is to build the scene: generate AI visuals, source archival footage, layer sound design, add voiceover from elevenlabs, and deliver shorts where every second earns the next.\n\r\nWe are hiring for taste, cinematic instinct, and the ability to treat AI generation as a serious production tool.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE STYLE\n\r\nMultiple styles as demand and trends change; Dark luxury. Museum. Stylish and lethal. Rich textures. Controlled palette. Both silence and impact used with intention. Every cut has a reason.\n\r\nNot: default presets, stock photo slideshows.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\nProduce vertical shorts (YouTube Shorts / TikTok / Reels) end-to-end using our scripts, style kits, and current channel benchmarks:\n\r\n\n\r\nEdit: Assemble 30-120s vertical shorts with elegant pacing and restraint. The voiceover leads — visuals serve. You know when to let a line breathe and when to accelerate.\n\r\nGenerate: Create supporting visuals using AI image and video tools (Seedream, Veo, Kling, and whatever launches next). We provide all paid accounts and internal prompting workflows — you bring creative judgment and iteration speed.\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Beat-matching, swells, drops, and silence to drive visual storytelling. You understand rhythm as an editing tool — not decoration.\n\r\nProduct Integration: Place static jewelry photos into moving scenes so they look physically present — masking, light/shadow matching, subtle color grading. Convincing realism, not floating stickers. (AI can handle lot of this, but requires a good eye for it.)\n\r\nFinish: Minimal kinetic typography + copyright-safe or licensed classical/atmospheric audio (Generated via Suno).\n\r\nFile Hygiene: Clean bin structure, naming conventions. Project files and assets uploaded Notion/\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCORE REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Eye. You instinctively know the difference between luxury and cheap. Starting out, you'll receive reference videos of our current benchmarks and experimental formats. Your job is to match that standard consistently and innovate on top of them.\n\r\nVoiceover-First Storytelling. You edit to narration first, music second. You never bury a punchline under a flashy transition.\n\r\nRetention Instinct. The first frame is an ad for the second frame. You know what stops a scroll. You build hooks visually. Every 2–3 seconds, something changes.\n\r\nAI Fluency. You're comfortable generating, iterating, and curating AI output across image and video tools. You treat generation as production — prompting, reviewing, selecting, and refining until the output meets the standard.\n\r\nAdobe Premiere Pro. Required for project handoffs and consistency.\n\r\nStrong English. Daily async communication — clear, direct, and professional.\n\r\nReliable & Coachable. You hit deadlines or warn early. You take direct feedback and iterate fast. You flag problems with options, not excuses.\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus (not required, but noticed):\n\r\nAfter Effects compositing, Mocha tracking, advanced color grading, sound design beyond music (SFX layering, risers, hits).\n\r\n\n\r\nVOLUME & DELIVERABLES\n\r\n\n\r\nRamp-up (first 2–3 weeks): 2–3 shorts/week as you learn the brand voice and pipeline\n\r\nSteady state: Push to 4 high quality vertical shorts per week.\n\r\nDeliverables: 1080×1920 minimum, 30fps, MP4 (H.264)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nRAM: 16GB minimum (32GB preferred) + SSD\n\r\nReliable high-speed internet (upload speed matters)\n\r\nMust run Premiere Pro and browser-based AI tools simultaneously without issue\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPAID TRIAL (Shortlisted Candidates)\n\r\nBefore any full-time commitment, we run a paid weekly trial. We provide scripts, elevenlabs access for voiceover, and style references/benchmarks. You deliver 30–50 second shorts. Trial is compensated at $250 USD at the end of each week. If it's a mutual fit after 30 days, we transition to bi-weekly payments of $550 (before work).\n\r\nThis protects both sides — you see whether the work fits your strengths, we see whether the output fits our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\r\n\n\r\nPaid accounts for all frontier AI tools\n\r\nCreative identity — you're building the visual language of a brand from launch, not filling someone else's template\n\r\nClear briefs — scripts, audio files, mood boards, and reference videos for every batch\n\r\nDirect feedback — specific, constructive notes on every edit\n\r\nA brand worth building — Prismiera launches soon, with a second and third AI-native brands after that, which cover a wide variety of content scopes. You're helping build the machine.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nOWNERSHIP & CONFIDENTIALITY\n\r\nAll outputs (edits, project files, prompts, generated assets) are Prismiera property and must remain confidential. \n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nImportant: Use at least 7 Apply Points when applying on OnlineJobs.ph.\n\r\nSubject line: PRISMIERA EDITOR — [Your Favorite Historical Art Era]\n\r\nSend only the following (numbered exactly):\n\r\n\n\r\nPortfolio. Links to your 3 best vertical shorts (mood/atmosphere preferred — not vlogs). Label one that demonstrates music-driven pacing.\n\r\nThe Story Test. Link to ONE short that includes voiceover or spoken dialogue. We need to see that you can pace visuals to a script. (Can overlap with #1.)\n\r\nLuxury Test (3–5 bullets). How do you make an edit feel \"expensive\" instead of \"cheap\"?\n\r\nAI Experience (1–2 sentences). What is your experience level with generative AI tools? If none, say so — we'll evaluate the rest on its own merits.\n\r\nTechnical (exactly 3 sentences). Describe your approach to compositing a static product photo into a moving scene so it looks physically present.\n\r\nSpecs. PC specs (CPU / GPU / RAM / SSD) + internet upload speed (screenshot preferred).\n\r\nIntegrity (1–2 sentences). Describe a time you missed a deadline or made a mistake — what did you do next?\n\r\nThe Rewrite. Rewrite this sentence in a cinematic tone: \"She is really cool and strong and she wins.\"                ",

The Avatar must be generated based on one of the following specifications:\n\r\n   -An avatar generated to look like the original speaker\n\r\n\n\r\n-Visual Enhancement (AI B-Roll): Generate new video clips (B-roll) using text prompts. These AI clips must be seamlessly edited over the speaker's footage to enhance the narrative.\n\r\n  \n\r\n-Final Delivery: Provide the final, high-resolution MP4 video file and a folder containing all original source files and all generated AI assets as the pilot and if successful for each video thereafter.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n3.

Documentary style with AI-generated visuals.\n\r\nI need someone who can take my scripts and turn them into finished, cinematic YouTube videos using AI video tools — primarily Google Veo3 (or similar tools like Runway, Kling, etc.)\n\r\nI handle all scripting. You handle everything else: AI video generation, editing, pacing, music, sound design, and final delivery.\n\r\nThis is NOT traditional video editing. You won't be cutting raw camera footage. You'll be creating visuals from scratch using AI prompts, then assembling them into a polished, cinematic video.\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL ACTUALLY DO (real talk)\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nYour typical week:\n\r\n? You receive 15 scripts with visual instructions fro\n\r\n? For each script, you generate AI video clips using Veo3 (or similar tools)\n\r\n? You edit everything together: AI clips + stock footage + music + sound effects\n\r\n? You maintain consistent pacing, narrative structure, and cinematic feel\n\r\n? You deliver 15 finished videos per week (60/month total)\n\r\nEach video is 15-25 minutes long, documentary/storytelling style.\n\r\nTools you'll use:\n\r\n\n\r\nGoogle Veo3 (primary AI video generation — I provide access)\n\r\nCapCut, Premiere Pro, or DaVinci Resolve (editing)\n\r\nStock footage sources (Pexels, Pixabay — I'll guide you)\n\r\nGoogle Drive / Dropbox (file sharing)\n\r\nSlack or\n (communication)\n\r\n\n\r\nOutput expected:\n\r\n\n\r\n60 finished videos per month (15/week)\n\r\nConsistent quality across all videos\n\r\nEach video ready to upload — no additional editing needed fro\n\r\n\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nSTYLE REFERENCE — THIS IS WHAT YOUR WORK SHOULD LOOK LIKE\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWatch these channels carefully. This is the quality, pacing, and storytelling level I expect:\n\r\n? \n\r\n? \n\r\n? \n\r\n? \n/channel/UCSD1CZO5lg5O4FNBmbi15Mw\n\r\nKey style elements:\n\r\n\n\r\nDocumentary / educational storytelling\n\r\nStrong hooks in the first 30 seconds\n\r\nAI-generated visuals blended with stock footage\n\r\nProfessional sound design (music + ambient effects)\n\r\nClean, cinematic editing — no flashy transitions, no \n edits\n\r\nStructured narrative that keeps viewers watching\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you watch those channels and think \"I can do this\" — keep reading.\n\r\nIf you watch them and feel lost — this isn't for you. No hard feelings.\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWHO YOU ARE (must-haves)\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\n You have real experience with AI video generation tools (Veo3, Runway, Kling, Pika, or similar)\n\r\n You can write effective AI prompts that produce cinematic, consistent results\n\r\n You understand narrative structure — you know how to pace a 20-minute story\n\r\n You can edit 10+ minute long-form videos (not TikToks, not Reels — real YouTube content)\n\r\n You use music and sound effects strategically, not randomly\n\r\n You work independently — I send you a script, you deliver a finished video\n\r\n You suggest creative improvements instead of just following instructions blindly\n\r\n NOT a fit if:\n\r\n? You've never used AI video tools (this is not a training position)\n\r\n? You only do short-form content (under 5 minutes)\n\r\n? You need step-by-step instructions for every single scene\n\r\n? You can't handle feedback or revisions\n\r\n? You disappear for days without communication\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWHAT YOU GET\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\n Pay: Starting at $400/month\n\r\n? If your quality is consistently high, salary increases. This is not a ceiling, it's a starting point.\n\r\n? Top performer can realistically reach $\n/month within 3-6 months.\n\r\n Volume: 60 videos/month (15/week)\n\r\n Location: Remote, any timezone (but deadlines are deadlines)\n\r\n Growth: I'm scaling to more channels. Good work = more work = more pay.\n\r\n Start: This week if you're ready\n\r\n Bonus: This is a long-term position. I'm not looking for a one-month freelancer. I want someone who grows with the channels.\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY (read this carefully — seriously)\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nDO NOT send a generic \"I'm interested\" message.\n\r\nI get hundreds of those. They all go straight to trash.\n\r\nInstead, do this:\n\r\n Write the word \"GLACIER\" at the very top of your message.\n\r\n? This proves you actually read the whole post. No GLACIER = I won't read your application.\n\r\n Send me at least one longer video (8+ minutes) that YOU personally edited.\n\r\n? Bonus points if it uses AI-generated visuals.\n\r\n? If you don't have a long-form sample, don't apply.\n\r\n Briefly explain:\n\r\n? What software do you use for editing?\n\r\n? What's your experience with AI video tools? (Which ones? How long?)\n\r\n? How do you approach structuring a long-form video from a script?\n\r\n Watch one of the reference channels above and tell me:\n\r\n? What do they do well?\n\r\n? What would you do differently?\n\r\n Applications without \"GLACIER\" at the top = automatically ignored. No exceptions.\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWHY WORK WITH ME?\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nHonest truth:\n\r\n I pay on time, every month. No chasing, no excuses.\n\r\n I give clear, specific feedback — not vague \"make it better\" nonsense.\n\r\n Steady, consistent work — not a random one-off project.\n\r\n I handle all the scripting — you focus purely on the visual/editing side.\n\r\n Room to grow as channels scale.\n\r\n I'm picky about quality. If pacing is off, I'll ask for revisions.\n\r\n Volume is real — 60 videos/month means you need to be efficient.\n\r\n I expect communication — if something is delayed, tell me before the deadline, not after.\n\r\nIf you understand structure, pacing, AI tools, and storytelling — we can build something long-term together.\n\r\nIf this sounds like you, apply now.\n\r\nIf not, no hard feelings — save us both the time.\n\r\nGeorge                ",

I haven't launched the website yet, but it's built and ready to go. My Instagram and TikTok presence is CRUCIAL to growing my brand and my own profile as in \"influencer\" in the wellness space. I need someone with impeccable taste, excellent aesthetics, great humour and wit who can understand the brand's voice and create authentic content to really build our presence and influence on socials. Ideally, you'll have experience crafting influencer strategies and organically growing audiences.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities:\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Creation: Transform raw footage/photos (fro\n) into high-end, editorial Reels, Stories, and Posts on TikTok and Instagram (~5x per week).\n\r\n\n\r\nSocial Management: Manage the grid, write witty/grounded captions, and engage with the community on Instagram and TikTok.\n\r\n\n\r\nWeb &\n: Light editing on our Squarespace site (posting recipes and content), and managing our\n newsletter (sharing recipes, tips, and updates).\n\r\n\n\r\nBrand Voice: Protect the \"Well-ish\" philosophy.

You LOVE AI or have a strong curiosity for how to apply this to your work.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Aesthetically driven: You're the type who would obsess about the right shade of blue, you have an eye for high-end design. You understand when something looks right based on basic design and compositional rules. You are able to  use the Well-ish brand guidelines in creating posts.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Growth Mindset: You understand lead generation (how to turn a follower into a newsletter subscriber or coaching client). You have the stats to prove it.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Long-term Vision: This starts as a part-time contract but is designed to grow into a full-time, high-responsibility role as the company scales.

Our goal is to reduce manual triage and ensure high-value leads reach our salesperson quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\nTechnical Environment:\n\r\nChannels: FB, IG, TikTok,\n, and 2x WhatsApp Lite numbers.\n\r\nCurrent State: Pipelines are built; customers are imported; basic templates are in use.\n\r\nImmediate Need: Salesbot logic to automate \"Education & Encouragement\" flows and lead movement.\n\r\n\n\r\nPriority & Logic Requirements\n\r\nWe have ranked our needs by priority. Please specify how many of these flows you can build within the $500 budget:\n\r\n\n\r\nPriority 1: INDIVIDUALS (High Volume Triage)\n\r\nGoal: Automate \"Education & Encouragement\" via bot.\n\r\nLogic: Provide a \"Free Join\" link for our directory.

We help users understand what drives long-term value in digital assets through transparent scoring methodologies, analytical tools, and in-depth educational content.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are an independent startup preparing for public launch. We answer to our users, not outside investors, which means every decision is driven by what makes the product better, not what makes a boardroom happy. You can see our pre-launch page at \n.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a ground-floor opportunity to shape a product's marketing strategy from day one. If you have ever wanted to build something from scratch rather than maintain what someone else built, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for a Growth Marketer and Social Media Manager who can help us build a loyal, engaged audience and convert that attention into paying subscribers after our public launch. This is not a \"schedule some posts and call it a day\" role. We need someone who thinks strategically about funnels, conversions, and audience building, and who can also execute the day-to-day content and community management that makes it all work.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be the driving force behind our social media presence across multiple platforms. You will collaborate closely with the TVR team on content creation and platform selection, gradually taking on more ownership as you become familiar with our product and voice.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES: GROWTH MARKETING & SOCIAL MEDIA\n\r\n\n\r\n- Help develop and execute a social media growth strategy across multiple platforms (helping identify which platforms are the best fit for our audience is part of the role)\n\r\n- Help create, schedule, and publish engaging content that drives traffic to the TVR website (using tools like FeedHive or similar scheduling platforms)\n\r\n- Help build and grow our audience from zero to a thriving community of people interested in cryptocurrency fundamental analysis\n\r\n- Help design a content funnel: social media content that brings visitors to the free site, and nurture strategies that convert free users into paying subscribers\n\r\n- Monitor and respond to comments and engagement across all platforms, filtering out spam and trolls while identifying and nurturing genuine conversations\n\r\n- Track performance metrics (follower growth, engagement rates, click-throughs, conversions) and report on what is working and what is not\n\r\n- Create or source visual content (graphics, short videos, infographics) to support posts\n\r\n- Collaborate with the team on content ideas and contribute to the editorial calendar\n\r\n- Repurpose long-form content (educational articles, coin analyses) into platform-specific social media content. One article should become multiple posts optimized for each platform's format and audience.\n\r\n- Help manage\n marketing campaigns and newsletter content through MailerLite\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSECONDARY RESPONSIBILITIES: VIRTUAL ASSISTANT TASKS\n\r\n\n\r\n- Filter and organize social media replies and messages, flagging items that require a team response\n\r\n- Assist with formatting and uploading content to the website\n\r\n- Help manage the newsletter subscriber list and\n workflows\n\r\n- Light research tasks as needed (competitor analysis, content ideas, trending topics in the space)\n\r\n- General administrative support related to the TVR platform\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nA NOTE ABOUT THIS ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nOur analysis methodology produces results based on measurable fundamentals. Sometimes those results challenge popular opinion within cryptocurrency communities. This means our social media will occasionally attract strong reactions from passionate supporters of specific projects. We see this as an opportunity, not a problem. The right person for this role is someone who can engage professionally with criticism, turn heated \nnts into teaching opportunities, and remain calm and measured when others are not. If you thrive under that kind of challenge, you will love this role.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS\n\r\n\n\r\n- C2 (Advanced/Proficient) English language skills, both written and verbal. This is non-negotiable. You will be writing public-facing content and representing the brand.\n\r\n- At least 1 year of experience managing social media accounts for a business or brand (not personal accounts). You must be able to provide links to accounts you have managed.\n\r\n- Demonstrated ability to grow a social media following and drive measurable engagement (provide at least one example with results)\n\r\n- Strong written communication skills with clean grammar and a professional tone\n\r\n- Experience creating visual content for social media (graphics, short-form video, infographics)\n\r\n- Self-motivated and able to work independently with minimal supervision\n\r\n- Comfortable with weekly video calls for strategy discussions\n\r\n- Comfortable working within detailed brand guidelines and receiving regular feedback on content. We approve all posts before publishing, especially in the early stages, and we need someone who thrives in a collaborative feedback loop rather than resisting it.\n\r\n- Strong proactive communication skills. In a remote, asynchronous environment, we need someone who flags issues, shares updates, and proposes solutions without being asked.\n\r\n- Proficient in using AI tools (such as Claude, Gemini, X.ai, Midjourney, or similar) as part of a professional workflow. We are not looking for casual users. We want someone who actively integrates AI into their work to move faster and produce better results.\n\r\n- Reliable internet connection and a quiet workspace for video calls\n\r\n- Experience with growth marketing, conversion funnels, or\n marketing strategy\n\r\n- Basic graphic design skills (Canva or similar tools)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS (NICE TO HAVE)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Familiarity with cryptocurrency or fintech (you do not need to be an expert, but genuine curiosity about the space is a strong plus)\n\r\n- Experience with social media scheduling tools (FeedHive, Buffer, Hootsuite, or similar)\n\r\n- Experience with\n marketing platforms (MailerLite, Mailchimp, or similar)\n\r\n- Basic video editing skills (for short-form social content)\n\r\n- Experience working with startups or early-stage companies\n\r\n- Experience with Google Analytics or similar web analytics tools (understanding traffic sources, user behavior, and conversion tracking)\n\r\n- Experience building a social media presence from scratch (growing from zero), not just managing established accounts\n\r\n- Basic understanding of SEO principles (keyword awareness, meta descriptions, content structure for search visibility)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSCHEDULE, COMPENSATION & LOGISTICS\n\r\n\n\r\n- Part-time: 20 hours per week (4 hours/day, 5 days/week) with the possibility of increasing to 30-40 hours as the platform grows\n\r\n- Starting pay rate: $6-10+ USD/hour depending on experience and qualifications, with structured milestone raises tied to measurable platform growth. As the platform succeeds, your compensation grows with it. Full details discussed with shortlisted candidates.\n\r\n- The first 2 weeks serve as a mutual trial period for both sides to confirm the fit.\n\r\n- Payment method: Wise\n\r\n- Flexible schedule: Most work can be done on your own time since posts will be scheduled in advance. We do ask for availability during peak engagement hours when possible, and one weekly video strategy call with the team.\n\r\n- This is a contractor position with no tax withholding or benefits requirements\n\r\n- Start date: Late February / Early March 2026\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY JOIN TVR?\n\r\n\n\r\n- Ground-floor opportunity: You will shape the marketing strategy from day one, not inherit someone else's playbook\n\r\n- Growth potential: As the platform scales, so does your role, your hours, and your compensation. We are building this for the long term.\n\r\n- Creative ownership: We want your ideas and your voice, not just your hands on a keyboard\n\r\n- Work with a team that values quality over speed, honesty over hype, and substance over noise\n\r\n- Learn about fintech, data-driven analysis, and the cryptocurrency industry while getting paid to do it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nWe read every application carefully. To help us identify serious candidates, please include ALL FOUR of the following in your application:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. SUBJECT LINE KEYWORD: Include the phrase \"Steady Growth\" somewhere in the subject line of your application. This tells us you read the entire posting.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. PORTFOLIO LINKS: Provide links to at least 2 social media accounts you have managed for a business or brand (not your personal accounts). For each one, include a brief note about the results you achieved (follower growth, engagement metrics, or any other relevant numbers).\n\r\n\n\r\n3.
