This role is for someone who truly understands how to architect, build, and scale advanced GHL systems for real marketing environments. We are not interested in hiring agencies, white-label teams, or outsourced firms. This position is for an individual expert with a proven track record.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is fully remote, but candidates must be available to work consistently during AV / EST business hours. Excellent, near-perfect English communication skills are required, both written and spoken, as you will be collaborating closely with leadership and internal teams on system design and execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs our GoHighLevel Build Expert, you will be responsible for turning marketing strategy into fully functional, scalable GHL systems. This includes designing complete account structures, building funnels and websites inside GoHighLevel, creating and executing advanced workflow automation plans, and implementing API-driven integrations. You will be expected to think in systems, not just features, and to plan automation logic thoroughly before building. Clean structure, clear logic, and long-term maintainability are critical in this role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will regularly build high-converting websites, funnels, and landing pages directly inside GoHighLevel, including forms, surveys, calendars, booking logic, membership areas, and payment flows using Stripe. You should understand how these components work together to support lead generation, appointment setting, onboarding, and fulfillment for marketing clients. Speed, mobile responsiveness, and user experience are expected standards, not afterthoughts.\n\r\n\n\r\nA major part of this role involves workflow strategy and execution. You must be able to design complex automation systems that handle lead intake, pipeline movement, appointment reminders, follow-ups via SMS,\n, voi\n, and AI, internal task assignment, reactivation campaigns, and client onboarding. You will be responsible for building workflows that are efficient, reliable, and easy to debug, as well as optimizing and refactoring existing automations as systems evolve.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong technical capability is required. You should be comfortable working with the GoHighLevel API, webhooks, and third-party automation tools such as Zapier or Make. You will be expected to integrate GoHighLevel with external tools including CRMs, payment processors,\n platforms, membership systems, and tracking tools, while understanding data flow, API limits, and error handling. This is not a surface-level integration role; deep understanding is required.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work closely with one of the original GoHighLevel trainers, as well as with internal marketing strategists and operators. Clear communication, ownership of your work, and the ability to execute without hand-holding are essential. This role requires someone who can take direction, apply strategic thinking, and deliver high-quality builds consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo be considered, you must have advanced, real-world GoHighLevel experience with verifiable examples of complex systems you have built. You must be able to demonstrate a strong track record, provide references, and clearly explain how you have handled workflow complexity, integrations, and scalable system design in past roles. This position is not suitable for beginners, template-only builders, or anyone still learning GoHighLevel fundamentals.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn return, this role offers long-term stability, direct access to top-tier GHL expertise, and the opportunity to build serious systems that directly impact client success and company growth. If you are a true GoHighLevel expert who takes pride in clean builds, smart automation, and scalable architecture, we want to hear from you.                ",

We're a mission-driven health technology company helping thousands of older Americans reduce chronic pain and avoid unnecessary medications. We're growing fast, and we need someone exceptionally detail-oriented to handle customer service and content tasks using AI tools.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur customers are older adults (50+) who are often skeptical, technically challenged, and need compassionate, clear communication. You'll be their main point of contact.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is 60% customer service, 40% content work.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you'll actually be doing:\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomer Service (Primary Focus - 60% of time):\n\r\n- Respond to 20-30 customer inquiries daily \n & chat) in our ticketing system\n\r\n- Use Claude AI to draft responses, then critically review and personalize them\n\r\n- Adapt our\n templates (makros) to each customer's specific situation\n\r\n- Read full conversation history before responding, context is everything\n\r\n- Handle returns, warranty cases, medical questions following our protocols\n\r\n- Know when to escalate vs. handle independently\n\r\n\n\r\nContent & Marketing (40% of time):\n\r\n- Write science-backed blog posts with AI assistance (you prompt, proofread, fact-check, optimize)\n\r\n- Create social media content with Canva (using our templates)\n\r\n- Schedule posts and engage with our audience\n\r\n- Reach out to health & wellness influencers for partnerships (80% automated already)\n\r\n\n\r\nCritical requirements (no exceptions):\n\r\n- 5+ years of customer service experience (preferably in health, wellness, or medical devices)\n\r\n- Near-native English (our customers are American seniors)\n\r\n- Proven experience using AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.). You should already be using AI in your current work\n\r\n- Experience with project management tools (ClickUp, Asana, Trello etc)\n\r\n- Obsessive attention to detail. You catch mistakes others miss\n\r\n- Fast learner who takes notes and doesn't repeat mistakes\n\r\n- Excellent internet connection and professional workspace\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll struggle in this role if you:\n\r\n- Copy-paste AI responses without critical thinking\n\r\n- Don't read full context before responding\n\r\n- Tend to make the same mistake over and over again\n\r\n- Need constant supervision\n\r\n- Work multiple jobs and can't focus\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat makes someone successful here:\n\r\n- Read full context before responding (you're thorough, not rushed)\n\r\n- Customize templates thoughtfully (not copy-paste)\n\r\n- Think critically about whether your responses make sense\n\r\n- Take pride in helping people solve real problems\n\r\n- Want to build something, not just clock hours\n\r\n- See feedback as a gift, not criticism\n\r\n- You work independently but know when to ask for help\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat makes this opportunity different:\n\r\n- Career growth path: We're hiring for a Customer Service Specialist today, but we're building toward a Customer Service Team Lead role. As we scale, the right person will lead our support team, train new hires, and shape our customer experience strategy. \n\r\n- Competitive compensation: $1,000 - $1,200/month USD for full-time (40 hours/week) with true growth potential.\n\r\n- Paid time off: 15 days paid annual leave (includes public holidays, you choose when to take them).\n\r\n- Professional development: Access to courses, AI tools, and direct mentorship from our founder. We invest in people who invest in themselves.\n\r\n- Flexible schedule (must overlap at least 3 hours with Thailand time)\n\r\n- Process-driven company with comprehensive training with documentation, videos, and daily feedback\n\r\n- Cutting-edge tools: You'll work with the latest AI technology. This isn't data entry, you're learning skills that will be valuable for years to come.\n\r\n- Meaningful work: Our customers are grandparents who want to play with their grandkids without pain, veterans managing injuries, people avoiding opioids. Your work directly improves lives.\n\r\n- Stability with a startup: We're profitable, growing steadily, and been in business for 3 years. You get startup opportunity without the risk.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur hiring process:\n\r\n1) Video application (3-5 min) - see questions below\n\r\n2) Video interview (30 min) - we'll get to know you, answer your questions & test your thinking\n\r\n3) Paid trial task (4 hours, $50) - customer service scenarios to filter for skills. Tests attention to detail, AI usage, customer service judgment\n\r\n4) Trial week (20 hours, $160) - Work with real tickets. We will filter for learning ability & work ethic.\n\r\n5) Probation month ($1,000) - for both of us to understand whether we're a good fit\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a high bar. We've had candidates with 10+ years of experience not work out because they lacked attention to detail and didn't learn from mistakes. If you're not someone who naturally catches details and learns quickly, this isn't the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, create a video (Use Loom, Dubb or similar tools) answering these questions:\n\r\n1) Customer service experience: Tell me about your experience (years, industry etc) and mention one of the most challenging tickets you worked on and how you resolved it.\n\r\n2) AI usage: How do you currently use AI in your work? Be specific with tools and tasks\n\r\n3) Why you: Let us know why you think we should choose you over other candidates\n\r\n\n\r\nYour video should be max 5 minutes. Applications without video will be automatically rejected.                ",
