Do you have any prior experience running ads, being inside business centers or ads dashboards?\n\r\n5. Why are you looking for work right now?\n\r\n\n\r\nPS: After initial trial period, performance will be HEAVILY rewarded\n\r\n\n\r\nLooking forward to scaling together!                ",

I’m looking for someone to grow with the brand(s), not just do one-off tasks.\n\r\n\n\r\nTools / Tech Stack (You Should Know Most of These)\n\r\n* Shopify \n\r\n* Meta Ads Manager (at least basic navigation)\n\r\n* Meta Ad Library for creative research\n\r\n* AI store/page builders (e.g., BuildYourStore, Clone.store, Atlas, or similar)\n\r\n* Product research tools (Minea or similar)\n\r\n* Fulfillment / automation tools (AutoDS, TeemDrop, or equivalents)\n\r\n* Google Docs/Sheets, basic reporting.\n\r\nYou don’t need the exact same tools, but you must be comfortable learning equivalents fast.\n\r\n\n\r\nPay, Hours, and Growth\n\r\n* Initial salary: competitive fixed monthly pay (to be discussed), starting as a trial to test skill, reliability, and culture fit.\n\r\n* Workload: initially part-time, with the goal of moving to full-time as we see profitable results.\n\r\n* Big upside: after you hit clear performance benchmarks (e.g., helping launch and scale profitable stores), there is potential for a 5–10% profit share of the store(s).\n\r\n    * Example: If a store makes 100,000 USD/month in profit, you could earn 5,000–10,000 USD/month on top of or including your base, depending on our agreement.\n\r\nI’m serious about rewarding someone who helps build real, long-term brands.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow To Apply\n\r\nSend an\n to: \n\r\n1. Subject line: Branded Dropshipping VA – [Your Name]\n\r\n2. A short intro: who you are, years of ecommerce experience, and what you’re best at.\n\r\n3.

Our founder holds a PhD in Computer Science, brings 25+ years of IT consulting experience, and previously served as the Head of GenAI at a major consultancy. We are looking for exceptional talent to join us on this journey.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nWe are seeking a Senior Frontend Developer & UX/UI Designer (often called a Design Engineer). This is a true hybrid role for someone who thinks in pixels and code. You will own the entire user experience across our ecosystem, from the initial Figma prototype to the final production commit.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are a designer who hates handing off static files, or a developer who cares deeply about typography and micro-interactions, this role is for you. You will create interfaces that make complex AI multi-agent systems feel simple, magical, and intuitive.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Build\n\r\n* Core Product Interfaces: Design and implement the UX for AgentiveCenter (our internal dashboard) and AgentiveHub (the customer-facing portal).\n\r\n* Design System: Architect and maintain a scalable component library using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.\n\r\n* Micro-SaaS Ecosystem: Design and build the frontend for 2-3 standalone SaaS applications we are launching.\n\r\n* Data Visualization: Build complex, real-time dashboards that visualize AI agent activity, project health, and syste\ntrics.\n\r\n* User Flows: Map out and implement intuitive workflows for complex operations (e.g., Human-in-the-Loop approvals, agent monitoring).\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Toolkit\n\r\nWe are looking for mastery in this specific stack:\n\r\n\n\r\nDesign & UX\n\r\n* Figma: You don't just draw rectangles; you build interactive prototypes and organized design systems (Auto Layout, Variables, Components).\n\r\n* User Research: You understand how to validate assumptions before writing code.\n\r\n\n\r\nFrontend Engineering\n\r\n* Core Stack: Next.js, React, and TypeScript.\n\r\n* Styling: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first is your default).\n\r\n* UI Libraries: shadcn/ui (or similar headless component libraries).\n\r\n* Motion & Viz: Framer Motion, Recharts, or similar libraries for data visualization.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI & Operations\n\r\n* AI Coding Workflow: You must be a power user of Cursor or Claude Code. Use of these tools should be second nature to you (6+ months daily experience required).\n\r\n* AI Design Tools: Familiarity with V0, Midjourney, or Figma AI is a strong bonus.\n\r\n* Version Control: 3+ years of confidence with Git/GitHub in team environments.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nMust-Have\n\r\n* 5+ years of professional experience in Frontend Development AND/OR UX/UI Design.\n\r\n* 6+ months of daily, active use of AI coding assistants (Cursor, Copilot, Claude). Note: We expect you to code at \"AI speed.\"\n\r\n* Hybrid Portfolio: A portfolio that demonstrates both polished visual design and high-quality code implementation.\n\r\n* Figma Mastery: You can create production-ready designs that are feasible to build.\n\r\n* Tailwind Proficiency: You can style rapidly without relying on heavy custom CSS.\n\r\n* Visual Taste: Strong grasp of typography, whitespace, color theory, and visual hierarchy.\n\r\n* Communication: Excellent written and verbal English.\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have\n\r\n* Experience scaling Design Systems across multiple products.\n\r\n* Experience designing Developer Tools, SaaS Dashboards, or complex B2B interfaces.\n\r\n* Background in data visualization.\n\r\n* Familiarity with AI/ML interfaces.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Mindset\n\r\n* Design-Engineer Hybrid: You bridge the gap. You don't say \"that's too hard to code\"—you find a way to make it work.\n\r\n* Pixel-Perfect & Pragmatic: You care about the 1px misalignment, but you also know when to ship V1.\n\r\n* User-Obsessed: You advocate for the user in every architectural decision.\n\r\n* AI-Native: You use AI tools not just to code faster, but to design smarter.\n\r\n* Creator: You don't just follow a brief; you invent solutions.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n* Competitive Salary: Based on experience and skill level.\n\r\n* Remote-First: Work from anywhere (PH time zones preferred for collaboration).\n\r\n* Equity: Stock options available for key hires.\n\r\n* Creative Ownership: You will define the visual identity of the entire platform.\n\r\n* Mentorship: Work directly with technical founders on cutting-edge AI.\n\r\n* No Bureaucracy: Small team, fast decisions, results-oriented culture.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nPlease submit the following:\n\r\n1. Resume/CV.\n\r\n2. Portfolio: (Link to Behance, Dribbble, personal site, or PDF).\n\r\n* Must show: UI/UX design work.\n\r\n* Must show: Frontend code implementation (GitHub links or live sites).\n\r\n* Ideal: Projects where you handled both design and code.\n\r\n3. GitHub Profile.\n\r\n4. AI Workflow Brief: Briefly describe your experience with AI tools (Which do you use? How do they fit into your design-to-code workflow?).\n\r\n5. Video Introduction (Mandatory): A 3-5 minute video.\n\r\n* Tell us about yourself.\n\r\n* Walk us through your best design/code work. Explain your decisions.\n\r\n* Explain why you want to join Agentive.\n\r\n* Upload to YouTube (unlisted), Vimeo, or Google Drive and share the link.\n\r\n\n\r\nInterview Process\n\r\n1. Portfolio & Video Review: We evaluate your design sense and code quality.\n\r\n2. Design Challenge: A small, specific task requiring both design and implementation (Window: 3-4 days).\n\r\n3. Live Interview: Portfolio walkthrough and technical design discussion (1 hour).\n\r\n4. Culture Fit: Conversation with the founder (30 min).\n\r\n5. Offer: Extended within 1 week of the final interview.\n\r\n\n\r\nAgentive is an equal opportunity employer.                ",

Our shorts should feel cinematic, elegant, hypnotic, visceral, and expensive. (Be prepared to innovate as demands and trends change.)\n\r\nYou will receive scripts, AI tool access, and style references. Your job is to build the scene: generate AI visuals, source archival footage, layer sound design, add voiceover from elevenlabs, and deliver shorts where every second earns the next.\n\r\nWe are hiring for taste, cinematic instinct, and the ability to treat AI generation as a serious production tool.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE STYLE\n\r\nMultiple styles as demand and trends change; Dark luxury. Museum. Stylish and lethal. Rich textures. Controlled palette. Both silence and impact used with intention. Every cut has a reason.\n\r\nNot: default presets, stock photo slideshows.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\nProduce vertical shorts (YouTube Shorts / TikTok / Reels) end-to-end using our scripts, style kits, and current channel benchmarks:\n\r\n\n\r\nEdit: Assemble 30-120s vertical shorts with elegant pacing and restraint. The voiceover leads — visuals serve. You know when to let a line breathe and when to accelerate.\n\r\nGenerate: Create supporting visuals using AI image and video tools (Seedream, Veo, Kling, and whatever launches next). We provide all paid accounts and internal prompting workflows — you bring creative judgment and iteration speed.\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Beat-matching, swells, drops, and silence to drive visual storytelling. You understand rhythm as an editing tool — not decoration.\n\r\nProduct Integration: Place static jewelry photos into moving scenes so they look physically present — masking, light/shadow matching, subtle color grading. Convincing realism, not floating stickers. (AI can handle lot of this, but requires a good eye for it.)\n\r\nFinish: Minimal kinetic typography + copyright-safe or licensed classical/atmospheric audio (Generated via Suno).\n\r\nFile Hygiene: Clean bin structure, naming conventions. Project files and assets uploaded to Notion/\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCORE REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Eye (Taste and Edit execution is priority. AI tools are quick to learn). You instinctively know the difference between luxury and cheap. Starting out, you'll receive reference videos of our current benchmarks and experimental formats. Your job is to match that standard consistently and innovate on top of them.\n\r\nVoiceover-First Storytelling. You edit to narration first, music second. You never bury a punchline under a flashy transition.\n\r\nRetention Instinct. The first frame is an ad for the second frame. You know what stops a scroll. You build hooks visually. Every 2–3 seconds, something changes.\n\r\nAI Fluency. You're comfortable generating, iterating, and curating AI output across image and video tools. You treat generation as production — prompting, reviewing, selecting, and refining until the output meets the standard.\n\r\nAdobe Premiere Pro. Required for project handoffs and consistency.\n\r\nStrong English. Daily async communication — clear, direct, and professional.\n\r\nReliable & Coachable. You hit deadlines or warn early. You take direct feedback and iterate fast. You flag problems with options, not excuses.\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus (not required, but noticed):\n\r\nAfter Effects compositing, Mocha tracking, advanced color grading, sound design beyond music (SFX layering, risers, hits).\n\r\n\n\r\nVOLUME & DELIVERABLES\n\r\n\n\r\nRamp-up (first 2–3 weeks): 2–3 shorts/week as you learn the brand voice and pipeline\n\r\nSteady state: Push to 4 high quality vertical shorts per week.\n\r\nDeliverables: 1080×1920 minimum, 30fps, MP4 (H.264)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nRAM: 16GB minimum (32GB preferred) + SSD\n\r\nReliable high-speed internet (upload speed matters)\n\r\nMust run Premiere Pro and browser-based AI tools simultaneously without issue\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPAID TRIAL (Shortlisted Candidates)\n\r\nBefore any full-time commitment, we run a paid weekly trial. We provide scripts, elevenlabs access for voiceover, and style references/benchmarks. You deliver 30–50 second shorts. Trial is compensated at $250 USD at the end of each week. If it's a mutual fit after 30 days, we transition to bi-weekly payments of $550 (before work).\n\r\nThis protects both sides — you see whether the work fits your strengths, we see whether the output fits our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\r\n\n\r\nPaid accounts for all frontier AI tools\n\r\nCreative identity — you're building the visual language of a brand from launch, not filling someone else's template\n\r\nClear briefs — scripts, audio files, mood boards, and reference videos for every batch\n\r\nDirect feedback — specific, constructive notes on every edit\n\r\nA brand worth building — Prismiera launches soon, with a second and third AI-native brands after that, which cover a wide variety of content scopes. You're helping build the machine.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nOWNERSHIP & CONFIDENTIALITY\n\r\nAll outputs (edits, project files, prompts, generated assets) are Prismiera property and must remain confidential.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nImportant: Use at least 7 Apply Points when applying on OnlineJobs.ph.\n\r\nSubject line: PRISMIERA EDITOR — [Your Favorite Historical Art Era]\n\r\nSend only the following (numbered exactly):\n\r\n\n\r\nPortfolio. Links to your 3 best vertical shorts (mood/atmosphere preferred — not vlogs). Label one that demonstrates music-driven pacing.\n\r\nThe Story Test. Link to ONE short that includes voiceover or spoken dialogue. We need to see that you can pace visuals to a script. (Can overlap with #1.)\n\r\nLuxury Test (3–5 bullets). How do you make an edit feel \"expensive\" instead of \"cheap\"?\n\r\nAI Experience (1–2 sentences). What is your experience level with generative AI tools? If none, say so — we'll evaluate the rest on its own merits.\n\r\nTechnical (exactly 3 sentences). Describe your approach to compositing a static product photo into a moving scene so it looks physically present.\n\r\nSpecs. PC specs (CPU / GPU / RAM / SSD) + internet upload speed (screenshot preferred).\n\r\nIntegrity (1–2 sentences). Describe a time you missed a deadline or made a mistake — what did you do next?\n\r\nThe Rewrite. Rewrite this sentence in a cinematic tone: \"She is really cool and strong and she wins.\"                ",

This role is designed to grow into a full-time position for the right person.\n\r\nYou will be the operational backbone — keeping projects moving, keeping communication clean, and making sure nothing falls through the cracks. This is not a basic data-entry VA role. We need someone who is organized, proactive, communicates clearly, and can work independently once trained.\n\r\nWorking Hours\n\r\nThis role requires availability during Pacific Standard Time (PST) business hours. You must have prior experience working PST or US West Coast hours. Please do not apply if you cannot commit to these hours.\n\r\nWhat You Will Do\n\r\nYour time will be split roughly across three areas:\n\r\n \n\r\nProject Management (~40%)\n\r\n• Receive task briefs via\n and assign them to the appropriate freelancer\n\r\n• Track deadlines and follow up with freelancers to ensure on-time delivery\n\r\n• Check Google Drive and Dropbox for client content, move files to editors, collect finished work, and route to posting\n\r\n• Flag delays and keep projects moving without needing to be chased\n\r\n \n\r\nContent & Social Media (~40%)\n\r\n• Schedule and post content across social media platforms using a scheduling tool (Buffer, Later, or similar)\n\r\n• Generate captions and copy using AI tools and pre-built prompts\n\r\n• Create short video clips from long-form podcast or video content using CapCut or Premiere Pro templates\n\r\n• Upload content to YouTube and podcast channels with AI-generated titles and descriptions\n\r\n \n\r\nAdministrative Support (~20%)\n\r\n• Manage calendar invites — sending, receiving, and keeping the calendar accurate\n\r\n• Receive post-call summary notes via\n and enter them into Notion as organized tasks\n\r\n• Draft clear task instructions for freelancers and either get sign-off or send directly to the appropriate channel\n\r\n• Keep communication organized — important tasks go through\n, not chat\n\r\nTools You Must Already Know\n\r\nDo not apply if you do not have working knowledge of the following. We will ask you to demonstrate competency during the hiring process. We are looking for a jack-of-all-trades digital marketer — someone who has touched most of these tools and can ramp up quickly on the rest.\n\r\n \n\r\nProject Management & Admin\n\r\n• Notion — task management, project tracking, and database management (minimum 6/10)\n\r\n• GoHighLevel (GHL) — CRM navigation, pipeline management, and basic automation (minimum 5/10)\n\r\n• Google Drive and Dropbox — file management, folder organization, and sharing\n\r\n•\n — primary channel for all task assignments and project handoffs\n\r\n• Zoom and Loom — for team check-ins and async training videos\n\r\n \n\r\nContent Creation & Design\n\r\n• Canva — creating social media graphics, carousels, and branded templates (minimum 6/10)\n\r\n• AI writing tools — ChatGPT, Claude, or similar for copy generation and prompt building (minimum 7/10)\n\r\n• Social media scheduling tools — Buffer, Later, or equivalent\n\r\n \n\r\nVideo & Audio\n\r\n• CapCut and/or Premiere Pro — video editing using templates, creating short clips from long-form content (minimum 6/10)\n\r\n• Podcast audio editing — basic cleanup, trimming, and export for distribution platforms\n\r\n• YouTube — uploading, titling, tagging, and basic channel management\n\r\nHow We Communicate\n\r\n•\n: All task assignments, project updates, and important deliverables go through\n\r\n• WhatsApp: Quick questions and fast back-and-forth only — not for tasks\n\r\n• Zoom: Weekly or bi-weekly syncs\n\r\n• Loom: Async training videos and how-to walkthroughs\n\r\nWhat We Are Looking For\n\r\n• PST availability — this is non-negotiable\n\r\n• Digital marketing generalist — you have touched content creation, social media, video editing, CRM tools, and project management. You do not need to be an expert in everything, but you need to be competent across the board.\n\r\n• Strong written English — you will be communicating with clients and freelancers\n\r\n• High attention to detail — tasks need to be completed correctly, not just completed\n\r\n• Self-starter — you can take a rough voice note or\n and turn it into action without step-by-step hand-holding\n\r\n• Reliability — you show up, you follow through, and you communicate if something goes wrong\n\r\n• Experience working with US-based founders, marketing agencies, or professional service businesses is a strong plus\n\r\nWhat This Is Not\n\r\n• This is not a role for someone looking for simple copy-paste work\n\r\n• This is not a role for someone who needs constant supervision\n\r\n• This is not a good fit if you cannot work PST hours consistently\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nSend your applicat                ",

    "description": "\n                    Innovative global coffee brand inventing one-of-a-kind tools redefining how coffee is experienced. Seeking a Marketing Manager to own campaigns, launches, and cross-channel execution alongside founders.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT ICOSA BREWHOUSE:\n\r\nICOSA Brewhouse is a globally recognized specialty coffee brand redefining how coffee is experienced. We are shaping coffee culture around the world. (\n  / \n )\n\r\n\n\r\nWe design and invent one-of-a-kind tools that didn’t exist before — tools that elevate everyday rituals and introduce new ways of enjoying coffee.\n\r\n\n\r\nFrom record-breaking Kickstarter launches to collaborations with world-class coffee professionals, our products are used by champions, in top cafés, and in homes in 100+ countries around the world. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a design-led, innovation-driven brand operating in a niche we are actively shaping. We build thoughtfully, test deliberately, and care deeply about quality — in both product and execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs we continue to innovate, launch new products, and grow, we are looking for a Senior Social Media & Marketing Manager to take ownership of how our work is brought to life across channels.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou won’t just publish content.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll help shape how new products are introduced, how campaigns are structured, and how our global community experiences our brand — while ensuring execution remains disciplined, consistent, and scalable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR ROLE AND OPPORTUNITY ON THE TEAM:\n\r\nThis is a senior marketing operator role. Execution is central — but it is not a junior content posting role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work directly with our Marketing Lead to:\n\r\n• Own day-to-day marketing delivery across core channels\n\r\n• Structure and execute campaigns from planning through rollout\n\r\n• Translate ideas into clear, executable briefs\n\r\n• Coordinate creative production across internal, outsourced, and AI-assisted workflows\n\r\n• Strengthen how our marketing engine operates over time\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will see early product prototypes.\n\r\nYou will contribute to campaign discussions before launch.\n\r\nYou will help shape how innovation is presented to a global audience.\n\r\n\n\r\nExecution is central to this role — but so is judgment, ownership, and the ability to think in campaigns rather than isolated posts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll own:\n\r\n\n\r\n(1) Marketing Execution Across Channels\n\r\n• Own social media execution (Instagram and\n).\n\r\n• Plan and manage content calendars aligned with brand positioning.\n\r\n• Ensure consistent publishing and follow-through across platforms.\n\r\n• Manage inbox and community engagement, including partnership or influencer communication if required.\n\r\n• Execute\n campaigns aligned with launches, promotions, and collaborations.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou ensure marketing execution remains structured, timely, and dependable.\n\r\n\n\r\n(2) Campaign Rollout & Launch Execution\n\r\n• Support and execute seasonal campaigns, product launches, collaborations, and promotional initiatives.\n\r\n• Translate marketing objectives into structured creative briefs.\n\r\n• Coordinate creative asset development across designers, freelancers, and AI-supported workflows.\n\r\n• Oversee cohesive cross-channel rollout so messaging, visuals, and timing align across social,\n, and paid efforts.\n\r\n• Strengthen campaign structure and rollout processes over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou think in campaigns — not just content pieces.\n\r\n\n\r\n(3) Creative Briefing & Quality Control\n\r\n• Create clear, structured briefs for design and content production.\n\r\n• Maintain high standards of aesthetic consistency, messaging clarity, and brand voice integrity across both human and AI-assisted workflows.\n\r\n• Draft copy or guide AI-assisted content creation when needed, ensuring outputs remain on-brand and high quality.\n\r\n• Review creative outputs for brand alignment before escalation to the Marketing Lead.\n\r\n• Collaborate comfortably in tools such as Figma or similar platforms to support execution and alignment.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou don’t need to be a designer — but you should have strong creative judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\n(4) Growth & Operational Development\n\r\n• Identify opportunities to refine workflows and strengthen how our marketing engine operates.\n\r\n• Lead or contribute to structured testing and rollout of new channels or initiatives as capacity allows.\n\r\n• Over time, take increasing ownership of campaign structuring, cross-channel coordination, partnership campaign oversight, and creative alignment across performance-driven efforts.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs you demonstrate reliability and judgment, your scope expands meaningfully.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat success looks like:\n\r\n• Social and\n channels operate smoothly with consistent execution and strong brand alignment.\n\r\n• Campaigns are rolled out in a coordinated, cross-channel manner without last-minute chaos.\n\r\n• Creative briefs are structured, clear, and reduce friction across collaborators.\n\r\n• Marketing execution no longer bottlenecks leadership attention.\n\r\n• Early experiments in new channels or initiatives are tested in a structured way.\n\r\n\n\r\nOver time, you become a trusted execution leader within the marketing team.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Is Not:\n\r\n• Not a pure content creator role.\n\r\n• Not a brand strategist role.\n\r\n• Not a paid media buyer role.\n\r\n• Not an administrative coordinator role.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a senior marketing operator position inside a growing global brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT YOU / WHO WE’RE LOOKING FOR:\n\r\nYou are someone who:\n\r\n• Understands how structured marketing campaigns come together.\n\r\n• Can translate ideas into clear execution plans.\n\r\n• Is comfortable owning delivery without hand-holding.\n\r\n• Is comfortable reviewing performance data and using insights to inform execution decisions.\n\r\n• Is strategic enough to think ahead — but practical enough to execute consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are strategic enough to think ahead — but practical enough to execute consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have skills or experience:\n\r\n• 4–6+ years of experience managing marketing and/or social for a brand.\n\r\n• Experience executing structured marketing campaigns.\n\r\n• Experience within D2C or product-based brands strongly preferred.\n\r\n• Comfortable operating inside e-commerce environments.\n\r\n• Highly detail-oriented and disciplined in follow-through.\n\r\n• Strong creative judgment and ability to assess content quality and brand alignment.\n\r\n• Comfort collaborating in design tools such as Figma.\n\r\n• Comfortable working directly with founders in a small, fast-moving team.\n\r\n\n\r\nBig pluses:\n\r\n• Experience supporting product launches or crowdfunding campaigns.\n\r\n• Experience creating, implementing, and refining marketing processes or building SOPs.\n\r\n• Experience coordinating freelancers or creative collaborators.\n\r\n• Familiarity with Klaviyo or similar\n platforms.\n\r\n• Exposure to AI-assisted marketing workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY JOIN US:\n\r\nAt ICOSA Brewhouse, you will:\n\r\n• Work directly with founders who are deeply involved in product design, positioning, and global campaigns.\n\r\n• Operate close to innovation — seeing products and launches before they are introduced to the world.\n\r\n• Contribute to campaigns that reach a global coffee audience.\n\r\n• Have real ownership inside a small, high-performing team where your work is visible and impactful.\n\r\n• Help shape coffee culture around the world.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a fully remote team — but we operate with structure and discipline.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be joining a close-knit group focused on building something meaningful with collaboration and accountability. There is no office politics. No unnecessary hierarchy. Just people committed to high standards.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe care deeply about growth — not just as a company, but as individuals. As we expand, there are real opportunities to take on broader ownership, lead initiatives, and shape how our marketing evolves.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want a role where:\n\r\n• Your ideas are heard.\n\r\n• Your execution matters.\n\r\n• Your scope can grow with your capability.\n\r\nYou will feel at home here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION AND WORKING STRUCTURE\n\r\nFull time: 40 hours/week \n\r\nCompensation range: $1,100-$1,800 (based on relevant experience and demonstrated capability)\n\r\nUp to 16 days of paid time off annually\n\r\nAsia time zone working hours required\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nAre you ready? \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’d like to join us on our journey and grow together with us, we’re looking forward to meeting you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe understand you may have a busy schedule, so we’ve made our application process extremely efficient. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please follow the steps below:\n\r\n1.

We are looking for proven capability, not theory.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Actually Do\n\r\n\n\r\n• Own visual consistency across products, marketing, and digital assets.\n\r\n• Build reusable visual styles and frameworks that teams can follow.\n\r\n• Improve AI-generated outputs through design judgment, prompting refinement, and layout decisions.\n\r\n• Work with AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney/SDXL/ComfyUI-style workflows, etc.).\n\r\n• Guide teams on composition, brand alignment, and visual hierarchy.\n\r\n• Convert raw AI outputs into polished, conversion-ready assets.\n\r\n• Help scale production without sacrificing quality.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Is NOT\n\r\n\n\r\n• Not a junior designer role.\n\r\n• Not someone making random Canva graphics.\n\r\n• Not someone who only knows traditional design software without AI workflow experience.\n\r\n• Not someone who needs heavy direction.\n\r\n\n\r\nIdeal Candidate Profile\n\r\n\n\r\n• Strong visual taste and commercial design judgment.\n\r\n• Experience working with AI-generated assets.\n\r\n• Understands how to reduce visual drift and maintain consistency at scale.\n\r\n• Can think in systems, not just single images.\n\r\n• Comfortable working in fast, high-output environments.\n\r\n• Bonus: motion/animation experience for short-form content.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow Success Will Be Measured\n\r\n\n\r\n• Visual consistency improves across products and platforms.\n\r\n• AI outputs require less rework.\n\r\n• Product designs feel cohesive and brand-aligned.\n\r\n• Teams move faster because design direction is clear.\n\r\n\n\r\nScreening Questions (Required — No Exceptions)\n\r\n\n\r\n1. What visual or production problem did you encounter in a real project?\n\r\nExplain the problem clearly.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. What did you personally do to fix it?\n\r\nDescribe your process, decisions, and tools used (especially AI tools if applicable).\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Show the result.\n\r\nProvide before/after examples or links and explain how your work improved outcomes (quality, consistency, speed, or performance).\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for builders and problem-solvers, not portfolio-only designers.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you cannot clearly explain your thinking process and show measurable improvement from your work, this role is not a fit.

This is the work I have guaranteed right now, but as I book more sessions and weddings, they will be added onto a task board right away so that you can see well in advance what I'll need help with and when it would be due, which will give you plenty of time to plan your life and other editing jobs accordingly around that.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs a heads up, I use an Ai editing tool to help me with the base edit so that the editing process is as efficient as possible. This means you would receive a Lightroom catalog with the images partially or mostly edited, but I still need help getting them fully completed through cropping, straightening, brush work, spot removal / eliminating distractions exposure + temperature correction, etc. and ensuring the images match my signature style.\n\r\n\n\r\nSince the Ai editing tool will be taking care of the base edit, this means that it will take you less time per image to finish the edit to the standard I'm looking for since there will already be a base edit applied. For this reason, I'm looking for someone who can fine tune these images for $0.12 CAD per image. There will also be Photoshop retouching needed on a case by case basis, which includes advanced object removal and head swaps (only on selected images) and comes at an additional pay at $0.12 CAD per image.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere is what I need help with:\n\r\n\n\r\n-Fine tuning/editing about\n+ photos per wedding in Lightroom using a preset I work with\n\r\n-Fine tuning/editing about 15-50+photos per session Lightroom using a preset I work with\n\r\n-Using brush tool, graduated filters, cropping, straightening, and making sure the Al tool got the correct exposure and colour temperature (you will be trained on how I edit my photos)\n\r\n- Object removal and head swaps using Photoshop on a case by case basis \n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I am NOT looking for:\n\r\n\n\r\n*If you are disorganized or have difficulty with deadlines and structure, please do not apply. \n\r\n*If you can't take honest feedback well and can learn quickly from the feedback, please do not apply.\n\r\n* If you have an unreliable internet connection, please do not apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\r\n* Seeking a long-term, part-time seasonal role, with primary work between May - November. \n\r\n*Dedicated, Loyal, On-Time, Organized, Hits Deadlines, Detail Oriented, Creative, Quick Learner, strong in English\n\r\n*Strong attention to detail and the ability to follow creative direction.\n\r\n*Experienced in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop.\n\r\n*Someone who takes responsibility for the work they do and doesn't make excuses \n\r\n*Someone who prides themselves on being detail-oriented and creating consistent high quality results\n\r\n*Someone who is EXCITED to edit wedding and couples photos full of emotion and beauty \n\r\n*Ideally someone who could support me with having a 5-7 day turnaround time for weddings and a 2-3 business day turnaround time for sessions.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this sounds like you and you'd love to connect more about this opportunity, reply to this job post with the following: your WhatsApp number, your\n, let me know if you have Photoshop / Lightroom, let me know if you have a strong internet connection, why you love editing photos for other photographers, if $0.12 CAD per image works for you, examples of edited work you enjoyed editing, and an inspirational quote that makes you happy,\n\r\n\n\r\nAs a heads up, I will only be responding to applicants that I will select for the interview process, so if you don't hear back fro\n by March 3rd, I've d\n to go in a different direction.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Kayla                ",

The Supreme Court just ruled that over $175 billion in tariffs were unconstitutional. We contact importers, show them how much they are owed, and handle everything to get their money back.\n\r\nBusiness is growing fast. We need a closer who can get on the phone with US business owners and close deals.\n\r\nWhat You Will Do:\n\r\nTake 4-6 scheduled sales calls per day with US importers. These are warm leads who already replied to our\ns saying they are interested. You follow our proven sales script, walk them through their refund amount and our services, and close the deal. After every YES you send the engagement letter and payment link. After every MAYBE you follow up within 3 business days. You update our tracking sheet and send a daily report.\n\r\nWhat You Will NOT Do:\n\r\nCold call. We never cold call. All leads come to you pre-qualified and scheduled on a calendar. You do not generate leads or handle any compliance paperwork.\n\r\nCompensation:\n\r\n$500/month base salary paid twice monthly on the 1st and 15th via Wise.\n\r\n25% commission on every upfront audit fee you close. You close a $4,000 audit, you earn $1,000. You close a $7,500 audit, you earn $1,875.\n\r\n10% commission on monthly retainer fees for the first 6 months per client. You close a client paying $3,000 per month retainer, you earn $300 per month from that client for 6 months.\n\r\n5% bonus on recovery fees when refunds arrive for your clients.\n\r\n$500 bonus for signing your first 5 clients within 30 days. $1,000 bonus for signing 10 or more clients in any single month.\n\r\nExample earnings:\n\r\nMonth 1: Close 8 clients at an average $4,000 audit fee. $500 base + $8,000 audit commission + $2,000 retainer commission = $10,500 in your first month. Top performers will earn $15,000 to $20,000 per month within 6 months. This is not a typo. We pay well because this role directly generates revenue.\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\nSTRONG American English accent. This is the most important requirement. You will be speaking with US business owners, CEOs, and executives who need to trust you immediately on the phone. If you have a noticeable Filipino accent, this role is not the right fit. We need someone who sounds indistinguishable from a native American English speaker. If you are not confident in your American accent, please do not apply.\n\r\nMinimum 2 years of phone sales experience closing deals. Not appointment setting. Not customer service. Closing.\n\r\nExperience selling B2B services such as consulting, insurance, real estate, SaaS, or professional services.\n\r\nComfortable speaking with CEOs, business owners, and executives who run companies doing $1 million to $50 million in annual revenue.\n\r\nReliable high speed internet connection and a quiet workspace with no background noise.\n\r\nAvailable to work US Eastern Time hours Monday through Friday.\n\r\nNice to Have but Not Required:\n\r\nExperience in finance, consulting, or professional services sales. Experience with Google Sheets, Calendly, Stripe, or CRM tools. Knowledge of international trade, importing, or customs. We will train you on our industry.\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\nStep 1. Put the word CLOSER in your\n subject line. Applications without this word will be deleted immediately.\n\r\nStep 2. Record a 60 second voice recording of yourself. Do not read from a script. Just talk naturally and say the following in your own words:\n\r\nYour name. How many years of sales experience you have. The biggest deal you have ever closed and what happened. Why you are the right person for this job. When you are available to start.\n\r\nStep 3. Upload or link your voice recording with your application.\n\r\nStep 4. Include your resume.\n\r\nApplications without a voice recording will not be reviewed. No exceptions. Your voice is your most important tool in this role. We must hear it before considering you.\n\r\nWe are hiring ONE person immediately with a second position opening within 3 to 4 weeks. If you are a real closer who can sell, this opportunity will change your financial life. If you are looking for easy low pressure work, this is not it.                ",
