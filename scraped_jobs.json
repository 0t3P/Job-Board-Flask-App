    "description": "\n                    [Caution]\n\r\nIf you are a meticulous developer who is passionate about creating smooth, high-performance mobile experiences and takes pride in writing clean, scalable code, this role will be a great fit.\n\r\nThis position requires a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end mobile development, a keen eye for UI/UX implementation, and the ability to think strategically about the product's architecture and future growth.\n\r\nIf you view app development as simply translating designs into code mostly relying on AI without considering response to errors or bugs, security, and the end-user experience, this role may be a challenge for you.\n\r\nSo, only read further if you’re passionate about building a robust, engaging, and seamless mobile extension for a thriving online community (ideally with a self-assessed ability level of 4.5 out of 5 stars or higher).\n\r\n\n\r\n[Job Title]\n\r\nAndroid/iOS App Developer (synced with our Community Website)\n\r\n\n\r\n[Work Type]\n\r\nRemote | Flexible Hours | Long-term Project\n\r\n\n\r\n[Base Payment]\n\r\nWe offer a project-based compensation structure for those who apply as part-time. That said, the expected monthly range is USD $700–$1,400(for full-time workers), depending on factors such as proficiency, workload, task complexity, performance (including bonuses), experience, skill set, and the final scope of responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Bonus]\n\r\nThere's potential for a performance-based bonus tied to key project milestones, such as a successful app launch and achieving performance metrics. We'll go over those details once you've demonstrated your skills.\n\r\n\n\r\n[What You’ll Be Doing]\n\r\nYour role is to be the technical architect and builder of our community website. You will be responsible for creating a high-quality, full-featured platform that provides a seamless and engaging experience for our users. \n\r\nYour main tasks will include ONE or MULTIPLE of:\n\r\n\n\r\na) API Integration & Data Synchronization: You will be responsible for integrating with our website's backend via APIs to ensure all data (user profiles, content, messages) is perfectly synchronized in real-time between the app and the website, providing a single, unified experience for our users.\n\r\n\n\r\nb) Native Community Feature Development: You will build the core interactive features of our community—such as content feeds, user profiles, and forums—within the app. This involves creating an intuitive, mobile-first interface for user-generated content submission and ensuring all features have a native look and feel on both iOS and Android.\n\r\n\n\r\nc) In-App Messaging & Support Systems: You will develop a secure and reliable private messaging system for our users. This includes implementing push notifications to ensure timely communication and integrating a streamlined way for users to access our support channels directly from the app.\n\r\n\n\r\nd) UI/UX Implementation & Performance Optimization: You will translate UI/UX designs into a pixel-perfect, functional application. Your focus will be on creating a fast, fluid, and responsive user experience, optimizing code and interactions to eliminate lag and ensure consistency across all devices and screen sizes.\n\r\n\n\r\ne) Comprehensive Testing & Quality Assurance: You will be responsible for rigorously testing the app to identify and fix bugs before launch. This includes creating detailed test cases for all features, covering edge cases, and testing for compatibility across multiple physical devices and OS versions.\n\r\n\n\r\nf) App Store Deployment & Management: You will manage the entire process of submitting and launching the application on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. This requires a deep understanding of each store's guidelines to ensure a smooth approval process and optimizing the listings for discoverability.\n\r\n\n\r\ng) Long-Term Maintenance & Scalability: After launch, you will provide ongoing maintenance, fix bugs, and release updates to ensure compatibility with new iOS and Android versions. You will build the app on a scalable architecture to make it easy to add new features and handle a growing user base in the future\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[A Typical Week May Look Like This]\n\r\n\n\r\nDuring Development: Writing clean, scalable code for new features. Collaborating with the team on API specifications. Implementing UI designs and animations. Debugging and testing builds on various devices. Committing code to our Git repository.\n\r\n\n\r\nPost-Launch: Monitoring app performance and crash reports. Planning and developing new features based on community feedback. Releasing updates to ensure compatibility with new iOS and Android versions.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Goal]\n\r\nThe ultimate goal is to create a fast, reliable, and intuitive mobile app that serves as a seamless extension of our online community. By building a high-quality application, you will empower our members to connect and share on the go, significantly boosting user engagement and making our community an essential part of their daily lives.\n\r\n\n\r\n[What We’re Looking For]\n\r\nThe ideal candidate:\n\r\n\n\r\na) Has a Strong Portfolio: You have verifiable experience building and launching native mobile applications. Not necessary, but it's best if you have live examples in the Apple App Store and/or Google Play Store. Experience with community or social media apps is a huge plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nb) Is Technically Proficient: You are an expert in your chosen mobile development stack (e.g., Swift/Kotlin, React Native, Flutter) and have deep experience working with REST APIs. You follow best practices and write clean, maintainable code.\n\r\n\n\r\nc) Is a Natural Problem-Solver: When faced with a technical challenge like a performance bottleneck, you have a logical process for diagnosing the root cause and implementing an effective solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nd) Is a Clear & Proactive Communicator: You can explain complex technical concepts simply.\n\r\n\n\r\ne) Is Product-Minded: You care about the end-user experience. You think critically about features and can offer valuable insights to help make the product better.\n\r\n\n\r\nf) Communicates Effectively and Values Respect: You are reliable, accountable, and understand the importance of clear communication within a remote team.\n\r\n\n\r\n*Important Note:\n\r\nWe value respectful communication. What does it mean? Most importantly, if you need to step away, just let me or your manager know when. We understand it, even if you need to leave tomorrow, BUT ghosting is the last thing you'd like to do, since it causes confusion and delays. In everyday conversations, our team thrives on mutual respect, no matter your role.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Why Work With Us?]\n\r\n\n\r\n-Flexible hours to suit your lifestyle.\n\r\n-The opportunity to own a project and build an exciting product from the ground up.\n\r\n-Long-term growth opportunities as our community and app scale.\n\r\n-A supportive environment where your technical expertise is valued and your impact is visible.\n\r\n\n\r\n[About Us]\n\r\nWe are building a vibrant online community for content creators. Our mission is to provide a space where members can connect, learn, and grow. Your role in building our mobile app is essential in taking that mission to the next level.\n\r\n\n\r\n[How to Apply]\n\r\nSubject Line: Start your title with “iOS App Developer” or \"Android App Developer\" whichever best identifies you, or your application can't be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application, include:\n\r\n\n\r\n1) Please indicate which items (a–f) from the [What You’ll Be Doing] section above you can handle professionally and confidently.\n\r\n\n\r\n2) Work History: Based on your response to Question 1, please describe your experience for each item (a–f).\n\r\n\n\r\n3) Portfolio: Include direct links to your two best live web applications you’ve built. Do not include all your projects. Time is very limited. Briefly describe your specific role and the tech stack used in those two projects.\n\r\n\n\r\n4) Technical Challenge: Imagine our users are reporting that the app feels slow and \"janky\" when they scroll through the main content feed. What are the first five steps you would take to diagnose and fix this performance issue?\n\r\n\n\r\n5) Architectural Scenario: You are tasked with building the in-app private messaging feature.

Conversely, what is one part that you find consistently frustrating or poorly designed, and how do you typically work around its limitations in your projects?\n\r\n\n\r\n6) Preferred Tool Stack: What is your go-to development environment? Please list any specific debugging tools, IDEs, and version control systems you prefer to use.\n\r\n\n\r\n7) Explain where and how you use AI to improve your productivity, and where you deliberately choose not to rely on AI. (Wish you aren't using AI for answering these questions, because they will be further discussed in the interview later.)\n\r\n\n\r\n8) Available Hours: Let us know your general availability (e.g., \"Approximately 20 hours per week, mostly flexible between 1PM - 8PM on Monday, 3 PM - 10PM on Tuesday, 12PM - 8PM on Wednesday, ...,  in Philippines time\").\n\r\n\n\r\n9) Available Period of Work: Let us know for how long you expect to work with us. We'd prefer at least 6 months with opportunities for extension.\n\r\n\n\r\n10) Willingness for Zoo\netings: Confirm that you're willing to participate in occasional Zoo\netings for team alignment and check-ins.\n\r\n\n\r\nI will respond to your application in 7-15 days all at once.\n\r\nWe look forward to hearing from you                ",

    "description": "\n                    Hi!\n\r\nWe run a faceless YouTube channel about pets (mostly dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens), and we’re looking for thumbnail designers who can consistently create scroll-stopping, curiosity-provoking thumbnails that are readable instantly on a phone screen.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a traditional full-time position.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe work with a small roster of designers and assign thumbnails on a per-thumbnail basis. Some designers specialize in compilation thumbnails, and some in info-style thumbnails. If we’re a good fit, this can become steady, long-term work.\n\r\n________________________________________\n\r\nThe Most Important Skill (Please Read)\n\r\nOur #1 rule:\n\r\nIf the thumbnail doesn’t read in one second at small mobile size, while people are scrolling on their phones, it doesn’t work.\n\r\nWe design for the phone screen first, not the desktop screen.\n\r\n\n\r\nThat means:\n\r\n• Clear visual story\n\r\n• Strong focal point\n\r\n• Minimal clutter\n\r\n• Expressions and emotion that are easy to read\n\r\n• Clean backgrounds or simplified compositions when needed\n\r\n\n\r\nMany frames from videos are busy or cluttered, so part of the job is knowing how to simplify, isolate, and clarify the story visually.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this is something you’re already good at, you’ll do very well with us.\n\r\n________________________________________\n\r\nHow This Role Works\n\r\n\n\r\nWe provide a shared folder with the materials you need to create your video thumbnail. Depending on the type of video/thumbnail it can include things like:\n\r\n• The video title/video\n\r\n• Thumbnail direction/brief/concept/idea\n\r\n• Sample thumbnails that match our channel style and tone\n\r\n\n\r\nYour role is to design a thumbnail that matches the overall look, feel, and strategy of the channel—while still using your design judgment to make it visually strong and clickable.\n\r\n\n\r\nRevisions are a normal part of the process as we refine thumbnails for performance.\n\r\n________________________________________\n\r\nWhat We Need From You\n\r\n• Strong graphic design skills\n\r\n• Experience designing thumbnails specifically for YouTube\n\r\n• Ability to simplify and declutter images\n\r\n• Ability to create a clear visual “story” at small size\n\r\n• Ability to understand and visually convey emotion (especially animal expressions)\n\r\n• Ability to follow a design brief and implement feedback\n\r\n• Reliable communication and turnaround\n\r\n________________________________________\n\r\nHow Payment Works\n\r\n• Paid per thumbnail\n\r\n• Ongoing work available for designers who perform well\n\r\n• Paid tests required before joining our team\n\r\nDesigners work at their own pace, as long as deadlines are met.\n\r\n________________________________________\n\r\nHow to Apply (Important)\n\r\nTo apply, include the word fancy at the top of your message.\n\r\nPlease also include:\n\r\n• Your YouTube thumbnail design experience (channels or niches)\n\r\n• 2–5 samples of your YouTube thumbnails (links or portfolio)\n\r\n• Two or more of your thumbnails optimized for mobile\n\r\n• The graphic design software you use\n\r\n• Your typical turnaround time for one thumbnail\n\r\n________________________________________\n\r\nPaid Test\n\r\nIf your application is selected, the first step in the process is to start with a paid test to determine your skills and capabilities and fit for our needs.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re looking for designers who want steady work and enjoy improving thumbnails to make them perform as well as possible.\n\r\n\n\r\nThanks — looking forward to seeing your work!\n\r\n________________________________________                ",

The team includes 3 Bay Area appraisers and 6 employees in the Philippines. We are rapidly growing and are looking for an experienced and senior level residential report writer/manager to join our team.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour role will be to do the following:\n\r\n1. Complete the entire residential appraisal report after the appraiser has provided you with the inspection information and comparables. This includes all the commentary, adjustments, and all other parts of the report. We will provide training on how we specifically expect the commentary and adjustments based on our own personal preferences, however you are expected to already have this type of experience working for other appraisers.\n\r\n2. Review the work of other report writers on our team, provide feedback, and help train newer report writers on our team. You are expected to act as the \"last line of defense\" of the report before it is sent to the appraiser for their final review before submission. As such, we expect you to be able to review the report, find any issues, correct these issues, and then send to the appraiser a near perfect report.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo be considered for this role, you must meet the following criteria:\n\r\n1. You have worked for a US residential appraiser\n\r\n2. You have experience performing data entry for residential properties in the US\n\r\n3. You have experience creating the 1004MC, selecting comparables, drawing the sketch, labeling photos, making adjustments to the sales grid, and making commentary for the addendum.\n\r\n4. Ideally, you have experience managing other appraisal report writers.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are flexible with your work hours and offer Philippine daytime shift hours for your convenience. We would like to start part time but then transition to full time, so ideally you are open to working full time exclusively with us if its a mutual fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo be considered for this position, you must do the following in your application message (failure to do all of the following will result in your application being ignored):\n\r\n1. How many years have you worked for a US residential appraiser? What tasks did you perform for them?\n\r\n2. How many hours does it take you to complete one report? What parts of the report do you complete?\n\r\n3. Do you have experience writing commentary for the addendum, drawing the sketch, labeling photos, and creating the 1004MC? Please indicate which ones you have experience with, and how many years for each.\n\r\n4. Please provide a sample of at least one appraisal report you have fully completed. You can redact any private information from the report. Please let me know what parts exactly you completed on this report(s).\n\r\n5. Provide a publicly accessible link to your resume.\n\r\n6. Are you open to starting part time and then transitioning to full time? Once working full time with us, will you be working exclusively with us without any other jobs? When is the earliest you can begin working with us?\n\r\n7. What are your preferred working hours?\n\r\n8. Do you have experience managing other residential appraisal report writers? If so, please discuss in detail your job responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you, and I look forward to the opportunity to work together.                ",

Your job is to turn that footage into engaging short-form videos, create multiple versions from the same recording, schedule posts, write captions, and track performance so we can repeat what works and improve what doesn’t. Instagram: \n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is primarily video editing for Reels and TikTok (potentially YouTube shorts as well) . You’ll take raw clips and produce clean, engaging edits with strong hooks, good pacing, and clear on-screen text. We want you to make different versions from the same footage (for example, different openings, text overlays, or endings) so we can test what performs best. You should be comfortable adding subtitles or captions, light sound design, and exporting in the right formats for both platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will also help with planning and consistency. Each week you’ll build a simple posting schedule, prepare content ahead of time, and schedule uploads with captions. We want someone who can contribute ideas for a practical posting strategy to drive followers and engagement, and who understands how short-form content works (hooks, retention, testing variations, and learning from analytics). The goal is steady growth and a repeatable content system that fits an art account.\n\r\n\n\r\nOrganization matters. You will create and maintain a Google Sheet to track what we post and how it performs. This should include the post date/time, video type, hook style, length, caption approach, hashtags, and performance results. Once per week, you’ll share a short summary of what performed best and your best guess as to why, plus what you recommend we test next.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a part-time role to start (around 10–20 hours per week) with flexible hours, as long as weekly deliverables and deadlines are met. We want to form this into a full-time role long term. Please include your rate (hourly or weekly/monthly). We are open to hourly at the beginning and moving to a fixed deliverables structure once the workflow is consistent. If we work hourly, we may use OnlineJobs.ph TimeProof during working time only, and we’re happy to reduce or remove tracking once we establish trust and consistent results.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please send a short intro and your relevant experience editing Reels/TikToks, plus 2–4 examples of short-form edits you’ve done (portfolio links are fine). Tell us what editing tools you use, your typical turnaround time, and what weekly posting cadence you would suggest for an art/collage account like ours. Include your rate and your availability to start.\n\r\n\n\r\nFinalists may be asked to do a small paid test using a short raw clip we provide. You would create two 10–20 second edit variations with different hooks/text/endings, and provide a caption and hashtags.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Do you have an eye for what makes people stop scrolling?\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run two media brands in the combat sports space. We have over 10 years of video content — thousands of hours of training footage, match clips, coaching sessions, and behind-the-scenes \nnts — sitting in a vault waiting to be turned into viral Shorts, Reels, and TikToks.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone obsessive about content to come in and systematically mine that library, find the gold, organize everything, and keep our social media engines running across multiple platforms and multiple brands every single day.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't a \"post once a day and call it done\" gig. You'll be the backbone of our entire content operation — the person who makes sure our video editor always has clips to cut, our content calendar is always full, and our audience is always being fed.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Two Brands You'll Be Working Across:\n\r\n\n\r\nBrand 1 — Championship-level amateur wrestling instruction with 10+ years of training footage. Think intense, high-energy, coach-to-athlete content.\n\r\n\n\r\nBrand 2 — Combat sports education and analysis. Deep library of instructional and analytical content.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing:\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Mining & Organization (This Is the Big One — ~40% of Your Time)\n\r\n- Systematically watch through our entire video libraries for both brands\n\r\n- Log every video in a master spreadsheet: title, duration, topic, key \nnts with timestamps, \"gold rating\" (1–5), and suggested clip ideas\n\r\n- Identify the \nnts that would make great Shorts — high energy technique demos, dramatic reactions, clean takedowns, quotable coaching \nnts, training montages, rivalry clips\n\r\n- Tag and categorize content: technique tutorials, match footage, training sessions, coaching/motivational, behind-the-scenes, product-specific\n\r\n- Organize raw files into a clean, labeled folder structure so our editor can find and grab what they need instantly\n\r\n- Maintain and update the content log as new footage comes in\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Scheduling & Posting (~30% of Your Time)\n\r\n- Manage content calendars across both brands and all platforms (YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok,\n)\n\r\n- Upload, write captions, add hashtags, and publish all finished content on schedule\n\r\n- Write captions from templates and brand voice guides we provide (you'll get trained on each brand's tone)\n\r\n- Schedule content in advance using tools like Metricool, Later, or native platform schedulers\n\r\n- Ensure we never miss a posting day — consistency is everything\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunity Engagement & Performance Tracking (~20% of Your Time)\n\r\n- Monitor and reply to comments across all platforms (we'll give you response guidelines)\n\r\n- Flag DMs and comments that need the founders' attention\n\r\n- Track basic performance metrics weekly: views, engagement rate, follower growth, saves, shares\n\r\n- Maintain a simple weekly report — what posted, what performed, what flopped, and why you think so\n\r\n- Identify trending content in our niches and flag opportunities to jump on trends\n\r\n\n\r\nResearch & Support (~10% of Your Time)\n\r\n- Research trending audio, formats, hashtags, and content styles in the wrestling and combat sports niche\n\r\n- Scout competitor accounts and flag content ideas worth adapting or responding to\n\r\n- Maintain asset libraries: thumbnails, brand templates, music/audio files, b-roll folders\n\r\n- Assist with miscellaneous tasks as needed — we're a small team and flexibility matters\n\r\n\n\r\nYou MUST Have:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong English skills (written — we communicate via chat, Loom, and shared docs)\n\r\n- Experience managing social media accounts and posting content consistently (show us the accounts you've managed)\n\r\n- Familiarity with at least one scheduling tool (Later, Buffer, Metricool, Hootsuite, or native platform schedulers)\n\r\n- Attention to detail — you'll be logging hundreds of videos and we need accuracy, not sloppiness\n\r\n- Ability to work independently with minimal supervision after training\n\r\n- A genuine eye for engaging content — you can tell the difference between a clip that will get 500 views and one that will get 50,000\n\r\n- Reliable internet and a quiet workspace with headphones (you'll be watching hours of video daily)\n\r\n- Willingness to overlap with US Central Time (CST) for at least 3–4 hours daily\n\r\n- Proficiency with Google Drive, Google Sheets, and basic file management\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Points (Not Required But We'll Love You For It):\n\r\n\n\r\n- Interest in wrestling, combat sports, or martial arts (understanding the content makes you faster)\n\r\n- Experience with short-form video platforms as a creator or avid consumer (if your own TikTok For You page is full of combat sports content, tell us)\n\r\n- Basic photo/video editing skills (even just CapCut-level trimming and captioning)\n\r\n- Experience with Canva for creating thumbnails or simple graphics\n\r\n- Familiarity with YouTube analytics, Instagram Insights, or TikTok analytics dashboards\n\r\n- Experience working with content creators or media brands (not just corporate social accounts)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat It's Like Working With Us:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Small team, fast-moving, zero bureaucracy\n\r\n- You'll work directly with the founders — not middle managers\n\r\n- We communicate async (Loom, Slack/chat) with a weekly sync call\n\r\n- We'll train you on exactly what \"gold\" content looks like — you don't need to figure it out alone\n\r\n- Clear expectations, direct feedback, and real growth opportunity\n\r\n- If you're great at this, there's room to grow into a content manager role as we scale\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply — READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe get a lot of applications. To make sure you actually read this post, do the following:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Start your application with the word **\"TAKEDOWN\"** so we know you read the full posting.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Watch this video: \n \n\r\n\n\r\n3. In your application, timestamp 3 specific \nnts from that video that you think would make great Shorts or Reels. For each \nnt, write 1-2 sentences explaining WHY you picked it — what makes it engaging, scroll-stopping, or shareable.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Send links to 2-3 social media accounts you've managed or contributed to. If you don't have professional examples, send your own personal accounts and tell us what content strategy you follow.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Tell us your available hours, timezone, and current workload (are you working other jobs?).\n\r\n\n\r\n**Do NOT send a generic application.** If your application doesn't start with \"TAKEDOWN\" and include timestamps, we won't read it.

    "description": "\n                    Fix Structured Data, Canonicals, H1 Issues + Improve CWV Performance\n\r\n\n\r\nHi! My name is Rhett and I'm the  Marketing Manager at The Equine Practice Company -\n\r\n\n\r\nI’m looking for an experienced Technical SEO Specialist to help fix several technical issues identified that we have with our website.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Equine Practice Company - a continuing education platform for equine veterinarians worldwide.\n\r\n\n\r\nLet me make this very clear before you apply.\n\r\n\n\r\n- This is not a content role or keyword research role.\n\r\n- This is a hands-on technical implementation project focused on:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Structured data (Schema / JSON-LD)\n\r\n- Entity linking (Organization ? Speakers)\n\r\n- Canonical + redirect consistency\n\r\n- Core Web Vitals performance improvements\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a one-time technical SEO implementation project (I'm estimating 1–2 weeks). I'd prefer a fixed-price structure with clear milestones. If the work is done well, I may offer ongoing technical SEO support for future schema + performance needs to this website and our second website.\n\r\n\n\r\nI want someone who can fix this properly and document the work clearly. \n\r\n\n\r\nA. Current Website Setup\n\r\n\n\r\nTo save time, here is our technical environment:\n\r\n\n\r\nWebsite platform: WordPress\n\r\nTheme: Kadence\n\r\nSEO plugin: Rank Math\n\r\nHosting: WPX (Cloudflare available)\n\r\nCanonical preference: I don’t mind www vs non-www - I just want one version enforced consistently\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Tasks\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Schema & Structured Data Implementation (High Priority) We currently have gaps in structured data, and we need a clean schema setup using best practices.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will implement:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Organization schema site-wide\n\r\n- AboutPage schema\n\r\n- ContactPage schema + ContactPoint\n\r\n- Person schema for our “Meet the Speaker” pages\n\r\n- Proper entity linking (Organization ? Website ? Speakers)\n\r\n\n\r\nI want a hybrid approach:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Rank Math for baseline schema\n\r\n- Custom JSON-LD where needed (especially for Speaker Person schema)\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant: Avoid duplicate/conflicting schema output.\n\r\n\n\r\nAll schema must be validated using:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Google Rich Results Test\n\r\n- \n Validator\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Homepage SEO Fix (H1 Hierarchy) - Our homepage currently has two H1 tags, which causes structural confusion for Google.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Fix the heading hierarchy (single clean H1)\n\r\n- Keep design intact (Kadence blocks)\n\r\n\n\r\nSuggested H1:\n\r\n\n\r\n“The Equine Practice Company – Continuing Education for Equine Veterinarians”\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Canonical + Domain Consistency (WWW vs Non-WWW) - We may have canonical duplication issues.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Audit canonical tags across templates\n\r\n- Enforce one preferred domain version via proper 301 redirects\n\r\n- Ensure Rank Math canonicals match server/CDN redirects\n\r\n- Confirm consistent indexing in Google Search Console\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Core Web Vitals + Performance Improvements (CWV) - Because this is a membership-based site, performance matters.\n\r\n\n\r\nI need help improving:\n\r\n\n\r\n- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)\n\r\n- TTFB (Time to First Byte)\n\r\n- INP / CLS issues if present\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Identify the top causes of poor CWV (mobile-first)\n\r\n- Optimize heavy scripts/plugins where possible\n\r\n- Recommend hosting/CDN improvements if needed\n\r\n\n\r\nRetest using:\n\r\n\n\r\n- PageSpeed Insights\n\r\n- Lighthouse\n\r\n- CrUX data\n\r\n\n\r\nIt is important that you document before/after results.\n\r\n\n\r\nMost Importantly, The Final Deliverables (What You Must Provide)\n\r\n\n\r\nAt completion of this project for our website, I expect:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Working JSON-LD schema for Organization, AboutPage, ContactPage, Person\n\r\n- Clean entity graph \n\r\n- Validation proof (screenshots or links)\n\r\n- Canonical + redirect mapping summary\n\r\n- Before/after homepage H1 structure proof\n\r\n- Core Web Vitals improvement report\n\r\n- Clear documentation of everything changed\n\r\n\n\r\n? Screening Questions (Required)\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply for this task, please answer these:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. What schema does Rank Math output by default, and how do you avoid duplication when adding custom Person schema?\n\r\n2. Where would you enforce the canonical domain version (WordPress vs Cloudflare vs server)?\n\r\n3. Share one example of Organization + Person JSON-LD you have implemented before (client details can be hidden).\n\r\n\n\r\nWho Is My Ideal Candidate - I'm looking for someone with:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong WordPress technical SEO experience\n\r\n- Deep schema + JSON-LD knowledge (not just plugins)\n\r\n- Experience with Rank Math + Kadence themes\n\r\n- Understanding of Core Web Vitals (TTFB/LCP)\n\r\n- Ability to work independently and document clearly\n\r\n\n\r\nTimeline\n\r\n\n\r\nI want this completed within 7–14 days, depending on scope and testing. If you are a real technical implementer (not just an SEO auditor), I’d love to work with you.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease apply with your answers to the screening questions and provide me with a fix price to complete this project on our website.

    "description": "\n                    The Real Estate Investment Underwriter is a core decision-maker responsible for evaluating residential properties across multiple exit strategies to determine whether a deal meets the company’s investment criteria. This role directly impacts company profitability by validating assumptions, stress-testing scenarios, and ensuring every approved deal has a clear, executable path to profit.  The Underwriter is the gatekeeper of company profitability. Every deal we do, or avoid, starts with this role. Strong underwriting protects the company from bad investments and ensures capital is deployed only where risk is understood and returns are justified.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Underwriter analyzes properties under three primary scenarios:\n\r\n\n\r\n1) Off-Market / Investor Sale (Cash)\n\r\n2) On-Market / As-Is Condition\n\r\n3) On-Market / Renovate & Resell at After Repair Value (ARV)\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is not theoretical — your numbers drive real capital deployment and are utilized for critical decisions.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe ideal DISC style is a High C / Mid D / Moderate S / Moderate I - someone who is obsessed with accuracy and data integrity, naturally skeptical of assumptions, strong at risk identification, comfortable slowing things down to get the numbers right, process oriented and analytical, loves numbers, and questions everything.  This person should be able to work independently and take ownership of outcomes while being able to defend their analysis/numbers if a deal does not work.  \n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\nInvestment Analysis & Deal Underwriting\n\r\n- Analyze residential properties to determine as-is value, investor value (off market), and After Repair Value (ARV)\n\r\n- Run detailed financial models for multiple exit strategies\n\r\n- Validate deal viability using company investment criteria (returns, risk, timelines)\n\r\n- Stress-test assumptions (pricing, repairs, hold time, market shifts)\n\r\n- Clearly determine DEAL / NO DEAL decisions on opportunities\n\r\n\n\r\nValuation & Market Analysis\n\r\n- Pull, analyze, and interpret comparable sales (on-market and off-market)\n\r\n- Adjust comps accurately for condition, location, timing, and renovations\n\r\n- Track market trends and pricing shifts to ensure current, defensible valuations\n\r\n- Evaluate neighborhood-level risk and liquidity\n\r\n\n\r\nRehab & Cost Analysis\n\r\n- Verify repair assumptions align with resale strategy and buyer expectations\n\r\n- Apply appropriate contingency and cost buffers to protect margins\n\r\n\n\r\nProfitability & Risk Management\n\r\n- Ensure every approved deal meets required profit margins and return thresholds\n\r\n- Account for all costs: acquisition, rehab, holding, financing, selling, and overhead\n\r\n- Identify deal-breakers early to protect time, capital, and resources\n\r\n- Flag high-risk variables before commitment\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunication & Decision Support\n\r\n- Present underwriting conclusions clearly to acquisitions, leadership, and partners\n\r\n- Defend valuations and assumptions with data and logic\n\r\n- Provide quick, confident feedback to support fast decision-making\n\r\n- Maintain underwriting documentation for accountability and post-deal review\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Skills & Experience\n\r\n- 2–5+ years in real estate underwriting, investing, acquisitions, or valuation\n\r\n- Strong understanding of:\n\r\n     - After Repair Value (ARV) methodology\n\r\n     - Investor pricing models (70% rule, margin-based underwriting, etc.)\n\r\n     - Rehab cost estimation\n\r\n     - Holding costs and deal timelines\n\r\n- Advanced proficiency in Excel / Google Sheets (financial modeling required)\n\r\n- Deep familiarity with MLS data, comps, and market analysis\n\r\n- Ability to thoroughly underwrite deals with detailed accuracy\n\r\n- High attention to detail with strong judgment under pressure\n\r\n\n\r\nIdeal Candidate Traits\n\r\n- Profit-driven thinker – understands that numbers = real dollars at risk\n\r\n- Decisive but disciplined – confident making DEAL / NO DEAL decisions\n\r\n- Skeptical by nature – pressure-tests assumptions instead of accepting them\n\r\n- Process-oriented – consistent underwriting methodology\n\r\n- Ownership mindset – treats company capital like their own\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\nPay rate: $8-$10 per hour, based on experience, plus bonus \n\r\nSchedule: 40 hours per week (It could be more based on workload)\n\r\nTraining: Yes, training will be provided.

I am hiring a long-term virtual assistant to publish new stencil content every week, improve SEO (especially thin-content issues), and help grow traffic and revenue. We provide a custom AI tool that can generate stencil images, so you will be using our tool as part of the workflow. The weekly output target is 3 new uploads per week, and each upload should contain 3 to 8 stencil images (a stencil set). The stencil sets must match current trends such as upcoming holidays, seasonal topics, and what people are searching for (Google search trends). You will publish each stencil set in WordPress by uploading the images, ensuring proper file naming and alt text, placing the content in the correct categories/tags, and adding internal links to relevant pages on the site.\n\r\n\n\r\nPinterest is also required: you will upload the images to our Pinterest account by creating Pins for each new stencil set (and sometimes individual stencils if appropriate), writing keyword-focused Pin titles and descriptions, linking back to the correct page on our website, and saving Pins to the right boards consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nA major focus for this role is improving thin pages. Many pages in this niche can become “thin” if they only contain an image and little text. You must learn how to improve page quality by adding helpful text, usage ideas, simple instructions, FAQs, better formatting, and stronger internal linking so each page provides real value beyond the download.

I am hiring a virtual assistant who can research accurately, write clearly, and publish SEO-optimized content consistently. The weekly output target is 3 to 5 posts per week.

You will write and format content in a user-friendly way, including clean headings, summaries, tables when helpful, and FAQ sections when appropriate. You will also do on-page SEO on every post by choosing correct keywords based on search intent, writing strong titles and headings, creating meta titles/descriptions when needed, and adding internal links to relevant pages on the site. You will also refresh and improve older posts to boost rankings, clarity, and usefulness.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role requires awareness that Google SEO changes and that some tactics stop working.

    "description": "\n                    We are seeking a true business owner in a management role, not an executor waiting for direction.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us\n\r\nWe are a Canadian manufacturer established in 1990. Our brands, Plastair, DeeVa, and PlastairFyre, are built on differentiated products, strong margins, and when appropriate, utility patents or design patents. We manufacture in Canada, or source electronics overseas, then protect and position them properly.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have a strong presence in brick and mortar retail in North America for decades. Now we are building a serious digital revenue engine.
