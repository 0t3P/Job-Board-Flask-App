    "description": "\n                    We are a fast-scaling DTC skincare brand on a mission to dominate the space. We don't just need a \"video editor\"; we need a Creative Catalyst who understands that an editor is the single most important person for a content engine.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are a technical wizard who thinks like a marketer, this is your chance to get in early with a brand that provides the resources for you to win.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? THE VISION\n\r\nMost brands treat editors like \"order takers.\" We don't. We believe the right editor has the biggest leverage in creating a winning ad. We are looking for a long-term partner who wants to grow with us—moving from per-batch work to a full-time role with massive bonuses, and eventually, a Creative Director or UGC Manager position.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? THE ROLE\n\r\n- Volume: 3 to 10 high-impact videos ads per week + variations for testing.\n\r\n- Direct Response Focused: You aren't just making \"pretty\" videos; you are building high-retention, cracked ads that convert.\n\r\n- The Workflow: We provide the scripts, raw B-roll, and audio to start. However, as you integrate, you will be expected to independently manage the AI workflow.\n\r\n- Sourcing: You must be able to source high-quality supplemental B-roll to fill gaps and enhance the narrative.\n\r\n- AI-Integration: You must be proficient in the modern AI stack (ElevenLabs, Veo, Kling, Runway, Sora, etc.) to enhance production value and speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR\n\r\nWe don't just prioritize \"insane editing skills\". We are looking for an editor who uses a timeline as a marketing tool.\n\r\n- Marketing DNA: You understand market awareness, consumer desires, avatars, and hooks.\n\r\n- Strategic Brain: You don't just wait for instructions; you research, brainstorm, and contribute strategy to the team.\n\r\n- Feedback Obsessed: You understand that an editor who has made a winning ad is miles apart from one who hasn't. You thrive on completing feedback loops to turn ads into winners.\n\r\n- Speed & Reliability: We are growing fast. You must be able to sustain a high-velocity editing pace without sacrificing quality.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? COMPENSATION & GROWTH\n\r\n- Trial Period: Paid per batch to ensure a perfect fit.\n\r\n- Full-Time Opportunity: We are actively looking for our \"First Hire\" anchor—if you prove your value, a competitive full-time role with a pathway to leadership + heavy bonuses is waiting.\n\r\n- Vision: We won't just pay you; we will give you the space to grow, the resources to succeed, and a pathway to leadership within the company.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? HOW TO APPLY\n\r\nDo not send a generic resume. To be considered, you must provide:\n\r\n- The Proof: A portfolio of Direct Response/E-com work (skincare or beauty preferred). *Mandatory*\n\r\n- The Marketing Mindset: Briefly explain why one of your past ads was a \"winner.\"\n\r\n- The AI Edge: Mention which AI tools you are currently using in your workflow.

Seeking a Marketing Operator to own campaigns, launches, and cross-channel execution alongside founders.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT ICOSA BREWHOUSE:\n\r\nICOSA Brewhouse is a globally recognized specialty coffee brand redefining how coffee is experienced. We are shaping coffee culture around the world. (\n  / \n )\n\r\n\n\r\nWe design and invent one-of-a-kind tools that didn’t exist before — tools that elevate everyday rituals and introduce new ways of enjoying coffee.\n\r\n\n\r\nFrom record-breaking Kickstarter launches to collaborations with world-class coffee professionals, our products are used by champions, in top cafés, and in homes in 100+ countries around the world. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a design-led, innovation-driven brand operating in a niche we are actively shaping. We build thoughtfully, test deliberately, and care deeply about quality — in both product and execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs we continue to innovate, launch new products, and grow, we are looking for a Senior Social Media & Marketing Manager to take ownership of how our work is brought to life across channels.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou won’t just publish content.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll help shape how new products are introduced, how campaigns are structured, and how our global community experiences our brand — while ensuring execution remains disciplined, consistent, and scalable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR ROLE AND OPPORTUNITY ON THE TEAM:\n\r\nThis is a senior marketing operator role. Execution is central — but it is not a junior content posting role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work directly with our Marketing Lead to:\n\r\n• Own day-to-day marketing delivery across core channels\n\r\n• Structure and execute campaigns from planning through rollout\n\r\n• Translate ideas into clear, executable briefs\n\r\n• Coordinate creative production across internal, outsourced, and AI-assisted workflows\n\r\n• Strengthen how our marketing engine operates over time\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will see early product prototypes.\n\r\nYou will contribute to campaign discussions before launch.\n\r\nYou will help shape how innovation is presented to a global audience.\n\r\n\n\r\nExecution is central to this role — but so is judgment, ownership, and the ability to think in campaigns rather than isolated posts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll own:\n\r\n\n\r\n(1) Marketing Execution Across Channels\n\r\n• Own social media execution (Instagram and\n).\n\r\n• Plan and manage content calendars aligned with brand positioning.\n\r\n• Ensure consistent publishing and follow-through across platforms.\n\r\n• Manage inbox and community engagement, including partnership or influencer communication if required.\n\r\n• Execute\n campaigns aligned with launches, promotions, and collaborations.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou ensure marketing execution remains structured, timely, and dependable.\n\r\n\n\r\n(2) Campaign Rollout & Launch Execution\n\r\n• Support and execute seasonal campaigns, product launches, collaborations, and promotional initiatives.\n\r\n• Translate marketing objectives into structured creative briefs.\n\r\n• Coordinate creative asset development across designers, freelancers, and AI-supported workflows.\n\r\n• Oversee cohesive cross-channel rollout so messaging, visuals, and timing align across social,\n, and paid efforts.\n\r\n• Strengthen campaign structure and rollout processes over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou think in campaigns — not just content pieces.\n\r\n\n\r\n(3) Creative Briefing & Quality Control\n\r\n• Create clear, structured briefs for design and content production.\n\r\n• Maintain high standards of aesthetic consistency, messaging clarity, and brand voice integrity across both human and AI-assisted workflows.\n\r\n• Draft copy or guide AI-assisted content creation when needed, ensuring outputs remain on-brand and high quality.\n\r\n• Review creative outputs for brand alignment before escalation to the Marketing Lead.\n\r\n• Collaborate comfortably in tools such as Figma or similar platforms to support execution and alignment.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou don’t need to be a designer — but you should have strong creative judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\n(4) Growth & Operational Development\n\r\n• Identify opportunities to refine workflows and strengthen how our marketing engine operates.\n\r\n• Lead or contribute to structured testing and rollout of new channels or initiatives as capacity allows.\n\r\n• Over time, take increasing ownership of campaign structuring, cross-channel coordination, partnership campaign oversight, and creative alignment across performance-driven efforts.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs you demonstrate reliability and judgment, your scope expands meaningfully.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat success looks like:\n\r\n• Social and\n channels operate smoothly with consistent execution and strong brand alignment.\n\r\n• Campaigns are rolled out in a coordinated, cross-channel manner without last-minute chaos.\n\r\n• Creative briefs are structured, clear, and reduce friction across collaborators.\n\r\n• Marketing execution no longer bottlenecks leadership attention.\n\r\n• Early experiments in new channels or initiatives are tested in a structured way.\n\r\n\n\r\nOver time, you become a trusted execution leader within the marketing team.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Is Not:\n\r\n• Not a pure content creator role.\n\r\n• Not a brand strategist role.\n\r\n• Not a paid media buyer role.\n\r\n• Not an administrative coordinator role.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a senior marketing operator position inside a growing global brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT YOU / WHO WE’RE LOOKING FOR:\n\r\nYou are someone who:\n\r\n• Understands how structured marketing campaigns come together.\n\r\n• Can translate ideas into clear execution plans.\n\r\n• Is comfortable owning delivery without hand-holding.\n\r\n• Is comfortable reviewing performance data and using insights to inform execution decisions.\n\r\n• Is strategic enough to think ahead — but practical enough to execute consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are strategic enough to think ahead — but practical enough to execute consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have skills or experience:\n\r\n• 4–6+ years of experience managing marketing and/or social for a brand.\n\r\n• Experience executing structured marketing campaigns.\n\r\n• Experience within D2C or product-based brands strongly preferred.\n\r\n• Comfortable operating inside e-commerce environments.\n\r\n• Highly detail-oriented and disciplined in follow-through.\n\r\n• Strong creative judgment and ability to assess content quality and brand alignment.\n\r\n• Comfort collaborating in design tools such as Figma.\n\r\n• Comfortable working directly with founders in a small, fast-moving team.\n\r\n\n\r\nBig pluses:\n\r\n• Experience supporting product launches or crowdfunding campaigns.\n\r\n• Experience creating, implementing, and refining marketing processes or building SOPs.\n\r\n• Experience coordinating freelancers or creative collaborators.\n\r\n• Familiarity with Klaviyo or similar\n platforms.\n\r\n• Exposure to AI-assisted marketing workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY JOIN US:\n\r\nAt ICOSA Brewhouse, you will:\n\r\n• Work directly with founders who are deeply involved in product design, positioning, and global campaigns.\n\r\n• Operate close to innovation — seeing products and launches before they are introduced to the world.\n\r\n• Contribute to campaigns that reach a global coffee audience.\n\r\n• Have real ownership inside a small, high-performing team where your work is visible and impactful.\n\r\n• Help shape coffee culture around the world.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a fully remote team — but we operate with structure and discipline.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be joining a close-knit group focused on building something meaningful with collaboration and accountability. There is no office politics. No unnecessary hierarchy. Just people committed to high standards.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe care deeply about growth — not just as a company, but as individuals. As we expand, there are real opportunities to take on broader ownership, lead initiatives, and shape how our marketing evolves.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want a role where:\n\r\n• Your ideas are heard.\n\r\n• Your execution matters.\n\r\n• Your scope can grow with your capability.\n\r\nYou will feel at home here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION AND WORKING STRUCTURE\n\r\nFull time: 40 hours/week \n\r\nCompensation range: $1,100-$1,800 (based on relevant experience and demonstrated capability)\n\r\nUp to 16 days of paid time off annually\n\r\nAsia time zone working hours required\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nAre you ready? \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’d like to join us on our journey and grow together with us, we’re looking forward to meeting you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe understand you may have a busy schedule, so we’ve made our application process extremely efficient. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please follow the steps below:\n\r\n1.

Instead, you should record separate videos of cooking and then doing the laundry, and upload both separately.\n\r\nIdeally, you should record a mix of tasks between 15-30 minutes long.\n\r\nThe space where you record your video should have excellent lighting.\n\r\nKeep the camera steady with minimal shaking.\n\r\nAll submitted footage must exclude any other individuals' faces unless they directly consent. Additionally, no third party music is permitted in the footage to avoid copyright violations.\n\r\nNo children should appear in the submitted footage.\n\r\nMinimize external noise during the recording–especially talking–so the audio of the task can be captured clearly and keep the camera as steady as possible throughout the recording.\n\r\nComplete each task from start to finish without walking away or leaving to do another task or take a break.\n\r\nTasks should be performed while either standing up, sitting on a chair/stool, not while sitting on the ground.\n\r\nPerform all activities in a controlled, slow manner.\n\r\nTo ensure that your footage meets the criteria mentioned above, before making your first official upload, you may need to record a few samples and then use the preview feature to watch them in the app and then discard them, since we currently do not have a way for you to see your footage as it's being recorded.

Seeking a Marketing Operator to own campaigns, launches, and cross-channel execution alongside founders.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT ICOSA BREWHOUSE:\n\r\nICOSA Brewhouse is a globally recognized specialty coffee brand redefining how coffee is experienced. We are shaping coffee culture around the world. (\n  / \n )\n\r\n\n\r\nWe design and invent one-of-a-kind tools that didn’t exist before — tools that elevate everyday rituals and introduce new ways of enjoying coffee.\n\r\n\n\r\nFrom record-breaking Kickstarter launches to collaborations with world-class coffee professionals, our products are used by champions, in top cafés, and in homes in 100+ countries around the world. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a design-led, innovation-driven brand operating in a niche we are actively shaping. We build thoughtfully, test deliberately, and care deeply about quality — in both product and execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs we continue to innovate, launch new products, and grow, we are looking for a Senior Social Media & Marketing Manager to take ownership of how our work is brought to life across channels.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou won’t just publish content.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll help shape how new products are introduced, how campaigns are structured, and how our global community experiences our brand — while ensuring execution remains disciplined, consistent, and scalable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR ROLE AND OPPORTUNITY ON THE TEAM:\n\r\nThis is a senior marketing operator role. Execution is central — but it is not a junior content posting role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work directly with our Marketing Lead to:\n\r\n• Own day-to-day marketing delivery across core channels\n\r\n• Structure and execute campaigns from planning through rollout\n\r\n• Translate ideas into clear, executable briefs\n\r\n• Coordinate creative production across internal, outsourced, and AI-assisted workflows\n\r\n• Strengthen how our marketing engine operates over time\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will see early product prototypes.\n\r\nYou will contribute to campaign discussions before launch.\n\r\nYou will help shape how innovation is presented to a global audience.\n\r\n\n\r\nExecution is central to this role — but so is judgment, ownership, and the ability to think in campaigns rather than isolated posts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll own:\n\r\n\n\r\n(1) Marketing Execution Across Channels\n\r\n• Own social media execution (Instagram and\n).\n\r\n• Plan and manage content calendars aligned with brand positioning.\n\r\n• Ensure consistent publishing and follow-through across platforms.\n\r\n• Manage inbox and community engagement, including partnership or influencer communication if required.\n\r\n• Execute\n campaigns aligned with launches, promotions, and collaborations.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou ensure marketing execution remains structured, timely, and dependable.\n\r\n\n\r\n(2) Campaign Rollout & Launch Execution\n\r\n• Support and execute seasonal campaigns, product launches, collaborations, and promotional initiatives.\n\r\n• Translate marketing objectives into structured creative briefs.\n\r\n• Coordinate creative asset development across designers, freelancers, and AI-supported workflows.\n\r\n• Oversee cohesive cross-channel rollout so messaging, visuals, and timing align across social,\n, and paid efforts.\n\r\n• Strengthen campaign structure and rollout processes over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou think in campaigns — not just content pieces.\n\r\n\n\r\n(3) Creative Briefing & Quality Control\n\r\n• Create clear, structured briefs for design and content production.\n\r\n• Maintain high standards of aesthetic consistency, messaging clarity, and brand voice integrity across both human and AI-assisted workflows.\n\r\n• Draft copy or guide AI-assisted content creation when needed, ensuring outputs remain on-brand and high quality.\n\r\n• Review creative outputs for brand alignment before escalation to the Marketing Lead.\n\r\n• Collaborate comfortably in tools such as Figma or similar platforms to support execution and alignment.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou don’t need to be a designer — but you should have strong creative judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\n(4) Growth & Operational Development\n\r\n• Identify opportunities to refine workflows and strengthen how our marketing engine operates.\n\r\n• Lead or contribute to structured testing and rollout of new channels or initiatives as capacity allows.\n\r\n• Over time, take increasing ownership of campaign structuring, cross-channel coordination, partnership campaign oversight, and creative alignment across performance-driven efforts.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs you demonstrate reliability and judgment, your scope expands meaningfully.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat success looks like:\n\r\n• Social and\n channels operate smoothly with consistent execution and strong brand alignment.\n\r\n• Campaigns are rolled out in a coordinated, cross-channel manner without last-minute chaos.\n\r\n• Creative briefs are structured, clear, and reduce friction across collaborators.\n\r\n• Marketing execution no longer bottlenecks leadership attention.\n\r\n• Early experiments in new channels or initiatives are tested in a structured way.\n\r\n\n\r\nOver time, you become a trusted execution leader within the marketing team.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Is Not:\n\r\n• Not a pure content creator role.\n\r\n• Not a brand strategist role.\n\r\n• Not a paid media buyer role.\n\r\n• Not an administrative coordinator

Figma.\n\r\n• Comfortable working directly with founders in a small, fast-moving team.\n\r\n\n\r\nBig pluses:\n\r\n• Experience supporting product launches or crowdfunding campaigns.\n\r\n• Experience creating, implementing, and refining marketing processes or building SOPs.\n\r\n• Experience coordinating freelancers or creative collaborators.\n\r\n• Familiarity with Klaviyo or similar\n platforms.\n\r\n• Exposure to AI-assisted marketing workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY JOIN US:\n\r\nAt ICOSA Brewhouse, you will:\n\r\n• Work directly with founders who are deeply involved in product design, positioning, and global campaigns.\n\r\n• Operate close to innovation — seeing products and launches before they are introduced to the world.\n\r\n• Contribute to campaigns that reach a global coffee audience.\n\r\n• Have real ownership inside a small, high-performing team where your work is visible and impactful.\n\r\n• Help shape coffee culture around the world.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are

    "description": "\n                    Instagram Growth Owner — Creator-First Distribution | Performance-First Ownership\n\r\nFull-time (40 hrs/week) · Remote · $1,200/month + Performance Bonuses\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT US\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're a calorie-and-macro-tracking app that feels like taking notes. Type what you ate in plain English (like \"eggs toast coffee\") or snap a photo and let AI estimate your calories and macros. No database rabbit holes. No friction.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur landing page: \n\r\n\n\r\nWe're hiring one person to own Instagram end-to-end with a clear bar: you must be able to produce positive ROI within 10 days.\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant: This is not a \"brand social\" role. It's not about Meta ad spend. This role is built around a creator-first growth system and distribution multiplication across multiple accounts.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\n\n\r\nYou own all Instagram operations. Here's what that means:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Creator Engine (Acquisition)\n\r\n- Source creators fast: fitness, meal prep, recipes, \"what I eat,\" weight loss, gym niches\n\r\n- Negotiate performance-based deals with minimal fixed fees and clear deliverables\n\r\n- Manage quality: scripts, hooks, filming guidelines, edits, posting requirements\n\r\n- Track outcomes via codes/links; maintain a clean pipeline in Sheets, Airtable, or Notion\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Distribution Multiplication (Scaling)\n\r\n- Take winning creator content and expand reach across owned accounts + partner pages\n\r\n- Turn one winning concept into many variations: new hooks, captions, crops, CTAs\n\r\n- Operate multiple themed accounts (recipes, meal prep, gym macros, etc.) with consistent cadence\n\r\n- Stagger posts intelligently — avoid duplication spam and build compounding account trust\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Creative Iteration (Speed)\n\r\n- Ship new creatives fast: hooks, scripts, briefs, edits, re-cuts\n\r\n- Build a \"winner playbook\" — when something hits, produce 10+ variations quickly\n\r\n- Maintain a testing cadence that's relentless, measurable, and not vibes-based\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Outbound Ops (Pipeline)\n\r\n- Run IG DM and\n outreach to creators, communities, and distribution partners\n\r\n- Build repeatable templates: outreach, follow-ups, negotiation, contracts, checklists\n\r\n- Keep your tracker/CRM clean with clear statuses and next actions\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE 2 KPIs YOU'LL OWN\n\r\n\n\r\nKPI #1: Day-10 Instagram Contribution ROI (cROI)\n\r\ncROI = Instagram-attributed revenue ÷ Instagram total spend (creator costs, editing, tools, boosting if used). Target: break-even or better (cROI ? 1.0) by Day 10, then improve and scale.\n\r\n\n\r\nKPI #2: Weekly Net-New Paying Subscribers from Instagram (NNPS-IG)\n\r\nFirst-time paying subscribers attributed to Instagram via trackable links, codes, or landing pages. Target: grow week-over-week while maintaining KPI #1.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: iOS attribution is imperfect. You're expected to build measurement that's honest, consistent, and decision-useful.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE IN YOUR FIRST 10 DAYS\n\r\n\n\r\n- A creator pipeline producing consistent deal flow with negotiated terms and scheduled posts\n\r\n- 10–20 creator videos in motion (live or scheduled) with tracking links/codes\n\r\n- A functioning distribution network: multiple accounts posting variations, not identical duplicates\n\r\n- Daily reporting loop: what shipped, what performed, what's being cut, what's being scaled\n\r\n- At least one repeatable path to cROI ? 1.0 with a plan to scale without ROI collapsing\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nMust Have:\n\r\n- Proven, revenue-accountable Instagram growth experience (creators + content systems + distribution)\n\r\n- Strong fundamentals: hook writing, creative direction, offer positioning, conversion instincts\n\r\n- Comfort operating under iOS attribution constraints without lying to yourself\n\r\n- Operator mindset: you ship fast, measure honestly, iterate without a big team\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Points:\n\r\n- Mobile subscription growth experience (trial-to-paid, payback windows, churn/LTV thinking)\n\r\n- UGC pipeline building (sourcing + scripting + editing workflow)\n\r\n- Multi-account content distribution without destroying trust signals\n\r\n- Strong taste in short-form content — you can feel what holds attention in the first 1–2 seconds\n\r\n\n\r\nYou Do NOT Need:\n\r\n- Prior experience with a calorie/macro app specifically\n\r\n- \"Influencer marketing\" as your only skill — this is an end-to-end growth system role\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\r\n\n\r\n- $1,200/month for ~40 hrs/week\n\r\n- Performance bonuses tied directly to ROI and subscriber growth\n\r\n- Payment via Wise (twice monthly)\n\r\n- Shape company culture and growth systems from day one\n\r\n- Collaborative Estonian team: regular syncs, high ownership, fast decisions\n\r\n- Fully remote — flexible hours with some overlap for syncs\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nStart your application with the letter X, then answer these two questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. A short note on how you'd get to positive ROI in 10 days using a creator-first distribution engine (no heavy reliance on paid ads).\n\r\n\n\r\n2. 1–2 examples of creator-led growth systems you've run. Include: what you shipped, how you tracked results, and how you scaled winners. Link to an IG account you grew or a screenshot of campaign results if you have one.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Summary\n\r\nI'm starting a new YouTube channel focused on AI, automation, and marketing. I'm looking for a talented video editor to help bring this channel to life.\n\r\n\n\r\n## What I Am Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nI need a video editor who can take raw scene clips and turn them into polished, engaging content — both as standalone Shorts and as a full-length YouTube video. You should be comfortable with motion graphics, on-screen overlays, and creating content that keeps viewers watching. I value speed, consistency, and a strong creative eye.\n\r\n\n\r\n## What You'll Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\nEach video consists of approximately 6 short scenes (100–120 seconds each). Your workflow for every video will be:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Take each individual scene (100–120 second clips) and edit them as standalone YouTube Shorts — clean transitions, text overlays, relevant graphics, and motion elements that make each Short feel polished and engaging on its own. Some videos will have fewer scenes since not all scenes will be ‘Short-worthy,’ but I record in 120-second increments, so the full video is around 8 minutes and will have around 6 scenes.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Merge all 6 edited scenes together into one cohesive long-form YouTube video with smooth transitions between scenes, consistent branding, and professional pacing.\n\r\n\n\r\nSo every deliverable set includes around 3–6 Shorts + 1 full YouTube video\n\r\n\n\r\n## Specific Skills Needed\n\r\n\n\r\nProficient in CapCut Pro (this is required — no exceptions). Motion graphics and animated overlays including lower thirds, callouts, kinetic text, and relevant on-screen graphics. Strong sense of pacing, transitions, and visual storytelling. Experience editing YouTube content specifically, with an understanding of retention, hooks, and platform best practices.
