    "description": "\n                    We're a high-growth digital fashion brand redefining online retail through bold aesthetics and ruthless creative efficiency. We move fast, test constantly, and believe exceptional visual storytelling drives conversion. As we scale across APAC markets, we're looking for a senior creative operator who treats design as a commercial weapon—not just decoration.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nYou'll own the entire visual ecosystem of a modern fashion e-commerce operation, from scroll-stopping social assets to high-converting\n campaigns. This isn't an \"execution-only\" role; you'll architect precision-crafted workflows that let us produce luxury-level creative at startup speed through mastery, not automation.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll be responsible for:\n\r\nCampaign Creative: Conceptualizing and producing visual assets for seasonal drops, sales campaigns, and product launches across Meta, TikTok, Google Ads, and programmatic display. You understand that every pixel must earn its place in the feed.\n\r\nRetention Design: Designing high-converting\n marketing templates (Klaviyo/Iterable), SMS graphics, and push notification visuals that maintain brand coherence while driving repeat revenue.\n\r\n\n\r\nSocial Velocity: Creating platform-native content (Instagram carousels, TikTok covers, Stories, Reels thumbnails) that respects current fashion aesthetics and platform algorithms. You know the difference between \"designed for Instagram\" and \"repurposed for Instagram.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nDigital Experience: Collaborating on website UI updates, landing page designs, and mobile-first merchandising layouts (Figma ? Shopify/Custom headless). You think in conversion funnels, not just grids.\n\r\nProduction Architecture: Building bulletproof design systems, scalable template libraries, and batch-production workflows that allow 50+ unique assets per week without sacrificing craft quality. You obsess over file hygiene, non-destructive editing, and component-based efficiency.\n\r\n\n\r\nAsset Management: Organizing rigorous file structures, version control, and handoff protocols that allow rapid iteration across multiple markets and languages without chaos.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\nNon-Negotiables:\n\r\n5+ years professional experience in digital design, with a portfolio demonstrating fashion, lifestyle, or premium e-commerce work (DTC brand experience strongly preferred).

You don’t need advanced skills or experience; you do need to be fast, accurate, and consistent on a computer.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour main tasks will be:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Use Meta Ads Library (we’ll provide the link and guidance)\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Scroll through ads using our keyword lists and filters\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Visit the advertised store and quickly understand what type of store it is\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Identify:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Fashion dropshipping stores (they sell products we can also find on AliExpress / similar suppliers)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Real fashion brands that design/produce their own items (we don’t count these as competitors)\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Log the approved competitors into a Google Sheet with the required details (URL, brand name, notes, etc.)\n\r\n\n\r\nUse a few Chrome extensions and simple online tools we’ll provide (for example, to check product sources or store details)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’ll give you clear examples and checklists, so you know exactly what to do.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey skill: spotting dropshippers vs real brands\n\r\nToday, many dropshipping stores try to look like “real brands” (thanks to AI, better design, etc.).\n\r\nYour most important job is to look past the nice design and figure out:\n\r\n\n\r\nIs this store selling generic products we could likely find on AliExpress or other common suppliers?\n\r\n\n\r\nThen we count them as competitors.\n\r\n\n\r\nOr are they clearly a real brand, designing and producing their own unique products? \n\r\n\n\r\nThen we do NOT count them as competitors.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will teach you what to look for, but you must be:\n\r\n\n\r\nCurious and observant\n\r\n\n\r\nWilling to follow the logic, not just the “vibe” of the website\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we expect from you\n\r\nYou do NOT need to be an expert in e-commerce. You do need:\n\r\n\n\r\nA fast and reliable laptop or desktop\n\r\n\n\r\nStable internet connection\n\r\n\n\r\nComfortable using Chrome, multiple tabs, and Chrome extensions\n\r\n\n\r\nBasic Google Sheets (copy/paste, fill in rows, no advanced formulas needed)\n\r\n\n\r\nFast and accurate when clicking, checking, and logging data\n\r\n\n\r\nBasic English reading so you can follow instructions and understand websites\n\r\n\n\r\nAbility to focus on repetitive work without losing accuracy\n\r\n\n\r\nReliability: if we agree on 1 hour/day, we expect you to actually show up and do it\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to have (but not required):\n\r\n\n\r\nAny experience with dropshipping, Shopify, AliExpress, or Meta Ads Library\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we offer \n\r\n\n\r\n100% remote – work from anywhere\n\r\n\n\r\n~1 hour per day (7 days/week or 5 days/week – we’ll agree together)\n\r\n\n\r\nPay: $2 per hour (simple and repetitive task) + Bonuses\n\r\n\n\r\nPossibility to get more hours in the future if we work well together\n\r\n\n\r\nTraining provided – we’ll show you exactly how to do the job\n\r\n\n\r\nSimple, clear, step-by-step tasks\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply\n\r\nPlease apply in English and include:\n\r\n\n\r\nA short introduction about yourself (1–3 sentences).\n\r\n\n\r\nYour laptop/PC specs (how old it is and if it runs fast with many tabs).\n\r\n\n\r\nA brief example of any repetitive or data-entry task you’ve done before (if any).\n\r\n\n\r\nIn 2–3 sentences, tell us how you would try to understand if a fashion store is a real brand or a dropshipping store, just based on looking at their website.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease use this subject line / title:\n\r\n\"Market Scraper – [Your Name]\"\n\r\n\n\r\nWe may start with a short paid trial (for example, 30–60 minutes of scraping) to see how you work and how well you follow the guidelines.

The goal is to build a cohesive image library that feels calm, warm, and emotionally aligned with mental health practices.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be working within an existing visual direction. This gig focuses on executing well within a defined style rather than inventing brand concepts from scratch.\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT US\n\r\n\n\r\nEmpathysites is a U.S.-based website service for psychotherapists. Since 2017, we’ve helped hundreds of therapists build websites that reflect their values and feel welcoming to clients.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur work prioritizes clarity, emotional sensitivity, and thoughtful design choices.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\n\r\n\n\r\n• Generate custom images using Midjourney or similar AI tools\n\r\n• Refine and prepare images using Photoshop, Affinity, or similar software\n\r\n• Create image sets that feel cohesive and consistent in tone\n\r\n• Follow creative direction and moodboards closely\n\r\n• Export organized, web-ready files\n\r\n\n\r\nThis project is focused on image creation, not logo design or full brand development.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED SKILLS\n\r\n\n\r\n• Experience using Midjourney or similar AI tools for photorealistic image generation\n\r\n• Strong image editing skills in Photoshop or similar software\n\r\n• Ability to match an existing visual style\n\r\n• Good eye for lighting, color harmony, and emotional tone\n\r\n• Organized file handling and naming\n\r\n\n\r\nNICE TO HAVE\n\r\n\n\r\n• Experience creating images for websites or marketing materials\n\r\n• Experience working within brand guidelines\n\r\n• Experience creating image sets, not just single images\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE RIGHT PERSON FOR THIS PROJECT\n\r\n\n\r\n• Pays close attention to detail\n\r\n• Can follow direction carefully and consistently\n\r\n• Communicates clearly and reliably\n\r\n• Is comfortable working independently and meeting deadlines\n\r\n\n\r\nPROJECT SCOPE\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a one-time project with a defined image batch to be created. We'll start with a smaller scale project and if it goes well, you will get the full project.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf collaboration goes well, there may be future project work, but there is no promise of ongoing work.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please include what AI image tools you are familiar with what your favorite movie is. Also include the following in your application:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. A link to your portfolio\n\r\n2. Your hourly rate or project rate\n\r\n3. A link to ONE image you believe would fit well on a therapist website and one or two sentences explaining why you chose that image\n\r\n\n\r\nSend an\n to \n with [Graphic Design Gig] in the subject - or just reply to our preexisting correspondence if we’ve already been in touch.

    "description": "\n                    Hi, I’m Loic, the founder of a US based skincare brand for women 50+.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a fast-growing, US-based direct-to-consumer skincare brand. We create premium, high-science body care specifically designed for women 50+ experiencing hormonal skin changes.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are entering a critical growth phase, and I am looking for a sharp, empathetic, and highly reliable Customer Experience Specialist to be my right hand in managing our customer inbox.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur brand voice is warm, professional, and deeply empathetic. Our customers are mature women who want to be heard, respected, and taken care of. If you have a robotic, corporate tone, this is not the role for you. If you genuinely love solving problems and turning a frustrated customer into a brand advocate, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Reality of the Role:\n\r\nYou will be the first point of contact for our customers via\n.\n\r\nWhile I provide detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and\n templates, this is not a brainless copy-paste job. You will need to use judgment to adapt templates, investigate tracking issues, handle refund requests gently, and know exactly when to escalate an urgent issue (like a chargeback threat) directly to me.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Do:\n\r\n\n\r\nInbox Management: Monitor and respond to all customer service\ns within 2-4 hours during your shift (US EST hours).\n\r\n\n\r\nProblem Solving: Handle \"Where is my order?\", cancellations, returns, and damaged product claims with grace and accuracy.\n\r\n\n\r\nData Integrity: Meticulously log order numbers, tracking updates, and issue patterns into our daily tracking spreadsheet.\n\r\n\n\r\nDefense: Monitor aggressively for chargeback threats or payment disputes and alert me immediately so we can protect the business.\n\r\n\n\r\nFeedback Loop: Submit a simple weekly report highlighting customer confusion, recurring complaints, or suggestions to improve our SOPs.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are:\n\r\n\n\r\nFluent & Natural English: You write clearly and warmly without sounding like a textbook.\n\r\n\n\r\nHigh Emotional Intelligence: Angry customers don't rattle you. You know how to de-escalate a situation.\n\r\n\n\r\nMeticulous: You double-check tracking numbers and never make a promise (like a refund) without checking the policy first.\n\r\n\n\r\nTech-Comfortable: You have experience with Shopify, Gmail, Google Docs, Gorgias, Commslayer and standard e-commerce tools.\n\r\n\n\r\nEquipped: You have a quiet workspace and highly reliable internet.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Provide:\n\r\n\n\r\nDirect access and communication with me (the Founder). No middle management.\n\r\n\n\r\nA respectful, supportive environment where your feedback actually matters.\n\r\n\n\r\nRoom to grow into a full-time, expanded role as the company scales.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? HOW TO APPLY (Read Carefully) ????\n\r\n\n\r\nWe ignore all generic, AI-generated applications. To prove you read this and have the attention to detail required for the job, you must follow these exact steps:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. The Subject Line:\n\r\nMake the subject line of your application: \"Skin CX: [Insert Your Favorite Color]\"\n\r\n\n\r\n2. The Video Intro (Required):\n\r\nRecord a 1 to 2-minute Loom video (or similar screen recording link) introducing yourself. Tell me why you want to work for a skincare brand targeting mature women, and briefly describe a time you turned an angry customer into a happy one. Applications without a video link will be instantly deleted.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. The Skin Writing Test:\n\r\nImagine a customer named Susan\ns us: \"I bought your Undaria body oil 2 weeks ago and I am furious. The ad said immediate results, but my arms are still crepey and sagging! I want my money back right now, this is a scam.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nWrite exactly how you would reply to Susan.\n\r\n(Hint: Remember our brand voice. Acknowledge her frustration, explain gently that while hydration is instant, rebuilding skin density takes 30-45 days, and offer her our 100% refund guarantee if she finishes the bottle and still isn't happy).\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease attach your resume and send your application following the steps above. I look forward to meeting you!\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy this version will get you better talent:\n\r\nThe Loom Video Filter: This is the ultimate AI killer. Lazy applicants or people using bots physically cannot generate a personalized 60-second video speaking directly to \"Loic about Skin.\" You will immediately cut your applicant pool down, but the ones remaining will be top-tier.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe \"Trick\" Test: Instead of a generic \"where is my order\" test (which ChatGPT can answer perfectly), the writing test asks them to handle the exact \"Hydration vs. Structure\" objection you deal with daily. It forces them to actually read the prompt and show real empathy.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Tone: It sounds like a real founder protecting her business, which attracts A-players who respect strong leadership.

    "description": "\n                    ABOUT US\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're a comedy content brand based in Auckland, New Zealand with 3.5 million followers across social media. Our content is currently focused on shortform trends with plot twists, remaking viral videos funnier, and slow-motion dramatic skits that has dabbled in the longform space but want to execute more there. We move fast, we make people laugh, and everything we do has a creative angle.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're looking for ONE experienced, creative, and socially plugged-in video editor to own the post-production side of this operation. This is not an entry-level role. We need someone who has been in the trenches, understands pacing, and genuinely gets what makes people laugh online.\n\r\nThis role starts as a paid freelance test project with the goal of becoming a long-term, full-time position for the right person.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS ROLE?\n\r\nEditing comedy is not the same as editing any other content. A cut half a second too late kills a joke. A sound effect dropped in the wrong \nnt ruins a bit. If you've only ever edited corporate videos or travel vlogs, this probably isn't the role for you.\n\r\nWe need someone who lives on the internet, knows what's trending in \n culture right now, and understands instinctively why something is funny - not just how to make it look clean.\n\r\nIf you know exactly what the \"FAAAAH\" sound effect is, when to use it, and more importantly when it's been overused - you're already speaking our language.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role has a clear weekly workload across two content types:\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUTUBE - Primary Focus\n\r\n\n\r\nEach week you'll receive one YouTube video (currently 10–20 minutes final output, potentially longer over time) along with a written edit brief from the talent. The brief will include timestamps, instructions, tone direction, and any specific \nnts to highlight or cut around.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour deliverables for each YouTube video:\n\r\n* Full edited YouTube cut — clean, punchy, comedy-timed, with motion graphics and text animations where needed\n\r\n* Two short-form cuts reformatted from the YouTube video for other platforms (vertical, optimised for social)\n\r\n* Subtitles and captions included and accurate \n\r\nTurnaround: First cut delivered within 1.5–3 days of receiving footage.\n\r\n\n\r\nSHORT-FORM INSTAGRAM SKITS — Secondary Focus\n\r\nEach week you'll also receive approximately 5-10 short-form Instagram skit videos (9:16 vertical format). These are simpler edits — but they still need to be sharp, well-paced, and feel native to the platform.\n\r\nTurnaround: Within 24 hours of receiving footage during your working hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nMOTION GRAPHICS & ANIMATIONS\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a core part of the role, not an afterthought. Roughly 20% of every YouTube video will involve custom motion graphics, text animations, and visual effects. The style benchmark is:\n\r\n* Airrack — absurd VFX, masking, and visual gags\n\r\n* Ryan Trahan — simple, clean, well-timed animations\n\r\n* Will Tennyson — clean graphics, natural pacing, personality-driven editing (This is the preferred style)\n\r\nIf you can't look at those three channels and immediately understand the aesthetic, this isn't the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nWORKING RELATIONSHIP\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll be working inside Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects — these are non-negotiable. No exceptions.\n\r\nThe talent is also an advanced editor. He will review your cut, make final touches directly inside the project file, and occasionally adjust timing, graphics, or colour. You need to be comfortable with your work being opened, refined, and built on — this is a collaboration, not a handoff.\n\r\nYou'll have access to the brand's music libraries and VFX asset libraries via provided login credentials. You're you're welcome to use these and any other libraries that you may have a subscription for. ?\n\r\nHARD SKILLS (Required)\n\r\n\n\r\n* Adobe Premiere Pro — strong confidence here, non-negotiable\n\r\n* Adobe After Effects — animations, masking basics, non-negotiable\n\r\n* Photoshop basic skills is expected \n\r\n* Motion graphics and text animation — basic animation skills or working with templates, non-negotiable\n\r\n* Short-form content editing — vertical format, platform-native pacing\n\r\n* Subtitles and captions — accurate, well-timed, cleanly formatted\n\r\n* File management — organised project files that another editor can open and navigate easily?\n\r\nHARD SKILLS (Strong Bonus)\n\r\n* 2D animations and custom graphic design\n\r\n* 3D is not required but would be an exceptional bonus??\n\r\nSOFT SKILLS (Required)\n\r\n* Genuine sense of humour — you understand comedy timing instinctively\n\r\n* Deeply plugged into internet culture, \ns, and what's trending in the social media space right now\n\r\n* Self-driven and reliable — you hit your turnaround times without being chased\n\r\n* Strong communicator — you ask smart questions before starting, not after delivering\n\r\n* Receptive to direction — you can take a detailed brief and execute it faithfully without ego\n\r\n* Detail-oriented — nothing ships with errors you could have caught yourself\n\r\n\n\r\nEXPERIENCE (Required)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not looking for a new or junior editor. We need someone who has worked with YouTubers or social media creators before and can demonstrate that experience. A portfolio or showreel is required with your application — applications without one will not be considered. If providing a YouTube link with your work you must be credited on the video as proof\n\r\nComedy content experience is a strong bonus. If you've edited comedy skits, reaction content, or \n-heavy videos before, tell us about it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWORK HOURS\n\r\n\n\r\nFull-time, 40 hours/week. Flexible hours with reasonable overlap (not mandatory) with NZ business hours (9am–5pm NZST) for communication and feedback turnarounds. \n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nInclude ALL of the following or your application will not be considered:?\n\r\n1. Brief intro — who you are, your editing background, and why you're the right fit for a comedy content brand.\n\r\n2. Your portfolio or showreel — this is non-negotiable. Show us your best work. If you have specific examples of YouTube edits, short-form content, or motion graphics work, highlight those. Comedy content examples will stand out. Please list any content creators you might have worked with before. \n\r\n3. Software and tools — confirm you use Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects. List any other tools or plugins you are familiar with??\n\r\n4. The Comedy Timing Test:?\n\r\nThis is the most important part of your application. Watch this clip: [you will insert a short clip here — a simple talking head or reaction \nnt from one of your videos]?\n\r\nTell us:\n\r\n* Where would you place a cut, a sound effect, or a graphic to make this \nnt funnier?\n\r\n* What sound effect or \n reference would you use and why?\n\r\nThere's no single right answer. We want to see how your brain works when it comes to comedy editing. If your answer references something that was relevant two years ago but is completely dead now, that tells us something too.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. The Culture Test:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe want to know you're actually plugged into what's happening online right now — not six months ago.\n\r\nWhat’s one \n sound that is working on the internet right now? ?What’s one \n image that is working on the internet right now????\n\r\n6. Your expected monthly salary in USD.?\n\r\n7. Your available start date.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're building something genuinely fun here. If you're a sharp editor who gets comedy, lives on the internet, and takes real pride in making content that makes people laugh — we want to hear from you. ????                ",

The Mission\n\r\nWe are a faith-rooted multi-business operation (commercial roofing, virtual assistant services, and growing brands) and we need someone who can make Go High Level actually work ... not just poke around in it. This is a fractional engagement: 1 to 3 months to get all the pipes and wires flowing, then evaluate for ongoing support.\n\r\n\n\r\n? Required Skills\n\r\n1. Go High Level (GHL) administration: custom fields, pipelines, workflows, triggers, automations, forms, and landing pages\n\r\n2. \n scenario building: webhook triggers, API connections, and data transformations\n\r\n3. N8N workflow building: self-hosted preferred, API integrations, and data routing\n\r\n4. Landing page and funnel building inside GHL\n\r\n5. Integration experience: Dropbox, transcription tools,\n/SMS automation, and calendar systems\n\r\n6. Comfortable reading API documentation and configuring webhooks\n\r\n\n\r\n? Bonus Skills (Nice to Have)\n\r\n1. GHL App Marketplace and third-party plug-ins (mapping, heat tracking,\n deliverability)\n\r\n2. Experience with Klaviyo or similar\n deliverability platforms\n\r\n3. Familiarity with AI/LLM API integrations (Claude, OpenAI)\n\r\n\n\r\n???? First 30 Days — Deliverables\n\r\nThis is not a vague role. Here is exactly what gets built:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Audit current GHL setup. Document what is broken, missing, and working. Deliver a written findings report.\n\r\n2. Build custom fields: avatar type (Meg / Bill / Kenny / Nance / Val), enthusiasm score / heat index (0–200), material type, solution tier, proposal status, multi-location flag, golden\n, lead source, cost per lead.\n\r\n3. Build pipeline stages matching the 10-phase proposal pipeline from the SOP.\n\r\n4. Build the transcription pipe: Audio ? Transcription ? Claude API ? Structured JSON ? GHL fields via \n or N8N.\n\r\n5. Connect landing pages (\n and \n) to GHL lead capture.\n\r\n6. Build splash pages for $100/day social media ad campaigns so leads do not evaporate at the click.\n\r\n7. Import and clean 3,600 building records into GHL as contacts with proper tagging by industry, city, and roof size.\n\r\n8. Set up follow-up sequences: after proposal sent, after video viewed, after 7-day no response, and after 30-day no response.\n\r\n9. Implement lead source tracking: Referral, Physical Marketing (flyer/brochure), Door-to-Door, Call-In from Mailer, Digital/Social (by platform), Blog Download. Every lead must have a source and a CPL attached.\n\r\n10. Set up Wednesday newsletter automation: GHL\n campaign ships at 9 AM CST every Wednesday. Evaluate Klaviyo or similar if GHL\n bounce rates are too high.\n\r\n11. Implement heat index scoring system (0–200 enthusiasm scale across all contacts). \n\r\n12. Implement field mapping/tracking plug-in for geographic lead visualization.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Who You Are\n\r\n1. You have built inside GHL before — not just poked around in it. You have shipped working automations.\n\r\n2. You think in systems. You see a broken process and immediately start mapping how to fix it end-to-end.\n\r\n3. You communicate clearly in writing. We are a remote team and documentation matters.\n\r\n4. You are self-directed. You do not need hand-holding on every task — but you ask great questions when you need clarity.\n\r\n5. You are comfortable with ambiguity. We are a growing operation and some things are not fully defined yet. That is part of the job.\n\r\n6. You are aligned with a faith-rooted, purpose-driven business culture. We operate with integrity, care for our people, and want our work to matter.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? How to Apply\n\r\nSend the following to our team:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. A short video (2–5 minutes) walking us through a GHL workflow, \n scenario, or N8N pipeline you have built. \n\r\nShow us your work.\n\r\n2. Your resume or a brief written summary of relevant experience.\n\r\n3. One sentence on why this role fits where you are right now.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications without a video or work sample will not be reviewed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not looking for someone to figure it out. We are looking for someone who already knows ... and is ready to build.                ",

    "description": "\n                    ABOUT US\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're a comedy content brand based in Auckland, New Zealand, with 3.5 million followers across social media. Our content is trends with plot twists, remaking viral videos funnier, and skits. We're not a corporate media company. We move fast, we make people laugh, and everything we do has a creative angle.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're looking for ONE sharp, creative, and self-driven person to become the backbone of this operation. You'll handle the research, planning, and creative ideation that makes content happen — so that when the talent shows up, all he has to do is perform.\n\r\nThis role starts as a paid freelance test project with the goal of becoming a long-term, full-time position for the right person.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a data entry job. This is not just a research job. The most valuable thing you will do is watch what's trending and tell us how WE make a better, funnier version of it.\n\r\nIf you can find a video with 40M views and say \"here's exactly why this worked, and here's how we make it funnier with our style\" — you're the person we're looking for.\n\r\nCreative thinking comes first. Organisation is what makes it happen.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO?\n\r\n\n\r\nAREA 1:\n — Viral Video Research (Daily)\n\r\n\n\r\nEvery day, source and deliver 20 viral videos suitable for reaction-style content. These are videos the talent will react to on camera — so they need to be genuinely compelling, funny, controversial, or emotionally charged enough to get a real reaction.\n\r\nYour first stop for finding these is Reddit and X \n). Secondary sources are\n, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. We want content that's breaking or peaking — not videos that have already saturated every platform.\n\r\nDeliver daily in a shared spreadsheet or Notion board with:\n\r\n* Video link\n\r\n* Platform and metrics (views, shares, comments — whatever is available)\n\r\n* A brief note on why it's a strong reaction candidate?\n\r\n\n\r\nAREA 2: INSTAGRAM — Viral Video Research (Daily)\n\r\n\n\r\nEvery day, source and deliver 10 viral videos suitable for us to recreate or shoot our own version of. These are videos we'll put our own twist on — so look for concepts that translate well to our style: trends with plot twists, remaking things funnier, slow-motion dramatic skits.\n\r\nAgain, Reddit and X are your first stop. Then secondary platforms.\n\r\nDeliver daily in the same shared board with:\n\r\n* Video link\n\r\n* Platform and metrics\n\r\n* A brief note on why this is a strong recreation candidate and what angle we could take?\n\r\n\n\r\nAREA 3: YOUTUBE — Weekly Concept Pitches & Production Execution\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is the most creative and involved part of the role. It runs on a clear weekly cycle:\n\r\nMonday — You deliver 5–8 YouTube video concepts. Each concept must include:\n\r\n* The core idea and angle — what's the video and why will it perform?\n\r\n* The hook — what grabs the viewer in the first 3 seconds?\n\r\n* The payoff — what makes them stay until the end?\n\r\n* Thumbnail concept — what does the thumbnail look like? What's the text, the visual, the emotion?\n\r\n* Rough script outline — key beats, \nnts, or scenes in bullet-point form\n\r\nTuesday — Approvals are returned within 24 hours. 1–2 concepts will be selected.\n\r\nTuesday through Friday — You execute. Once a concept is approved, your job is to make it happen. This means:\n\r\n* Researching and booking locations\n\r\n* Making calls to NZ businesses (we'll provide a NZ virtual phone number)\n\r\n* Coordinating any talent or collaborators\n\r\n* Sourcing props or permissions if needed\n\r\n* Building a full shoot day schedule so that when the talent arrives, everything is ready\n\r\nYou are the producer. The talent shows up and performs. Everything else is on you.?\n\r\n\n\r\nAREA 4: CONTENT LANDSCAPE MONITORING (Weekly)\n\r\n\n\r\nEach week, deliver a brief report on what's gaining traction in our content space broadly — what formats, trends, or styles are picking up \nntum across platforms. This isn't about tracking specific creators. It's about keeping us ahead of what's coming so we're never late to a trend.\n\r\nThis doesn't need to be long. A sharp, well-organised one-pager with your key observations and any opportunities you see for us is enough.\n\r\n\n\r\nHARD SKILLS (Required)\n\r\n\n\r\n* Strong English — written AND spoken (phone calls to NZ businesses required)\n\r\n* Excellent research skills with Reddit and X as your primary tools, and\n, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok as secondary\n\r\n* Deep familiarity with social media metrics and what actually drives performance at scale\n\r\n* Experience with Notion, Google Sheets, or similar tools\n\r\n* Ability to analyse content and extract creative insights — not just surface-level observations\n\r\n* Basic understanding of video production workflows and shoot day logistics\n\r\n\n\r\nSOFT SKILLS (Required)\n\r\n\n\r\n* Creative thinker — you have opinions about content, not just observations\n\r\n* Proactive and self-driven — you don't wait to be told what to do\n\r\n* Highly organised — you're managing daily deliverables and a weekly production cycle simultaneously\n\r\n* Strong communicator — you flag problems early, ask smart questions, and give clear updates\n\r\n* Reliable — you deliver on time, every time\n\r\n* Calm under pressure — when a shoot is two days away and something falls through, you solve it\n\r\n\n\r\nNICE TO HAVE\n\r\n\n\r\n* Previous experience working with a YouTuber or content creator\n\r\n* Knowledge of the reaction content space\n\r\n* Familiarity with NZ culture, slang, or local context\n\r\n* Experience with production coordination, location scouting, or scheduling\n\r\n* Capcut or basic editing skills\n\r\n\n\r\nWORK HOURS\n\r\n\n\r\nFull-time, 40 hours/week. Flexible hours, but you must have at least 3–4 hours of overlap with NZ business hours (9am–5pm NZST) for communication and phone calls. For Philippines time, this means being available roughly 4am–8am PHT or adjusting your schedule accordingly.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nInclude ALL of the following or your application will not be considered:\n\r\n1. Brief intro — who you are and why you're a good fit for this specific role.\n\r\n2. Your experience with content research, social media, or production co-ordination work?\n\r\n3. The Creative Test — this is the most important part of your application:\n\r\nFind two short-form videos that you believe are going viral right now or have recently. For each video:\n\r\n* Provide the link\n\r\n* Provide the social media metrics \n\r\n* Tell us why YOU think this video is viral. What's driving it? What made people share it?\n\r\n* What's one thing that could have made it even better?\n\r\n* How would YOU remake this video in our style? Give me a rough concept in 3–5 bullet points?\n\r\nWe want to understand how you think about performance and scale, so be specific about the numbers and what they mean to you.?\n\r\n\n\r\n4. The Attention Test:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe get a lot of applications. Most people don't read this far. To prove you did, answer this question somewhere in your application:\n\r\n\"If you could only eat one fruit for the rest of your life, what would it be and why?\"\n\r\nNo right answer. Bonus points if it's funny.?\n\r\n5. Your expected monthly salary in USD.?\n\r\n6. Your available start date.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're building something genuinely fun here. If you're obsessed with what goes viral, you have creative opinions, and you're the type of person who makes things happen behind the scenes — we want to hear from you. ????                ",

We use modern systems and automation to run a tight, efficient practice — and we need the right person to help us keep that \nntum going.\n\r\n\n\r\n## The Role\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're looking for a sharp, dependable **Executive Virtual Assistant** who will work directly alongside the Clinic Owner on a daily basis. This isn't your typical VA role — you'll be involved in the day-to-day operations of a fast-growing healthcare practice, managing key systems, and helping keep everything running smoothly behind the scenes.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're someone who thrives under pressure, takes ownership of tasks without being micromanaged, and wants to grow alongside a company that's scaling — this is your opportunity.\n\r\n\n\r\n## What You'll Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\n- Managing the Owner's calendar, inbox, and daily priorities\n\r\n- Building and managing workflows, automations, and campaigns inside **GoHighLevel (GHL)**\n\r\n- Coordinating tasks across the front desk, marketing, and operations\n\r\n- Organizing and maintaining SOPs, project trackers, and internal documentation\n\r\n- Handling patient inquiry follow-ups, appointment reminders, and reactivation campaigns\n\r\n- Tracking KPIs, pulling reports, and keeping leadership informed on key metrics (new patients, show rates, revenue, etc.)\n\r\n- Anticipating needs and solving problems before they become issues\n\r\n- Supporting marketing campaigns, promotions, and community outreach efforts\n\r\n\n\r\n## What We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n**Must-Haves:**\n\r\n- Proven experience with **GoHighLevel** (workflows, pipelines, automations, campaigns)\n\r\n- Highly organized with strong attention to detail\n\r\n- Critical thinker who can problem-solve independently\n\r\n- Ability to perform under pressure and manage competing priorities\n\r\n- Excellent written and verbal English communication\n\r\n- Trustworthy, reliable, and committed — this role requires discretion and accountability\n\r\n- Experience working directly with a business owner or executive-level leader\n\r\n\n\r\n**Nice-to-Haves:**\n\r\n- Familiarity with Notion, Slack, Google Workspace, or other project management tools\n\r\n- Background in healthcare, wellness, or service-based businesses\n\r\n- Experience managing teams or coordinating between departments\n\r\n- Basic understanding of sales funnels, CRM management, and lead tracking\n\r\n- Knowledge of HIPAA-compliant communication practices\n\r\n\n\r\n## Why This Role Is Different\n\r\n\n\r\nYou won't be buried in busywork.

To Apply:\n\r\nComment “ARCHITECT” or DM with:\n\r\n • Platforms you’ve built funnels in\n\r\n • One example of a system you owned end-to-end\n\r\n • How you think about reducing no-shows and improving show rates\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re building long-term infrastructure.\n\r\nIf you want short-term gigs, this isn’t it.

    "description": "\n                    About Us\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a growing agency that helps businesses automate everything — lead generation, marketing, client onboarding, internal operations, content creation, and more. We work with law firms, insurance agencies, financial advisors, IT companies, and other professional service businesses. Our edge is that we do not just offer one service. We look at a business, identify every process that is repetitive, manual, or slow, and we build AI-powered systems that handle it automatically.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone who thinks in systems. Someone who hears \"I spend 3 hours a day doing X\" and immediately knows how to make it happen in 3 minutes. Someone who is obsessed with connecting tools, building workflows, and using AI to eliminate busywork across every part of a business.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a \"set up a Zapier zap\" role. We build complex, multi-step, AI-driven automation systems that run entire business operations. If you have only built simple two-step automations, this role is not for you. If you have built systems that made people ask \"how the hell does this work?\" — keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Do\n\r\n\n\r\nYour job is to look at any business process — ours or our clients' — and figure out how to automate it. The scope is broad on purpose. Here are the categories of work you will own:\n\r\n\n\r\nAI-Powered Business Automation (40% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will design and build automated systems that replace manual work across every part of our business and our clients' businesses. This includes but is not limited to:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nLead generation pipelines: Automated scraping, enrichment, AI-powered hyper-personalization, and campaign deployment — so leads flow in without anyone touching a spreadsheet.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nClient onboarding workflows: When a new client signs up, automated sequences that collect their information, set up their accounts, send welcome materials, and schedule kickoff calls — without a human doing any of it.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nCRM and pipeline management: Automated lead categorization, follow-up scheduling, deal stage updates, and alert systems that notify the right person at the right time.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nDocument and proposal generation: AI-powered systems that take client data and automatically generate custom proposals, reports, or deliverables.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nInternal operations: Automated reporting dashboards, task assignment systems, performance tracking, and anything else that currently requires someone to manually update a spreadsheet or send a Slack message.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will use whatever tools the job requires — Make (Integromat), n8n, Zapier, custom Python/Node.js scripts, Google Apps Script, or direct API integrations. You pick the right tool for the job.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Content & Social Media Automation (25% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will build and manage automated content creation and distribution systems. This includes:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nAutomated video generation: Using platforms like HeyGen, Synthesia, Pictory, or similar tools to generate AI avatar videos, repurpose long-form content into short clips, and produce video content at scale without a production team.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nSocial media scheduling and posting: Building automated pipelines that generate social media content using AI (captions, hashtags, image selection), schedule posts across multiple platforms, and adapt content format for each channel (LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok,\n, X).\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nContent repurposing engines: Systems that take one piece of content (a blog post, a podcast episode, a video) and automatically break it into 10-20 pieces of social content — different formats, different platforms, different angles — all generated and scheduled without manual work.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nAI-powered copywriting pipelines: Automated systems that generate blog posts,\n newsletters, ad copy, and landing page content using AI, with human review checkpoints built into the workflow.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou should be familiar with tools like Buffer, Hootsuite, or Later for scheduling, and AI video tools like HeyGen, Pictory, or Opus Clip for automated video creation. If you have experience with Canva API or similar design automation, even better.\n\r\n\n\r\nClient-Facing Automation Solutions (20% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is where it gets interesting. We sell automation services to our clients — law firms, insurance agencies, financial advisors, and other businesses. You will build custom automation solutions that we deliver as a product. Examples:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nA law firm that manually tracks case deadlines ? you build an automated system that pulls court dates, sends reminders to attorneys, and escalates overdue items.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nAn insurance agency that manually sends renewal reminders ? you build an automated pipeline that identifies upcoming renewals, generates personalized outreach, and tracks responses.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nA financial advisor that manually creates quarterly reports ? you build a system that pulls portfolio data, generates AI-written commentary, and produces branded PDF reports automatically.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nA property management company that manually coordinates maintenance requests ? you build a system that receives requests, categorizes urgency with AI, dispatches vendors, and sends status updates to tenants.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe point is: you will constantly be solving new problems for new types of businesses. You need to be the kind of person who gets excited when someone describes a manual process, because you already see how to automate it.\n\r\n\n\r\nProactive Problem-Solving & Innovation (10% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is the most important part of the job description. We want you to constantly ask us what we are doing manually and tell us how to automate it. If you see us doing something by hand, we expect you to come to us and say \"I can build something that does that in 10 seconds.\" We want you to be so good at this that we start to wonder what we even do all day because you have automated everything.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will also stay current on new AI tools, automation platforms, and integration possibilities. When a new tool launches that could save us time or money, you bring it to us. When a client mentions a pain point in a call, you are already thinking about the workflow that solves it.\n\r\n\n\r\nDocumentation & Maintenance (5% of your time — but always on)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will document every automation you build — what it does, how it works, what triggers it, and how to troubleshoot it. When something breaks, you fix it fast. You will also build monitoring systems that alert you before things break.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Experience & Skills\n\r\n\n\r\nAdvanced automation platform experience is non-negotiable. You must have proven experience building complex, multi-step automations using at least two of the following: Make (Integromat), n8n, Zapier, or custom Python/Node.js scripts with API integrations. \"Complex\" means 10+ steps, multiple conditional branches, error handling, and integrations with 3+ different platforms in a single workflow. You should be able to show examples.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be an API expert. Reading documentation, authenticating (OAuth, API keys, Bearer tokens), making requests, parsing JSON responses, handling pagination, managing rate limits, and building retry logic. If a tool has an API, you should be able to connect it to anything else within hours, not days.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have deep experience with AI/LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, or similar). This goes beyond basic prompting. You should understand structured output formats (JSON mode), function calling, prompt chaining, context window management, and how to build quality control layers that catch bad AI output before it reaches a customer. You will use AI as a core component in almost every automation you build.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have experience with AI-powered content and video generation tools. This includes platforms like HeyGen, Synthesia, Pictory, Opus Clip, or similar for automated video creation, and experience integrating these tools into larger automated workflows via their APIs.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be proficient with Google Workspace automation — Google Sheets, Google Apps Script, Google Drive API, and Gmail API. A huge amount of our work flows through Google products, and you need to be able to build sophisticated automations within that ecosystem.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must think like a consultant, not just a technician. When someone describes a business problem, you should immediately start mapping out the automation architecture in your head. You do not wait to be told what to build — you identify opportunities and propose solutions.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong English communication is required. You will be on calls with clients explaining what you built and why. You need to be able to translate technical automation concepts into simple business language.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPreferred (Bonus) Skills\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with cold\n platforms (Smartlead, Instantly) and their APIs. Experience with CRM platforms (HubSpot, GoHighLevel, Salesforce) and their automation capabilities. Experience with webhook-based event processing and real-time data pipelines. Familiarity with cloud functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) or similar serverless environments. Experience building Slack/\n bots or notification systems. Experience with web scraping (Apify, Puppeteer, BeautifulSoup). Experience with database design and management (Airtable, Supabase, Firebase, or SQL). Experience building client-facing dashboards or reporting tools. Knowledge of social media APIs (Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok, X).\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application, answer these five questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.\n\r\nDescribe the most complex automation system you have ever built. What business problem did it solve, what tools did it connect, how many steps were involved, and what was the measurable impact (time saved, revenue generated, errors eliminated)?\n\r\n\n\r\n2.\n\r\nA law firm tells you they spend 5 hours per week manually sending follow-up\ns to leads who filled out a contact form on their website. Walk me through exactly how you would automate this end-to-end, including which tools you would use and why.\n\r\n\n\r\n3.\n\r\nHave you built any automated content creation or video generation systems? If yes, describe what you built, what AI tools you used, and how the content was distributed. If no, describe how you would approach building an automated system that takes one 30-minute podcast episode and turns it into 15 social media posts across 4 platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\n4.\n\r\nShow me a Loom video (preferred) or detailed screenshot walkthrough of an automation you built that is currently running in production. Walk me through the logic, the tools, and how you handle errors.\n\r\n\n\r\n5.\n\r\nWhat is the most creative automation you have ever built or seen? Something that made you think \"that is genius.\" Describe it and explain why it impressed you.\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a generic cover letter. Applications that do not answer all five questions will not be reviewed.                ",

Trusted Partner.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run multiple companies in the legal and financial services space. The mission is simple, help business owners succeed and build companies they can actually sell. The founder is a lawyer and finance guy by training, but you would never guess it. He is approachable, down to earth, and focused on results without the fluff, fake polish, or corporate nonsense.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is about being his right hand. You will protect his time, keep priorities straight, and make sure nothing important is forgotten. You will handle the calendar and inbox, but even more critical, you will manage follow-ups with referral partners, prospective customers, and key relationships so \nntum never dies.\n\r\n\n\r\nA normal day means filtering the inbox and calendar so the noise disappears and the right meetings get scheduled. You will sit in on calls or catch the notes, then turn them into clear follow-ups that live in the CRM and stay alive until complete. You will act as the founder’s second brain when it comes to high-value referral partners, prospects, and customers. You will nudge, remind, and track so relationships don’t fade and opportunities don’t slip. Communication will flow through Slack, where you will capture ideas, tasks, and follow-ups before they vanish.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will keep a close eye on the sales pipeline. We already have systems for the routine stuff, but your focus will be on the high-value opportunities where personal attention is everything. Ahead of meetings, you will pull quick research on people and companies so the founder shows up sharp. You will also work with tea\nmbers, contractors, and vendors to keep important projects moving forward.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is for someone who is proactive, structured, and relentless about follow-through. You thrive in a support role where success means the CEO never has to wonder whether something got done. You are comfortable with modern tools like Google Workspace, Slack, and CRMs, but you do not need to be a tech wizard.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not for someone who waits for instructions or hesitates to speak up. It is not for someone who only wants to be told what to do instead of acting as a true partner.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a full-time remote role. Ideal candidates are based in the Philippines with overlap in Mountain Time. Pay is based on experience, with bonus potential tied to performance. The founder is a foodie and loves cooking meals from scratch, so when you respond, tell us your favorite thing to eat. If you don’t answer that, you will not be considered. You will work directly with the founder as his right hand, making sure that every commitment, relationship, and opportunity gets the follow-through it deserves.                ",

    "description": "\n                    About Us\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a fast-growing B2B lead generation agency that helps professional service firms (insurance agencies, law firms, IT companies, financial advisors, and property maintenance companies) fill their pipeline with qualified prospects. We send high-volume, hyper-personalized cold\n campaigns across multiple industries and we need someone who can own the entire\n operation from list building to lead delivery.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a \"send 500\ns a week\" role. We operate at scale — tens of thousands of\ns per day across hundreds of inboxes. If you have never managed infrastructure at this level, this role is not for you. If you have, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Do Every Day\n\r\n\n\r\nCampaign Operations (60% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will manage the end-to-end cold\n process for multiple clients across different industries. This includes building targeted lead lists using B2B data platforms, writing and loading\n sequences into the sending platform, scheduling campaigns across rotating inboxes, and monitoring deliverability metrics (open rates, bounce rates, spam complaints) daily. You will manage 100+ sending inboxes and ensure every one stays healthy.\n\r\n\n\r\nDeliverability Management (20% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will own inbox warming, domain health, and sender reputation across all accounts. This means monitoring inbox placement rates, rotating underperforming domains, managing DNS authentication records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), and proactively pausing or replacing inboxes before they damage the overall sending reputation. You will run deliverability tests weekly and report results.\n\r\n\n\r\nLead Processing & Delivery (10% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen prospects reply, you will categorize responses (interested, maybe later, not interested, out of office, wrong person) and deliver qualified warm leads to clients via Google Sheets or CRM. Speed matters — warm leads must be delivered within 2 hours of reply during business hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nReporting & Optimization (10% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will maintain a weekly performance dashboard for each client showing\ns sent, open rates, reply rates, positive reply rates, and meetings booked. You will run A/B tests on subject lines, opening lines, and CTAs, and make data-driven recommendations to improve performance.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Experience & Skills\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have hands-on experience with at least two of the following cold\n sending platforms: Smartlead, Instantly, Lemlist, Woodpecker, or Mailshake. You should be comfortable managing campaigns with 50+ active sending accounts simultaneously.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must understand\n deliverability at a technical level — not just \"warm up your inbox\" but the actual mechanics of SPF/DKIM/DMARC configuration, inbox rotation strategies, and how to diagnose and fix deliverability drops.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have experience with B2B lead data platforms for building targeted prospect lists. You should know how to filter by industry, company size, job title, geography, and other criteria to build high-quality lists that match a client's ideal customer profile.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be proficient in Google Sheets (pivot tables, VLOOKUP, data cleanup formulas) since this is how we track leads and report to clients.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong written English is required. You will be writing and editing\n copy that goes to American business owners — it must sound natural, not templated.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPreferred (Bonus) Skills\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with Clay or similar data enrichment tools for adding personalization layers to lead lists. Experience using AI (ChatGPT, Claude) to generate personalized\n icebreakers at scale. Familiarity with Google Workspace admin for managing multiple inboxes. Experience with Zapier, Make, or n8n for workflow automation between platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application, answer these four questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.\n\r\nWhat is the largest number of sending inboxes you have managed at one time, and what sending platform were you using?\n\r\n\n\r\n2.\n\r\nDescribe a time when your\n deliverability dropped significantly. What caused it and how did you fix it?\n\r\n\n\r\n3.\n\r\nWhat is your process for building a lead list of 10,000 business owners in a specific industry and geography?\n\r\n\n\r\n4.\n\r\nShow me an example of a hyper-personalized cold\n you wrote (or generated with AI). What data points did you use to personalize it, and where did you get that data? If you cannot share a real example, write one right now for a fictional insurance agency owner named Mike Thompson who runs a 12-person agency in Dallas, TX.\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a generic cover letter. Applications that do not answer these four questions will not be reviewed.                ",
