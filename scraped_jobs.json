Bare started out as a direct-to-consumer funeral home offering a digitally enabled, low-cost funeral service. We've since expanded to become Australia's leading provider of prepaid funerals, online wills, online estate planning, and pet funerals. Our vision is to become the end-of-life CRM, supporting individuals and families to deal with a difficult topic in an empathic, affordable, and sustainable way.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe exciting part? The journey has only just started. We are backed by some of Australia's highest profile investors, are currently one of the fastest growing companies in Australia, and we're committed to making a difference. Join us on the ground and be intimately involved in the creation and development of a product and service that is category-leading.\n\r\nThe Role:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re looking for a Training, Learning & Automation Specialist to design, build and scale our internal learning ecosystem while embedding automation and AI-driven efficiency across training, onboarding and operational workflows.\n\r\nThis is not a traditional L&D role.

    "description": "\n                    Overview\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not looking for a traditional graphic designer.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who understands how to build visual systems at scale using AI tools and can turn large volumes of AI-generated assets into cohesive, high-performing products and brand visuals.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role sits between design, AI workflows, and production execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will not be creating everything manually. You will be directing, refining, and systemizing AI-generated outputs so they look professional, consistent, and commercially effective.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a probationary role initially. We are looking for proven capability, not theory.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Actually Do\n\r\n\n\r\n• Own visual consistency across products, marketing, and digital assets.\n\r\n• Build reusable visual styles and frameworks that teams can follow.\n\r\n• Improve AI-generated outputs through design judgment, prompting refinement, and layout decisions.\n\r\n• Work with AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney/SDXL/ComfyUI-style workflows, etc.).\n\r\n• Guide teams on composition, brand alignment, and visual hierarchy.\n\r\n• Convert raw AI outputs into polished, conversion-ready assets.\n\r\n• Help scale production without sacrificing quality.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Is NOT\n\r\n\n\r\n• Not a junior designer role.\n\r\n• Not someone making random Canva graphics.\n\r\n• Not someone who only knows traditional design software without AI workflow experience.\n\r\n• Not someone who needs heavy direction.\n\r\n\n\r\nIdeal Candidate Profile\n\r\n\n\r\n• Strong visual taste and commercial design judgment.\n\r\n• Experience working with AI-generated assets.\n\r\n• Understands how to reduce visual drift and maintain consistency at scale.\n\r\n• Can think in systems, not just single images.\n\r\n• Comfortable working in fast, high-output environments.\n\r\n• Bonus: motion/animation experience for short-form content.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow Success Will Be Measured\n\r\n\n\r\n• Visual consistency improves across products and platforms.\n\r\n• AI outputs require less rework.\n\r\n• Product designs feel cohesive and brand-aligned.\n\r\n• Teams move faster because design direction is clear.\n\r\n\n\r\nScreening Questions (Required — No Exceptions)\n\r\n\n\r\n1. What visual or production problem did you encounter in a real project?\n\r\nExplain the problem clearly.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. What did you personally do to fix it?\n\r\nDescribe your process, decisions, and tools used (especially AI tools if applicable).\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Show the result.\n\r\nProvide before/after examples or links and explain how your work improved outcomes (quality, consistency, speed, or performance).\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for builders and problem-solvers, not portfolio-only designers.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you cannot clearly explain your thinking process and show measurable improvement from your work, this role is not a fit.

This is the work I have guaranteed right now, but as I book more sessions and weddings, they will be added onto a task board right away so that you can see well in advance what I'll need help with and when it would be due, which will give you plenty of time to plan your life and other editing jobs accordingly around that.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs a heads up, I use an Ai editing tool to help me with the base edit so that the editing process is as efficient as possible. This means you would receive a Lightroom catalog with the images partially or mostly edited, but I still need help getting them fully completed through cropping, straightening, brush work, spot removal / eliminating distractions exposure + temperature correction, etc. and ensuring the images match my signature style.\n\r\n\n\r\nSince the Ai editing tool will be taking care of the base edit, this means that it will take you less time per image to finish the edit to the standard I'm looking for since there will already be a base edit applied. For this reason, I'm looking for someone who can fine tune these images for $0.12 CAD per image. There will also be Photoshop retouching needed on a case by case basis, which includes advanced object removal and head swaps (only on selected images) and comes at an additional pay at $0.12 CAD per image.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere is what I need help with:\n\r\n\n\r\n-Fine tuning/editing about\n+ photos per wedding in Lightroom using a preset I work with\n\r\n-Fine tuning/editing about 15-50+photos per session Lightroom using a preset I work with\n\r\n-Using brush tool, graduated filters, cropping, straightening, and making sure the Al tool got the correct exposure and colour temperature (you will be trained on how I edit my photos)\n\r\n- Object removal and head swaps using Photoshop on a case by case basis \n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I am NOT looking for:\n\r\n\n\r\n*If you are disorganized or have difficulty with deadlines and structure, please do not apply. \n\r\n*If you can't take honest feedback well and can learn quickly from the feedback, please do not apply.\n\r\n* If you have an unreliable internet connection, please do not apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\r\n* Seeking a long-term, part-time seasonal role, with primary work between May - November. \n\r\n*Dedicated, Loyal, On-Time, Organized, Hits Deadlines, Detail Oriented, Creative, Quick Learner, strong in English\n\r\n*Strong attention to detail and the ability to follow creative direction.\n\r\n*Experienced in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop.\n\r\n*Someone who takes responsibility for the work they do and doesn't make excuses \n\r\n*Someone who prides themselves on being detail-oriented and creating consistent high quality results\n\r\n*Someone who is EXCITED to edit wedding and couples photos full of emotion and beauty \n\r\n*Ideally someone who could support me with having a 5-7 day turnaround time for weddings and a 2-3 business day turnaround time for sessions.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this sounds like you and you'd love to connect more about this opportunity, reply to this job post with the following: your WhatsApp number, your\n, let me know if you have Photoshop / Lightroom, let me know if you have a strong internet connection, why you love editing photos for other photographers, if $0.12 CAD per image works for you, examples of edited work you enjoyed editing, and an inspirational quote that makes you happy,\n\r\n\n\r\nAs a heads up, I will only be responding to applicants that I will select for the interview process, so if you don't hear back fro\n by March 3rd, I've d\n to go in a different direction.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Kayla                ",

    "description": "\n                    You don't want just any job. You want work that actually uses your brain.\n\r\nYou're the person who notices the gap before anyone else does. Who finishes a task and quietly thinks about how the process could have been smoother. Who finds a system that works — and then makes it better.\n\r\nIf that sounds familiar, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us\n\r\nPrivate Practice Alliance is an online business management firm that supports practitioners — particularly allied health professionals — to build sustainable, well-structured businesses.\n\r\nWe believe that good systems create relief. That clear structures reduce overwhelm. And that the administrative and operational foundations of a business are what allow practitioners to stay in work they love, for the long term.\n\r\nWe're growing, and we're looking for someone who wants to grow with us.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nThis is a full-time assistant role reporting directly to the founder. You'll be working across the business — supporting operations, keeping projects moving, maintaining quality and consistency, and making sure the right things happen in the right order.\n\r\nThis isn't a passive role. You'll be expected to take ownership, anticipate needs, and flag problems before they become crises. You'll also work across platforms and tools — so comfort with technology isn't optional.\n\r\nSome of what you'll be doing:\n\r\n– Managing inboxes, scheduling, and day-to-day operations so the founder can stay in her zone of genius\n\r\n– Keeping projects on track — deadlines met, nothing falling through the gaps\n\r\n– Supporting content, marketing, and client-facing work with attention to brand quality\n\r\n– Learning our systems, following our processes, and flagging when something isn't working\n\r\n– Communicating clearly and professionally with tea\nmbers and clients\n\r\n– Picking up new tools and platforms quickly — and using them well\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We're Looking For\n\r\nYou don't need to have worked in private practice before. But you do need to understand how administration, client journeys, and brand consistency work — and why they matter.\n\r\nYou're the right fit if you:\n\r\n– Think in systems and processes, not just tasks\n\r\n– Catch details others miss — and care that you do\n\r\n– Communicate with clarity and professionalism\n\r\n– Can manage competing priorities without dropping the ball\n\r\n– Take feedback constructively and implement it quickly\n\r\n– Are genuinely comfortable with technology and enjoy figuring out new tools\n\r\n– Know how to hold a boundary, follow a process, and ask a good question\n\r\n– Are calm under pressure — not because nothing bothers you, but because you've got structure\n\r\nYou're probably not the right fit if you need a lot of hand-holding, struggle with ambiguity, or are looking for a role where the expectations are low.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Get\n\r\n– Full-time hours in a role that's genuinely interesting\n\r\n– Work that contributes to something meaningful — better businesses create better lives for practitioners and their clients\n\r\n– A founder who is direct, fair, and invested in your growth\n\r\n– Real responsibility from day one — not busywork\n\r\n– Exposure to the full picture of how an online business is run\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nIf this sounds like you, we'd like to hear from you. Please respond to \n 25 March 26 with the following details:\n\r\n\n\r\nStep #1: Record a video answering the question:\n\r\n\"If you were to jump/fall safely from a cliff, would you:\n\r\na) Fall with your back to the ground\n\r\nb) Fall with your face to the ground\n\r\nc) Dive in\n\r\nd) Jump feet first\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd why did you choose that answer?\"\n\r\n\n\r\nStep #2:\n it with the subject line: \"I want to be a Virtual Admin.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nWe review applications as they come in and will be in touch if we'd like to move forward.

    "description": "\n                    Hello! I've just made a profile based off my friends recommendation to use this website. \n\r\n\n\r\nI have looked, looked and looked some more for a video editor for my project but have found it very hard. I have so much footage and it is a long video, many video editors didn't understand what I wanted. \n\r\n\n\r\nHere is the brief (it is obvious that I used chatgpt for this brief because every other brief I wrote myself, nobody seemed to understand the vibe or atmosphere of a video I wanted to create):\n\r\n\n\r\nObjective:\n\r\nCreate a polished travel vlog from my footage in Seoul that feels cinematic, immersive, and story-driven, similar in vibe to the reference video I shared (YouTube link at the bottom). I want the viewer to feel like they’re experiencing Seoul with me, rather than just watching random clips.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Overall Style & Tone\n\r\n• Vibe: Authentic, warm, cinematic travel storytelling — a mix of visual montage and voiceover narration that feels reflective and personal.\n\r\n• Editing Style: Smooth pacing — not too fast like a flashy/viral style, but engaging enough to keep interest (think visual rhythm matched to music, subtle mood changes throughout the video).\n\r\n• Color Grading: Natural with slight warmth — enhance city lights, food scenes, nightlife, and candid \nnts without overly heavy filters.\n\r\n• Transitions: Clean cuts, some soft dissolves or film-like transitions where appropriate for mood shifts.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Narrative Structure\n\r\n1. Intro (0:00–0:15)\n\r\n• Establishing shots of Seoul — city skyline, streets, markets, your arrival, etc.\n\r\n• Overlay a short intro voiceover (e.g., “I lived in Seoul for three years and love the people here etc;/I’m here for my friend’s wedding…”) — set the tone for the story.\n\r\n2. Story Progression\n\r\nI want the video to feel like a journey with emotional beats:\n\r\nSection Visuals Voiceover\n\r\nSeeing friends Footage of meetups, greetings, city walks Reflective, personal memories\n\r\nEating & food scenes Shots of plates, eating, street food Voiceover about favourite meals\n\r\nPartying / nightlife Club clips, street scenes Personal commentary about experiences\n\r\nDaily life & exploration Temples, markets, streets, trains Relating thoughts and mood\n\r\n• Only use my speaking footage as voiceover commentary, never as full on-camera talking segments.\n\r\n• Align visuals to the rhythm and emotion of the voiceover — emotional, real, conversational.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Audio & Music\n\r\n• Music: Ambient, chill beats that enhance atmosphere but don’t overpower voiceover.\n\r\n• Voiceover: Clear, balanced — place emphasis transitions between scenes.\n\r\n• Sound Design: Include ambient sounds when useful (street noise, laughter, music in the background) but keep clarity of the voiceover.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Pacing & Feel\n\r\n• Have visual pacing match the emotion of each section — slower and immersive during reflective parts, slightly more kinetic during fun outings.\n\r\n• Avoid hyper–fast jump cuts. Let \nnts breathe.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Reference Inspiration\n\r\nHere’s the link to a video with the vibe I love:\n\r\n???? YouTube Reference: \n\r\n(The storytelling cadence, emotional pacing, and seamless integration of voiceover with visuals is the style I want to emulate.)\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're interested I can tell you more over a Zoom chat.

    "description": "\n                    Innovative global coffee brand inventing one-of-a-kind tools redefining how coffee is experienced. Seeking a Marketing Manager to own campaigns, launches, and cross-channel execution alongside founders.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT ICOSA BREWHOUSE:\n\r\nICOSA Brewhouse is a globally recognized specialty coffee brand redefining how coffee is experienced. We are shaping coffee culture around the world. (\n  / \n )\n\r\n\n\r\nWe design and invent one-of-a-kind tools that didn’t exist before — tools that elevate everyday rituals and introduce new ways of enjoying coffee.\n\r\n\n\r\nFrom record-breaking Kickstarter launches to collaborations with world-class coffee professionals, our products are used by champions, in top cafés, and in homes in 100+ countries around the world. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a design-led, innovation-driven brand operating in a niche we are actively shaping. We build thoughtfully, test deliberately, and care deeply about quality — in both product and execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs we continue to innovate, launch new products, and grow, we are looking for a Senior Social Media & Marketing Manager to take ownership of how our work is brought to life across channels.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou won’t just publish content.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll help shape how new products are introduced, how campaigns are structured, and how our global community experiences our brand — while ensuring execution remains disciplined, consistent, and scalable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR ROLE AND OPPORTUNITY ON THE TEAM:\n\r\nThis is a senior marketing operator role. Execution is central — but it is not a junior content posting role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work directly with our Marketing Lead to:\n\r\n• Own day-to-day marketing delivery across core channels\n\r\n• Structure and execute campaigns from planning through rollout\n\r\n• Translate ideas into clear, executable briefs\n\r\n• Coordinate creative production across internal, outsourced, and AI-assisted workflows\n\r\n• Strengthen how our marketing engine operates over time\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will see early product prototypes.\n\r\nYou will contribute to campaign discussions before launch.\n\r\nYou will help shape how innovation is presented to a global audience.\n\r\n\n\r\nExecution is central to this role — but so is judgment, ownership, and the ability to think in campaigns rather than isolated posts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll own:\n\r\n\n\r\n(1) Marketing Execution Across Channels\n\r\n• Own social media execution (Instagram and\n).\n\r\n• Plan and manage content calendars aligned with brand positioning.\n\r\n• Ensure consistent publishing and follow-through across platforms.\n\r\n• Manage inbox and community engagement, including partnership or influencer communication if required.\n\r\n• Execute\n campaigns aligned with launches, promotions, and collaborations.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou ensure marketing execution remains structured, timely, and dependable.\n\r\n\n\r\n(2) Campaign Rollout & Launch Execution\n\r\n• Support and execute seasonal campaigns, product launches, collaborations, and promotional initiatives.\n\r\n• Translate marketing objectives into structured creative briefs.\n\r\n• Coordinate creative asset development across designers, freelancers, and AI-supported workflows.\n\r\n• Oversee cohesive cross-channel rollout so messaging, visuals, and timing align across social,\n, and paid efforts.\n\r\n• Strengthen campaign structure and rollout processes over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou think in campaigns — not just content pieces.\n\r\n\n\r\n(3) Creative Briefing & Quality Control\n\r\n• Create clear, structured briefs for design and content production.\n\r\n• Maintain high standards of aesthetic consistency, messaging clarity, and brand voice integrity across both human and AI-assisted workflows.\n\r\n• Draft copy or guide AI-assisted content creation when needed, ensuring outputs remain on-brand and high quality.\n\r\n• Review creative outputs for brand alignment before escalation to the Marketing Lead.\n\r\n• Collaborate comfortably in tools such as Figma or similar platforms to support execution and alignment.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou don’t need to be a designer — but you should have strong creative judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\n(4) Growth & Operational Development\n\r\n• Identify opportunities to refine workflows and strengthen how our marketing engine operates.\n\r\n• Lead or contribute to structured testing and rollout of new channels or initiatives as capacity allows.\n\r\n• Over time, take increasing ownership of campaign structuring, cross-channel coordination, partnership campaign oversight, and creative alignment across performance-driven efforts.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs you demonstrate reliability and judgment, your scope expands meaningfully.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat success looks like:\n\r\n• Social and\n channels operate smoothly with consistent execution and strong brand alignment.\n\r\n• Campaigns are rolled out in a coordinated, cross-channel manner without last-minute chaos.\n\r\n• Creative briefs are structured, clear, and reduce friction across collaborators.\n\r\n• Marketing execution no longer bottlenecks leadership attention.\n\r\n• Early experiments in new channels or initiatives are tested in a structured way.\n\r\n\n\r\nOver time, you become a trusted execution leader within the marketing team.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Is Not:\n\r\n• Not a pure content creator role.\n\r\n• Not a brand strategist role.\n\r\n• Not a paid media buyer role.\n\r\n• Not an administrative coordinator role.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a senior marketing operator position inside a growing global brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT YOU / WHO WE’RE LOOKING FOR:\n\r\nYou are someone who:\n\r\n• Understands how structured marketing campaigns come together.\n\r\n• Can translate ideas into clear execution plans.\n\r\n• Is comfortable owning delivery without hand-holding.\n\r\n• Is comfortable reviewing performance data and using insights to inform execution decisions.\n\r\n• Is strategic enough to think ahead — but practical enough to execute consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are strategic enough to think ahead — but practical enough to execute consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have skills or experience:\n\r\n• 4–6+ years of experience managing marketing and/or social for a brand.\n\r\n• Experience executing structured marketing campaigns.\n\r\n• Experience within D2C or product-based brands strongly preferred.\n\r\n• Comfortable operating inside e-commerce environments.\n\r\n• Highly detail-oriented and disciplined in follow-through.\n\r\n• Strong creative judgment and ability to assess content quality and brand alignment.\n\r\n• Comfort collaborating in design tools such as Figma.\n\r\n• Comfortable working directly with founders in a small, fast-moving team.\n\r\n\n\r\nBig pluses:\n\r\n• Experience supporting product launches or crowdfunding campaigns.\n\r\n• Experience creating, implementing, and refining marketing processes or building SOPs.\n\r\n• Experience coordinating freelancers or creative collaborators.\n\r\n• Familiarity with Klaviyo or similar\n platforms.\n\r\n• Exposure to AI-assisted marketing workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY JOIN US:\n\r\nAt ICOSA Brewhouse, you will:\n\r\n• Work directly with founders who are deeply involved in product design, positioning, and global campaigns.\n\r\n• Operate close to innovation — seeing products and launches before they are introduced to the world.\n\r\n• Contribute to campaigns that reach a global coffee audience.\n\r\n• Have real ownership inside a small, high-performing team where your work is visible and impactful.\n\r\n• Help shape coffee culture around the world.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a fully remote team — but we operate with structure and discipline.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be joining a close-knit group focused on building something meaningful with collaboration and accountability. There is no office politics. No unnecessary hierarchy. Just people committed to high standards.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe care deeply about growth — not just as a company, but as individuals. As we expand, there are real opportunities to take on broader ownership, lead initiatives, and shape how our marketing evolves.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want a role where:\n\r\n• Your ideas are heard.\n\r\n• Your execution matters.\n\r\n• Your scope can grow with your capability.\n\r\nYou will feel at home here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION AND WORKING STRUCTURE\n\r\nFull time: 40 hours/week \n\r\nCompensation range: $1,100-$1,800 (based on relevant experience and demonstrated capability)\n\r\nUp to 16 days of paid time off annually\n\r\nAsia time zone working hours required\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nAre you ready? \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’d like to join us on our journey and grow together with us, we’re looking forward to meeting you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe understand you may have a busy schedule, so we’ve made our application process extremely efficient. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please follow the steps below:\n\r\n1.
