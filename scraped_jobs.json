    "description": "\n                    Do not apply if you are new to GoHighLevel. I am looking for advanced experts.\n\r\n\n\r\nI am launching a new SaaS Agency on the GoHighLevel platform. I am already proficient in GHL myself (I can build workflows, sites, and triggers), but I am looking for an Architect who is faster, smarter, and more technical than I am.\n\r\n\n\r\nI need a long-term Technical Partner. If you prove yourself on the initial build, I want you to manage the entire technical backend of the agency as we scale to $50k/mo. You will help build and refine the product. I am looking for a proactive individual who will take lead and come up with improvements without being instructed to do so. I want you to bring your expertise to help grow this business. \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Project (Immediate Scope)\n\r\nI have a detailed technical scope ready for you, but here is the summary:\n\r\n\n\r\n- You will be building the \"Factory,\" not just one product.\n\r\n- Build the funnels and site for our own agency\n\r\n- Agency Backend Compliance: You must handle the A2P 10DLC Registration, UK Regulatory Bundles (Twilio), and SaaS Rebilling setup. If you don't know what any of this means, do not apply.\n\r\n- Snapshot Architecture: You will build a \"Standard\" and \"Premium\" snapshot in a sandbox environment. You must understand how to use Custom Values for everything so deployment is instant.\n\r\n- The \"Hollywood\" Demo Account: You will build a demo environment populated with fake leads, fake conversations, and fake revenue data. I need to be able to log in and demo the software live without setting it up.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\nSpeed: I value results, not hours. If you can build this in just 2 days perfectly, I will pay you the full project fee.\n\r\n\n\r\nEnglish: Must be 100% fluent. You will be writing some of the\n copy in the workflows, and I will need your assistance with the first initial demos and sales calls\n\r\n\n\r\nTimezone: Flexible, but you must be willing to join a few sales calls during UK/Europe Afternoon hours just as we get started \n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation:\n\r\nProject Fee: Negotiable (High budget for the right expert).\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-Term: Opportunity for a monthly retainer + profit share on setup fees for the right partner.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE \"EXPERT\" TEST (REQUIRED)\n\r\nPlease answer answer these 4 technical scenarios in your application. If you skip these, I will delete your application.\n\r\n\n\r\nQ1. I plan to sell this snapshot to 100 plumbers. I do NOT want to manually edit 50\ns and SMS templates for every new client to change the \"Booking Link\" and \"Business Name.\". How do you structure the snapshot to ensure I only have to fill out one form during onboarding to update every workflow instantly?\n\r\n\n\r\nQ2. I have a workflow with a \"Wait 24 Hours Before Appointment\" reminder. If a lead books an appointment for today at 2:00 PM (only 3 hours from now), what happens when they hit that \"Wait 24 Hours Before\" step? How do you ensure they still get the \"1 Hour Before\" reminder without getting stuck?\n\r\n\n\r\nQ3.I want to run a Database Reactivation campaign on a list of 2,000 old leads. If I dump all 2,000 leads into the \"SMS Offer\" workflow at once, my Twilio number will get blocked for spam. How do you configure the workflow (or bulk action) to automatically drip feed these messages at a safe rate (e.g., 50 per day) without me doing it manually?\n\r\n\n\r\nQ4. Explain to me why building workflows directly inside the main Agency Sub-Account is a bad idea for future updates. How would you structure it instead?\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you for your time                ",

Here’s an example of various ad formats we use:\n\r\n\n \n\r\n\n\r\nWHO ARE WE?\n\r\nHello everyone, \n\r\nI’m the CEO & founder of a fast growing direct response E-commerce holding company, currently doing $1mm per month with our own in-house supplement brands that we started from scratch. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re looking to hire a Senior video editor who can bring our visions for creatives to life, specifically using realistic style AI to generate content using tools such as Sora 2, Veo 3, Kling, Higgsfield or others… an example of an ad generated with full Sora AI B-roll is this here: \n \n\r\n\n \n\r\nThe majority of the video is generated here with AI b-roll in order to bring the story to life. We will provide you with any tools you need but ideally we’d want someone very knowledgeable with AI and Sora video generation as that’s what seems to be performing the best. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe want someone who’ll be constantly curious on how to edit and increase their skills as a whole.

At the company we go by a motto of “sharpening your sword” with consistent work to become the best. \n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY? (via. onlinejobs)\n\r\nStep 1. Send me videos you’ve made in the past utilizing AI\n\r\nStep 2. Send me videos of clips/b-rolls you’ve generated using AI, for example: \n \n\r\nStep 3. Send me the hours & days you’re available for editing and if you have any other jobs you’re doing currently\n\r\n\n\r\nFINAL Step, If your resume seems good, we will ask for a PAID sample to confirm your skills. The payment for the sample will be added to your first paycheck (next Friday, then every 2 weeks). \n\r\n\n\r\nThank you for reading this application, I look forward to working with the best of the best!\n\r\nCheers                ",

In the supplement world, \"design equals trust\"—you will be responsible for maintaining that high standard across all platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\nMulti-Channel Management: Lead the narrative across TikTok, Instagram,\n, and LinkedIn, tailoring the tone for each (e.g., \"Hacks\" for TikTok vs. \"Industry Authority\" for LinkedIn).\n\r\n\n\r\n### The \"Non-Negotiables\"\n\r\nThe \"Value-First\" Mindset: You know that a video explaining why a specific ingredient works is often more effective for organic growth than a \"10% off\" graphic.\n\r\n\n\r\nDirect Response Foundations: Even though you are creating \"content,\" you understand the principles of direct response—strong hooks, clear calls to value, and psychological triggers.\n\r\n\n\r\nTechnical Proficiency: Advanced skills in Canva and a suite of AI productivity tools. You should be comfortable using AI to multiply your output, not replace your creativity.\n\r\n\n\r\nHealth/Supplement Interest: An interest in the health and wellness space is vital. You should be able to speak the language of \"recovery,\" \"biohacking,\" and \"wellness\" authentically.\n\r\n\n\r\nE-commerce Savvy: Experience with Shopify and an understanding of how social content feeds into a larger e-commerce ecosystem.\n\r\n\n\r\n### Why This Role?\n\r\nYou will be at the heart of our brand-building engine. You’ll have the opportunity to work on the \"front lines\" of our consumer-facing supplement brands and the \"behind-the-scenes\" of our manufacturing arms. We are a results-oriented team that values speed, clear communication, and the ability to distinguish \"noise\" from \"signal.\"                ",

Add Visual Interest\n\r\nThis is what separates good YouTube editing from basic cutting.\n\r\nYou'll:\n\r\n> Integrate B-roll that supports what's being said (not random filler)\n\r\n> Add text overlays for key points and emphasis\n\r\n> Include screenshots, graphics, or reference images\n\r\n> Source additional B-roll from stock sites when needed (accounts provided)\n\r\n> Create visual variety so it's not just a talking head\n\r\n> Use graphics and text to reinforce important information\n\r\n> Ensure every visual serves a purpose\n\r\nThink of B-roll as visual punctuation; it emphasizes, clarifies, and keeps viewers engaged.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Polish Audio & Add Music \n\r\nYou'll:\n\r\n> Clean up audio inconsistencies\n\r\n> Remove background noise\n\r\n> Balance audio levels between sections\n\r\n> Add background music appropriately (not constantly, not overwhelming)\n\r\n> Ensure sponsor segments are clean and professional\n\r\n>Check for audio sync issues\n\r\n> Make sure nothing is jarring or distracting\n\r\n\n\r\n5.

version\n\r\n> Make any final tweaks\n\r\n> Export and deliver final version\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're Perfect for This If You:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand YouTube editing specifically\n\r\n> You know YouTube

You can watch raw footage and see the story hiding inside\n\r\n> You know what to keep and what to cut\n\r\n> You make content more engaging without changing the message\n\r\n> You don't over-edit or

But if you get satisfaction from crafting content that works, engages, and serves its purpose — this could be perfect.\n\r\n\n\r\nReady to apply? Send your complete application to: \n \n\r\n\n\r\nWe're reviewing applications on a rolling basis and will respond to qualified candidates within 5 business days.\n\r\n\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing your work.

And do you have experience helping online creators with courses and funnels?\n\r\n\n\r\n\n (BHWA) is a well-established aging health and caregiving education website created by me, Dr. Leslie Kernisan, MD. I’m a geriatrician and blogger growing an online membership for people helping aging parents. I also have two YouTube channels and a podcast.\n\r\n\n\r\nI’m now hiring for a smart and very detail-oriented executive virtual assistant who will be helping me execute, document, coordinate, and problem-solve in all areas of my business.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe role will start at about 20 hours per week, with potential to grow in hours (and in hourly rate!), if you are able to do the job well and take more off my plate. When you get the work done is flexible, but you’ll need to do at least a few hours every weekday.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease note that I have been running BHWA for 10+ years, I’ve had the same Ph-based VA doing routine tasks and customer service since 2020, and I do have ongoing freelancers to help with things like video editing and complex automations. Although I am always learning and growing, at this point I know my business very well, and I know what works well for me when it comes to VAs.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is NOT for someone who just wants to be handed tasks to do. For this executive VA role, I need to find someone very much like me: smart, organized, proactive, and EXTREMELY detail-oriented. Someone who will double-check that things are done correctly (e.g. the links in an\n broadcast), so that I don’t have to. Someone who can figure out why something isn’t working and fix it, so that I don’t have to.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will also need to be willing and able to document everything you do as you go along; I have found this is critical to running the business long-term. (So if you are the type who likes to go fixing problems but skips documenting what you changed and why, you are not a good fit.)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have previous experience with Clickup and Wordpress. Experience with ActiveCampaign, Kajabi, and YouTube is strongly preferred.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will need to be excellent at following instructions and also resourceful enough to figure things out and solve problems when necessary. During your training phase, you will need to be checking with me often; once we have gotten to know each other and you’ve demonstrated that you can do the work according to my standards, I will be happy to give you more autonomy.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis will be a great steady job for the right person! If you think you are a good fit, please apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nJOB TITLE\n\r\nVirtual Executive Assistant\n\r\nExecutive Assistant & Operations Assistant\n\r\n\n\r\nJOB DETAILS\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n- $8-10/hour (negotiable depending on skills and experience), with the possibility of raising the rate once you have learned the business and are freeing up my time\n\r\n- Paid every two weeks (or monthly) via Wise\n\r\n\n\r\nWork hours:\n\r\n- 3-4 hours every week day, up to 20 hours/week as a start.

Duties may include (but are not limited to):\n\r\n- Attend, participate and take notes for weekly planning meetings\n\r\n- Assist Dr. K with documentation of her work and with execution of her various tasks\n\r\n- Project coordination using Clickup; monitor and communicate project status, ensure that it’s updated and next steps are clear for everyone\n\r\n- Compile and present status reports\n\r\n- Monitoring and reporting on key performance indicators\n\r\n- Contribute to improving our process for handling member registrations, cancellations, and other customer support issues\n\r\n- Assisting with the creation and organization of registration pages and other logistics, when we run our membership enrollment drives\n\r\n- Assisting with the Company’s website and related\n subscriber list\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nTo apply, you must do the following things:\n\r\n- Make sure your profile in Onlinejobs.ph includes IQ and DISC assessment\n\r\n- Include the words AGING IS IMPORTANT in the subject line of your message to me\n\r\n- Send me a cover letter explaining why this position appeals to you and why you think you are an excellent fit\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly candidates who complete all the above will receive responses.

    "description": "\n                    We're looking for a sharp, reliable Virtual Personal Assistant to help a busy entrepreneur stay fully organized across personal life - health and fitness tracking, travel planning, reservations, errands, research, and daily logistics. You need to be fast, responsive, and always a step ahead. Strong research skills, attention to detail, and high integrity are non-negotiable.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't a gig - it's a long-term partnership. I invest in people who invest in me. That means competitive pay now, raises over time, and real stability. The right person will never have to worry about finding another job. You have my back, I have yours.\n\r\n\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\nWHAT DAY TO DAY LOOKS LIKE\n\r\n\n\r\n- I send you a photo of my lunch — you estimate macros and log it in my tracking sheet within minutes\n\r\n- I screenshot my body composition scan — you log every measurement and flag any trends\n\r\n- I tell you \"plan a weekend trip to Tulum for me and my girlfriend\" — you come back with flights, hotel, restaurant reservations, and a full itinerary without asking me 20 questions\n\r\n- Track all my subscriptions and flag me before anything renews so I can cancel what I don't need\n\r\n- Find me the best cold plunge under $5,000 — compare features, dimensions, cooling systems, warranties, and give me a top 3 with pros and cons\n\r\n- I want to start a new supplement stack for sleep optimization — research the science, find the best brands, figure out timing and dosages, and put it all in a clean doc I can follow\n\r\n- I mention I have a headache and haven't been sleeping well — you cross-reference my recent meals and macros to flag if something's off nutritionally before I even ask\n\r\n- I'm comparing two different health protocols I saw online — break down the science behind both, pros and cons, and tell me which one actually makes sense for my goals\n\r\n- I got bloodwork back — organize the results in a spreadsheet, flag anything out of range, and research what supplements or dietary changes could help\n\r\n- I'm training for a specific physical goal — research the best approach, recovery protocols, and adjust my nutrition tracking to match\n\r\n\n\r\nThere are plenty more tasks but hopefully that gives you a real picture of what this role looks like.\n\r\n\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\nWHAT I'M LOOKING FOR\n\r\n\n\r\n- Proven experience as a personal assistant — this is not an entry-level role\n\r\n- Fast communicator — responsive throughout 9am-9pm EST, 7 days a week\n\r\n- Proactive and independent — you figure things out and anticipate needs before being asked\n\r\n- Strong researcher — you dig deep, not just surface-level Googling\n\r\n- Organized and detail-oriented — nothing falls through the cracks\n\r\n- Comfortable using AI tools like Claude for research and efficiency (very important) - means your good at prompting\n\r\n- Interest in health and fitness — you'll be working with nutrition and body composition data daily\n\r\n- Honest and direct — if you make a mistake, tell me immediately. I'm understanding, I just need to know\n\r\n- Takes feedback well and always looking to improve\n\r\n- Trustworthy and discreet\n\r\n\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\nWHY YOU'D WANT THIS ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-term stability — I don't cycle through assistants. I'm looking for someone to grow with for years, not months\n\r\nI'm a kind, direct, and reasonable person to work for. I don't micromanage. I give you goals and trust you to figure out the how \n\r\n\n\r\nCompetitive pay with consistent raises as we build together — your growth is tied to mine\n\r\n\n\r\nVariety every single day — no two days look the same. You'll never be bored\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll be genuinely valued, not treated like a task robot. I take care of the people who take care of me\n\r\n\n\r\nActual work is roughly 3 hours a day — the rest of the time you're on-call but free. You're being paid for availability and reliability, not busywork\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll learn a ton — health optimization, travel planning, business operations.

I also have two big trips coming up (Dominican Republic next week  and France and Italy in March). I need someone who can take raw travel footage and make it scroll-stopping.\n\r\nProject 2: Wine Content - Wine education and wine travel content (combining sommelier-level expertise with travel).\n\r\nIf These Go Well (April Onward):\n\r\nAI Video Ad Training - You’d join me in learning an 8-week AI video ad creation program (valued at $5k, my discounted rate is $2k). We’d learn together how to create humor-leaning video ads for small businesses using cutting-edge AI tools.\n\r\nOnce you master this system, you’d be welcome to take on your own local clients using what you’ve learned. I’d focus on US clients (at higher rates), which means your pay would grow as we scale together.\n\r\nWhat I Need Right Now:\n\r\nSomeone who can look at raw footage and immediately see the story. I don’t want to have to explain every edit - I want someone who understands what makes people stop scrolling and can bring creative ideas to the table.\n\r\nSpecifically:\n\r\n ? Strong hooks (the first 3 seconds are everything)\n\r\n ? Good pacing and retention (keep people watching)\n\r\n ? Clean captions and text overlays\n\r\n ? Understanding of what performs on Reels/TikTok/Shorts\n\r\n ? Fast turnaround - I’m traveling soon and need content posted while it’s timely, not weeks later\n\r\nWhat I’m Looking For:\n\r\n? Creative eye - Can spot interesting \nnts and turn them into engaging stories? Self-starter - Can work with direction but also bring your own ideas? Growth mindset - Excited to learn new AI tools and build high-value skills? Long-term thinker - This starts with travel content, but the goal is to grow together\n\r\nTo Apply - PLEASE INCLUDE:\n\r\n???? Portfolio: Links to 2-3 Reels, TikToks, or YouTube Shorts you’ve created (travel/lifestyle content preferred but not required)\n\r\n???? Tools: What editing software do you use? (CapCut, DaVinci Resolve, Premiere, etc.)\n\r\n? Availability: How many hours per week can you commit?\n\r\n? Why you: What excites you about this opportunity specifically?\n\r\nApplications without portfolio links of some kind (even if it’s your personal Instagram) will not be reviewed.\n\r\nThis isn’t just a VA job - it’s a chance to learn high-value skills and grow your earning potential. If that excites you, I’d love to see your work!                ",

    "description": "\n                    A bit about us:\n\r\nI run \n. We help New Zealanders who have lost their driver’s licences get back on the road legally so they can keep their jobs and support their families.\n\r\n\n\r\nLosing a licence in NZ is a massive crisis for most people. We provide the \"pathway out\" by preparing their Limited Licence applications. \n\r\n\n\r\nOur new clients fill out an online form and then their data is automatically merged into our precedents. A detail orientated person then needs to revise the documents to turn the information that our clients have provided into polished and formatted court ready documents.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role:\n\r\nI am looking for a sharp, detail-obsessed Law Graduate (Juris Doctor) or a high-level Legal VA to join the team as a Legal Document Editor.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour job is to take the drafts our system generates and give them a rigorous \"human polish.\" You’ll be ensuring that the Affidavits sound authentic, the Draft Orders are legally precise, and every single detail is accurate and correct.\n\r\n\n\r\nI presently have two staff based in New Zealand who handle the whole process. We are wanting to have someone dedicated to  the initial document so that we can focus on client management and the other elements in the application process/\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role will begin solely in document drafting but there is room for the role to grow into handling other aspects of the business.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll be doing:\n\r\n\n\r\nDocument Editing: Taking the raw data a client puts into our form and smoothing it out so it reads as a professional, sworn statement for a Judge.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe \"Logic Check\": If a client says they work in Auckland but their driving route says Christchurch, you need to catch that. You are the filter that prevents embarrassing errors in court.\n\r\n\n\r\nFurther Information: Our clients frequently give us incomplete and poor answers. We need you to pick up on what further information would be required to complete the document.\n\r\n\n\r\nPolice/Court Readiness: Making sure the final PDF is formatted exactly how a Registrar or Police Prosecutor expects to see it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho you are:\n\r\n\n\r\nA Law Degree is a massive plus. If you've spent years reading and drafting motions or orders, you’ll find this work straightforward but rewarding.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are a \"Detail Hawk.\" You’re the type of person who gets annoyed by a misplaced comma or a inconsistent font.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand \"High Stakes.\" You know that if we get a driving hour wrong (e.g., 7am instead of 7pm), our client could end up in legal trouble. You take that responsibility seriously.\n\r\n\n\r\nNative-level English. Your writing should be indistinguishable from a New Zealand legal professional.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Setup:\n\r\n\n\r\nPay: Pay is dependent on qualifications and experience. If you are a JD who is over-qualified for \"general VA\" work, this may be a good role for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply (The Attention Test):\n\r\nI get a lot of applications, so I only respond to those who follow these steps:\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: \"Limited Licence Specialist - [your name]\n\r\n\n\r\nAttach a CV and an example document that you have drafted.\n\r\n\n\r\nI’m looking for a long-term partner who wants to help me scale this business as we grow.

    "description": "\n                    VFX / Velocity Editor - Lethal Luxury Short-Form Video\n\r\n\n\r\n**Brand:** Prismiera (Luxury Jewelry)\n\r\n**Pay:** $1100 USD/month\n\r\n**Type:** Full-time, 40 hours/week\n\r\n**Location:** Remote (Philippines)\n\r\n**Software:** Premiere Pro + After Effects (mandatory)\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## The Mission\n\r\n\n\r\nPrismiera is a pre-launch luxury jewelry brand launching a short-form video series - 35–50 second stories about mythology, history, spies, poisoners, queens, alchemists, and other on-brand topics posted across TikTok, Reels, and YouTube Shorts.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe aesthetic is **History and mythology meets high fashion**. The editing energy is closer to a perfectly-timed **After Effects edit** than a corporate product video. Every cut serves the story.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will receive a script, a voiceover file, and a mood reference. Your job is to **build the scene from nothing**: generate AI visuals, voiceovers, source archival footage, layer sound design, and deliver a short where every second earns the next. A visual storyteller.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## The Style\n\r\n\n\r\n**YES:** Dark luxury. Museum. AE VFX edit. Stylish/Lethal. Rich textures. Clean typography. Controlled palette. Both silence and impact used with intention.\n\r\n\n\r\n**NO:** CapCut default presets. Anything that looks like a stock photo slideshow or a corporate deck.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand that more effects does not necessarily mean better. Every cut has a reason.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Core Skills (Non-Negotiables)\n\r\n\n\r\n**Motion Graphics** You can build scenes, transitions, and visual elements from scratch in After Effects - not just cut footage.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Voiceover-First Storytelling.** You are editing to a *narration* primarily, music track second. You know when to let a line breathe and when to accelerate. You never bury the script's punchline under a flashy transition. The voice leads - the visuals serve.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Retention Instinct.** You understand that the first frame is an ad for the second frame. You know what stops a scroll. You build hooks visually, not just with text overlays. Every 2–3 seconds, something changes.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Rhythm & Beat-Sync.** You can sync cuts, zooms, and effects to music. You understand \"the drop.\" If you've made AMVs, fan/anime edits, or phonk edits, you already have this skill - we want you to apply it with restraint.\n\r\n\n\r\n**AI-Assisted Asset Creation.** You are comfortable generating images and short clips using tools like Midjourney or Kling. (We usually move onto new tools as soon as they are released). You treat AI as a production tool, not a novelty. We provide all paid accounts - you bring the creative judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Bonus Skills (Not Required, But We'll Notice)\n\r\n\n\r\n- After Effects compositing - Mocha tracking, light matching (future projects will involve product placement in video scenes)\n\r\n- Typography sense - fonts that feel intentional, never default\n\r\n- Color grading - pushing AI output and footage into a consistent palette\n\r\n- Sound design beyond music - layering SFX on movement, crafting risers and hits\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Weekly Output\n\r\n\n\r\n**Ramp-up (first 2–3 weeks):** 2–3 shorts as you learn the brand voice and pipeline.\n\r\n**Steady state:** 4–5 shorts per week at the locked quality standard.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work from clear creative briefs with reference scripts, mood boards, and audio clips for most batches.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## How to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\n**Do not send a generic cover letter.**\n\r\n\n\r\n**Subject line:** Lethal Editor - [Your name]\n\r\n\n\r\nUse 7 apply points or more when applying.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Send the following (in this order):**\n\r\n\n\r\n1. **The Story Test.** Link to ONE short-form video you edited that includes **voiceover or spoken dialogue**. We need to see that you can pace visuals to a script.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. **The AE Style Test.** Link to ONE video that shows your **visual rhythm and editing craft** - an AMV, fan edit, fashion reel, or anything where the editing itself is the skill. It doesn't need to be \"dark\" or \"luxury.\" It needs to show us how you think about pacing and impact.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. **AI Experience (1 sentence).** What is your experience level with generative AI tools (Midjourney, seedream, Kling, etc.)? If none, say so - we'll evaluate the rest of your application on its own merits.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. **Hardware.** Your PC specs: CPU / GPU / RAM. Plus your internet upload speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. **Turnaround Estimate.** How long does a 30–50 second high-quality short typically take you, start to finish?\n\r\n\n\r\n6. **The Rewrite.** Rewrite this sentence to sound dark, powerful, and modern: *\"She is really cool and strong and she wins.\"*\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Paid Trial (Shortlisted Candidates)\n\r\n\n\r\nBefore any full-time commitment, we run a weekly paid trial. We provide real scripts and style references. You deliver 30–50 second shorts. Trial is compensated at $250 USD at the end of each week (after work). If it's a mutual fit after 30 days, we transition to $550 USD payments every 2 weeks (before work).\n\r\n\n\r\nThis protects both of us - you see whether the work fits your strengths, we see whether the output fits our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## What We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Paid accounts** for all frontier AI tools; seedance2.0, seedream5.0, etc.\n\r\n- **Creative identity** - you're building the visual identity of a brand from launch, not filling someone else's template\n\r\n- **Clear briefs** - most, if not every batch comes with scripts, audio files, mood boards, and specific reference videos\n\r\n- **Direct feedback** - specific, constructive notes on every edit.\n\r\n- **A brand worth building** - Prismiera launches April 2026. A second AI native game/anime brand after that. You're not joining a machine. You're helping build one.                ",
