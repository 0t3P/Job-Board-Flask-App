The majority of our clients come through financial advisors and professional referral partners.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are building out a referral-based WordPress platform that allows our agents to:\n\r\n • Track their referred clients\n\r\n • See status updates\n\r\n • View referral fee payouts\n\r\n • Receive automated notifications when clients hire\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a defined ~89hour project. If it goes well, this can turn into ongoing development work across multiple projects.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nProject Overview\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need an experienced WordPress developer to help implement functionality on a referral portal connected to:\n\r\n • WordPress\n\r\n • Clio / Clio Grow (CRM)\n\r\n • Possibly Zapier or API connections\n\r\n • SMS notification system\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT just a basic website build.

Automated Notification When Client Hires\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen a client is marked as “Hired” in Clio:\n\r\n\n\r\nThe referring agent should automatically receive:\n\r\n • A TEXT message (ideal)\n\r\n • Or\n as backup\n\r\n\n\r\nExample message:\n\r\n“???? Congratulations! Your client has hired the law firm. Your referral fee is on the way.”\n\r\n\n\r\nWe prefer SMS delivery (Twilio or similar integration).\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nIdeal Candidate\n\r\n\n\r\nYou:\n\r\n • Have strong WordPress backend experience\n\r\n • Understand CRM integrations (Clio experience is a PLUS)\n\r\n • Can build secure role-based dashboards\n\r\n • Know how to work with APIs, webhooks, Zapier, or custom middleware\n\r\n • Think strategically, not just tactically\n\r\n • Communicate clearly\n\r\n • Work efficiently and respect timelines\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nTech Stack (Current + Potential)\n\r\n • WordPress\n\r\n • Clio / Clio Grow\n\r\n • Zapier\n\r\n • Twilio (for SMS)\n\r\n • Possibly Stripe integrations later\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nScope\n\r\n • Approx. 60 hours\n\r\n • Clear feature list\n\r\n • Defined deliverables\n\r\n • Structured milestone payments\n\r\n • Potential for long-term relationship\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are building multiple digital platforms and prefer to find a long-term development partner.\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include:\n\r\n 1.

We lean hard into the absurdity of it all, because frankly, history was wild and deserves to be treated that way.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Making\n\r\nThis role is focused entirely on motion graphics and map work — not editing.

We're also offering a paid test task before committing to the full episode, so you'll know exactly what you're getting into.\n\r\nTo Apply\n\r\nSend us your portfolio or showreel — especially anything with map animations or historical/documentary work.

Second Bridge Associates is looking for a Head of Acquisitions to serve as a key player in our company growth. We specialize in two primary asset classes:\n\r\n1) Short-Term Rentals (STRs)\n\r\n2) Seattle In-Fill Development Projects\n\r\n\n\r\nOur perfect fit for this role is a strategic partner who is excited to own our entire acquisitions pipeline. You will be the bridge between data analysis and the purchase of high-yield assets.\n\r\n\n\r\nAvailability & Timezone\n\r\n- Available to work Monday–Friday during Pacific Time (PST) hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Do\n\r\n- Own Seattle Development & STR Analysis: Develop deep expertise in STR and Seattle development math. You will have the final say on whether a deal meets our feasibility and ROI benchmarks.\n\r\n- Master the Deal Pipeline: Take full accountability for our deal flow ecosystem. You are accountable for a steady pipeline of 6-8 qualified deals a year. You’ll source opportunities through off-market outreach, wholesaler networks, and on-market channels.\n\r\n- Lead & Scale Operations: Own the entire team lifecycle from process creation to performance management. You’ll be responsible for creating robust SOPs, while serving as a mentor to our existing team. We look to you to identify talent gaps and strategically expand our acquisitions department as deal flow accelerates.\n\r\n- Strategize for Market Shifts: When the market moves, you move faster. You’ll proactively refine our buying criteria and pivot strategies to ensure we stay competitive.\n\r\n- Seamless Handoffs: Once a deal is inked, you’ll lead the transition to our operations team, ensuring every project starts with a clear roadmap and a shared vision.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\n- A Seasoned Pro: You have a proven track record in real estate acquisitions. You speak the language of sellers, agents, and wholesalers, and know how to build relationships with them.\n\r\n- A Systems Thinker: You don't just \"do\" work; you build systems and processes. You’re comfortable in Notion, CRMs, and data-tracking tools to find the right deals from your network and also track them to offers.\n\r\n- A Leader of Remote Teams: You know how to get the best out of a virtual team, keeping them motivated and high-performing.\n\r\n- Analytical & Decisive: You can look at a pro-forma and see the risks and rewards instantly. You make data-driven decisions, but you have the gut instinct of a sales closer.\n\r\n- High Energy & Growth-Oriented: You tackle challenges with a solutions-focused mindset and a touch of humor. You’re here to win and celebrate the wins with the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nIdeal Candidate Profile\n\r\n- 4+ Years in Real Estate Acquisitions: Deep experience in deal sourcing, offer negotiation, and closing - specifically in short-term rentals or in-fill development.\n\r\n- Proven Closer: You have a track record of hitting (and exceeding) volume targets and managing high-value pipelines.\n\r\n- Architect of Systems: Expert-level ability to build SOPs, design CRM workflows, and turn \"hustle\" into a repeatable machine.\n\r\n- Data-Driven Mindset: You live in spreadsheets; you are comfortable defining KPIs and adjusting strategy based on what the numbers say.\n\r\n- Tool Mastery: Proficiency across Workspace Tools (e.g., Google Sheets, Slack, Notion, Zillow, Redfin, MLS)\n\r\n- STR Enthusiast: You understand that Short-Term Rentals are a hybrid of real estate and hospitality. You know how to look at the qualitative factors that impact a property’s performance.\n\r\n- The \"Extreme Ownership\" Mindset: You don't wait for permission to fix a leak in the pipeline. You identify the problem, build the solution, and report on the results.\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus:\n\r\n- Existing relationships with Seattle-based wholesalers, brokers, or developers. \n\r\n- You have a background in Seattle real estate underwriting already or a deep understanding of urban in-fill development. You understand that a \"good deal\" in Seattle looks different than anywhere else.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Join Us?\n\r\nAt Second Bridge Associates, we value curiosity, independence, and results. We’re looking for someone who is excited to grow at our fast-paced company where they will be empowered to take on ownership from Day 1.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf that sounds like you, we’re excited to hear from you :) Ready to find our next great investment?

These are not only product drops but stories that hold dear to the community we are planning to build.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for a video editor who understands how to translate emotion into short-form content. Think of it as a POV come with me to design clothes, but all the design choices are related to a real life story that we are proud to share.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will turn provided storylines into emotionally compelling short-form videos centered around the story with the garment being the subject at the end.

At the end of it, I really should feel an emotional connection\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nResponsibilities\n\r\n • Follow a structured storyline and build a visual arc around it.\n\r\n • Source high-quality footage that reinforces themes of identity, struggle, growth, family, or culture.\n\r\n • Use sound design and music intentionally to create emotional depth.\n\r\n • Deliver platform-ready content for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.\n\r\n • Closely match a defined storytelling style (examples will be shared).\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n • Strong proficiency in Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or equivalent.\n\r\n • Proven ability to create emotionally driven edits.\n\r\n • Strong sense of pacing and restraint — knowing when to let \nnts breathe.\n\r\n • Attention to detail in typography, color grading, and transitions.\n\r\n • Experience editing for short-form vertical platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who understands that storytelling requires subtlety and control not over-editing.\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nTest Project\n\r\n\n\r\nShortlisted candidates will complete a paid test.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will receive:\n\r\n • A base storyline\n\r\n • A style reference video\n\r\n\n\r\nYour task is to produce a short-form edit that captures the emotional tone and visual style while honoring the story provided.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will assess:\n\r\n • Emotional execution\n\r\n • Story pacing\n\r\n • Creative judgment\n\r\n • Ability to interpret brand direction\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include:\n\r\n • Links to relevant work (especially emotionally driven edits).\n\r\n • A short note explaining why storytelling-based fashion content interests you.\n\r\n • Your availability and working hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nMy brand is building a collective of stories through garments.

This is not a support role — you will be the marketing department, and we're looking for someone who thrives with that kind of ownership and responsibility.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have a lot going on. We run Meta ad campaigns, weekly\n marketing, a robust relationship-marketing program that includes handwritten cards, monthly attorney newsletters, quarterly physician outreach, and two annual client events. We also work with an outside digital marketing agency that manages our website and SEO. What we need is someone who can take all of these moving pieces, bring them into a cohesive system, and drive real results.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Own\n\r\n\n\r\nYour day-to-day will span a wide range of activities. On the paid digital side, you'll plan, build, and optimize our\n and Instagram ad campaigns to reach injured workers who need legal help. You'll also manage our relationship with our digital marketing agency — reviewing their work, holding them to clear performance benchmarks, and pushing them to deliver better results on our website and search presence.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nOn the relationship marketing side, you'll manage our KEAP CRM and ensure our weekly\ns go out consistently and effectively. You'll oversee our monthly handwritten thank-you and birthday card program, our monthly business-tip letters to referring attorneys, and our quarterly outreach to physicians in our network. These programs are already running but need someone to systematize and elevate them.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll also plan and execute two annual events, our Santa Brunch and our Bingo Night, from initial logistics through invitations, execution, and post-event follow-up.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nFinally, you'll take the grassroots community campaigns we've been running informally and build them into organized, repeatable efforts with clear goals and tracking.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nAbove all else, you need to be exceptionally organized. This role has many moving parts and many recurring deliverables — if anything slips through the cracks, the whole program suffers. You should be someone who lives by their calendar, builds systems naturally, and follows through without being chased.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nBeyond organizational experience, we're looking for hands-on experience with Meta Ads Manager and lead-generation campaigns, ideally in legal, medical, or another consumer-facing industry. You should be comfortable with KEAP or a comparable CRM and\n automation platform. You should have sufficient digital marketing knowledge to have intelligent, challenging conversations with our external agency and to recognize when they're underperforming. Experience managing events, even small ones, is a plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong written English is essential. You'll be producing content that represents our firm to injured workers, referring attorneys, and physicians, and the tone and quality of that content matter.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience in legal marketing is a plus, but not required. What matters more is that you understand B2C lead generation, relationship-based marketing, and what it means to serve people going through difficult times.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the first 90 days, you'll have audited everything we're doing, built a master marketing calendar, taken over management of all active programs, and launched or relaunched our Meta ad campaigns. Within six months, our agency will be performing better or we'll have made a change, our nurture sequences will be tightened, and we'll have a clear picture of what's driving new clients and what isn't.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Join Us\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll have genuine ownership, a team that respects your expertise, and the resources to do the job well. Our firm has a clear mission: helping people who've been hurt on the job get the representation they deserve, and our marketing should reflect that. We're looking for someone who takes that seriously.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nSend your resume, a short note describing how you've managed multiple marketing programs simultaneously, and at least one example of a paid social or lead generation campaign you've run. Tell us about a marketing system or process you built from scratch. Applications without these details will not be considered.                ",

High-ticket projects, fast lead flow, zero fluff. We care about speed, clean comms, and booked shows.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe role:\n\r\nYou will own two critical parts of our operation. First, speed-to-lead. Your primary job is to call new leads in under five minutes, book qualified appointments, run confirmations and reschedules, and keep perfect notes inside our CRM (GoHighLevel). Second, you will act as our Onboarding Coordinator, guiding new clients through the setup process by managing communication and collecting necessary assets. This is not a technical role — our back-end team handles all deep GHL builds. Your focus is on speed, communication, and organization.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll do:\n\r\n\n\r\n•Call and text every new lead within five minutes during assigned hours.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Run a first-hour follow-up cadence and keep touching until a clear yes/no.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Book qualified leads to the calendar, send confirmation messages immediately, and manage reschedules fast.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Execute a confirmation routine to protect show rate.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Maintain clean, searchable notes with outcome, next step, and due time.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Operate basic CRM settings: place calls, send SMS, move stages, trigger templates, and update contact fields.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Act as the main point of contact for new clients during onboarding, guiding them through asset collection (e.g., logos, account access) and scheduling their kickoff call.\n\r\n\n\r\n•End of day: send a short numbers report with attempts, bookings, shows/no-shows, and blockers.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ve ideally done in the past:\n\r\n\n\r\n•Proven setter or SDR experience handling inbound leads and calendar bookings.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Consistent speed-to-lead under five minutes during your last role.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Strong phone presence, clear English, confident pace, and concise objection handling.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Hands-on with a dialer/CRM (GHL or similar) for daily calling and SMS.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Track record of maintaining or improving show rates via confirmations and reschedules.\n\r\n\n\r\nHours, Pay, and Growth:\n\r\n\n\r\n•Pay: Starts at $500 USD/month.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Hours: Part-time, 9am–1pm Mountain Time (20 hours/week) coverage required.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Growth Path: This role is planned to become full-time (40 hours/week) on April 27th, with a corresponding increase in base pay. This is a long-term position with a clear path for promotion into a Client Success or Operations Management role as the company scales. Performance bonuses will be implemented after a 6-month probation period.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply:\n\r\nSend one\n with the subject line: “Setter/Ops – I hit five minutes” and include:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.A 2-minute Loom introducing yourself, your hours, and your last role’s KPIs.\n\r\n\n\r\n2.Two raw call recordings to fresh inbound leads where you set an appointment.\n\r\n\n\r\n3.A short Loom screen share in any dialer/CRM showing you place a call, send an SMS, move a stage, log a note properly, and send a booking confirmation.\n\r\n\n\r\n4.A sample daily report you’ve actually used.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly applicants who follow these steps will be considered. If you’re reliable, fast, and love turning leads into shows, we want to hear from you!                ",
