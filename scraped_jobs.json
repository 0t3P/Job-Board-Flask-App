This is not a passive scheduling role. I need someone who lives on the platform, understands how conversations move in real time, and is willing to spend multiple hours per day actively scrolling, studying trends, engaging in discussions, and positioning our account in the middle of relevant conversations.\n\r\nYour core responsibility will be to grow the account aggressively and intelligently. That means posting consistently every single day, publishing high-volume content, testing formats, jumping on trends early, and building visibility through smart replies, quote tweets, and threads. You will actively comment on posts from relevant creators, founders, and industry leaders with thoughtful, knowledgeable insights that add value and attract profile clicks. The goal is to dominate attention in our niche and grow a loyal, engaged audience.\n\r\nYou will not operate randomly. We will work together to define core topic pillars and angles that align with my brand, business goals, and positioning. You will create a structured content plan that outlines themes, recurring formats, thread ideas, viral hooks, educational breakdowns, and contrarian takes. From there, you execute at scale. This role requires both strategy and speed. You must be able to think independently, generate original ideas daily, and adapt based on performance data.\n\r\nYou should deeply understand how\n’s algorithm and culture work. You know how to craft hooks that stop the scroll, how to write punchy short posts, how to build high-retention threads, and how to engineer engagement loops. You understand what makes content shareable and how to create posts that spark replies, bookmarks, and reposts. You are comfortable analyzing analytics, tracking what performs, and doubling down on winning formats.\n\r\nThis position requires someone proactive, creative, and slightly obsessive about growth. You should enjoy spending hours inside the platform, spotting opportunities before others, and pushing content volume without losing quality. Speed matters. Consistency matters. Presence matters.\n\r\nIf you are someone who wants to help build a powerful personal brand, understands internet culture deeply, and is ready to treat\n growth like a serious performance game, this role is for you.

This is ongoing work and requires someone who actually understands how Reddit functions, not just how to scroll it.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll need atleast 3+ devices (Android only). If you own multiple devices, that’s a plus and allows you to earn more. Expect roughly one hour of work per device each day.\n\r\n\n\r\nEach day you’ll post content across several subreddits.\n\r\n\n\r\nA critical part of this role is reading the room. The videos we provide can range from humorous to emotional to awkward or uncomfortable. You need to instantly recognize the tone and write posts that feel natural for that type of content. If you post everything the same way, you’ll fail.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll also be responsible for finding appropriate subreddits for each video. That means reviewing community rules, understanding what performs well there, and making sure your post doesn’t look forced or out of place. If you can’t do that consistently, this position isn’t for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re looking for people who think independently, adapt fast, and don’t need their hand held. Prior Reddit experience is helpful but not mandatory if you learn quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a long-term opportunity for dependable workers. Compensation is solid and can increase based on results and how many devices you use.\n\r\n\n\r\nEarnings:\n\r\nMost contributors earn $100–$500 per month, depending on consistency and the number of devices used.\n\r\n\n\r\nTime Commitment:\n\r\nDaily time commitment ranges from about 1 to 5 hours, depending on how many devices you’re using\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, include:\n\r\n• how many devices you can work with\n\r\n• your experience using Reddit\n\r\n• when you’re available each day                ",

    "description": "\n                    JOB TITLE: Short-Form Video Editor (After Effects) — AI, Instagram/TikTok\n\r\nSALARY: $1,100 USD/month\n\r\nTYPE: Full-time (40 hours/week)\n\r\nLOCATION: Remote (Philippines)\n\r\nSCHEDULE: Async, with Vancouver overlap (PST) for feedback\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE MISSION\n\r\n\n\r\nPrismiera is a luxury jewelry brand with a short-form video series already producing cinematic content on YouTube — mythology, history, goddess archetypes, and Dark Academia aesthetics.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone to own the Instagram and TikTok side.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT repurposing YouTube content into different aspect ratios. This is building platform-native content that makes a woman feel powerful in under 20 seconds. You'll create original short-form edits and cinematic skits using AI-generated footage, voiceovers, and atmospheric visuals — designed from the ground up for how Instagram and TikTok audiences actually consume.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe other half of this role: you'll be working with our AI-generated personas who serve as the visual anchor across our short-form content. You'll generate, composite, integrate, and stylize AI character visuals into edits that feel striking and intentional, not gimmicky. If the idea of building a visual identity around an AI persona excites you, keep reading!\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE STYLE\n\r\n\n\r\nThe content mix you'll produce:\n\r\n\n\r\n65% VIBE & SCENARIO — The kind of reel a woman sends to her group chat with no caption because the vibe speaks for itself.\n\r\n\n\r\n25% CINEMATIC SKITS — High-end, visually stunning executions of viral formats and dark humor. The premise can be slightly unhinged or ironic, but the visuals never break luxury. Think high-end perfume commercial meets TikTok audio trend. The Goddess is never the butt of the joke — she's the punchline, and she always wins.\n\r\n\n\r\n10% SENSORY / EXPERIMENTAL — Layered, fast, loop-optimized. Visual overload with mythological texture. The algorithmic wildcard.\n\r\n\n\r\nYES: Aspirational. Lethal elegance. Fashion-edit energy. Dark femininity. Music-driven impact. Content that feels like a luxury car reel meets ancient mythology. Cinematic skits using our AI personas — high-production value, deadpan, surreal, or darkly ironic.\n\r\n\n\r\nNO: CapCut presets. Generic motivational quote reels. Low-effort vlog-style acting. Slapstick comedy. Anything that looks like it was made in Canva. Anything that cheapens a demi-luxury product.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\n\n\r\nCreate & Adapt: Produce original Instagram/TikTok-native content using AI-generated visuals, trending audio, and our brand's mythology. Some pieces you'll build from scratch. Others you'll adapt from assets in our YouTube production pipeline. Either way, you're not resizing — you're crafting content shaped for how each platform rewards engagement.\n\r\n\n\r\nCinematic Skits: Build short-form skits around our AI personas that use trending formats, dark humor, or deadpan irony — executed at a visual level that never drops below luxury. People share it for the joke, follow the page for the aesthetic.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Persona Integration: Composite and stylize our AI-generated characters into edits as a visual anchor. She's not a narrator in your content — she's the presence. The face the eye locks onto while mythology and music layers move around her.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Content Generation: You won't just receive AI assets — you'll create them. Using tools like Seedance 2.0 and Seedream, you'll generate goddess visuals, atmospheric environments, and character footage that feed directly into your edits. You're both the director and the editor.\n\r\n\n\r\nMusic-Sync Editing: Your cuts, transitions, and visual reveals are married to the beat. You understand rhythm as a storytelling tool. Swells, drops, silence, impact — all intentional.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlatform Instinct: You understand what Instagram rewards vs. what TikTok rewards. You know what gets saved on IG. You know what gets looped on TikTok. You design for those behaviors, not just for visual quality.\n\r\n\n\r\nInstagram Packaging: Beyond the Reel itself — you contribute to grid cohesion, caption strategy, and Story sequencing. The profile should make someone think \"I want to be part of this\" within 2 seconds of landing.\n\r\n\n\r\nVolume at Speed: Once your templates and aesthetic are locked, your turnaround per piece should be significantly faster than building from zero. We expect high output.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nCORE REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter Effects (Mandatory). Compositing, layering, motion graphics, light/shadow matching. This is your primary tool. You build visual experiences, not just cuts.\n\r\n\n\r\nPremiere Pro. For project handoffs and consistency with the rest of the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Generation Fluency. This is not optional. You'll be using frontier AI tools daily — not just editing AI output, but generating it. You'll learn to prompt, iterate, select, and refine AI-generated visuals as a core part of your production workflow. We provide paid accounts for all tools (Seedance 2.0, Seedream, and whatever launches next). What we need is someone who treats these tools as creative instruments, not novelties.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Aesthetic Eye. You instinctively know the difference between aspirational and try-hard. Between elegant and overproduced. Between powerful and loud. Your edits make people feel something before they consciously understand what they're looking at.\n\r\n\n\r\nMusic & Rhythm. You've made edits where the music drives the visuals — AMVs, fashion reels, phonk edits, fan edits, whatever. You understand pacing as a weapon. You know what \"the drop\" means and you know when NOT to use it.\n\r\n\n\r\nLoop Thinking. You design edits that reward rewatching. The cut that lands on beat, the detail you only catch the second time, the seamless loop point. You think in circles, not lines.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong English. Daily async communication — clear, direct, professional.\n\r\n\n\r\nReliable & Coachable. You hit deadlines or warn early. You take direct feedback and iterate fast. You flag problems with options, not excuses.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nBONUS SKILLS (Not Required, But We'll Notice)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Color grading — pushing AI output and mixed footage into a consistent luxury palette\n\r\n- Typography sense — text overlays that feel intentional and premium\n\r\n- Sound design — SFX layering beyond just music (risers, hits, atmospheric texture)\n\r\n- Carousel / static design for Instagram companion posts\n\r\n- Understanding of Instagram analytics — saves, shares, completion rates, and what drives them\n\r\n- Experience building visual identities for brands or personas on social media\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWEEKLY OUTPUT\n\r\n\n\r\nRamp-up (first 2–3 weeks): 3–5 pieces as you learn the brand aesthetic, lock your AE templates, learn the AI generation tools, and calibrate with the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nSteady state: 10–15 pieces per week across Instagram and TikTok — a mix of original productions and asset-based adaptations depending on the content calendar.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW THIS ROLE FITS\n\r\n\n\r\nOther editors handle cinematic YouTube production and visual effects — you own social media. Same mythology, same brand, different platform behavior. Each editor has a distinct lane, and yours is how Prismiera looks and feels on Instagram and TikTok.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nRAM: 16GB minimum (32GB preferred) + SSD\n\r\nReliable high-speed internet (upload speed matters)\n\r\nMust run After Effects, Premiere Pro, and browser-based AI tools simultaneously\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nPAID TRIAL (Shortlisted Candidates)\n\r\n\n\r\nBefore any full-time commitment, we run a weekly paid trial. We provide real assets from our production pipeline, style references, and the AI persona visuals. You deliver content. Trial is compensated at $250 USD at the end of each week. If it's a mutual fit after 30 days, we transition to regular bi-weekly payments (before work).\n\r\n\n\r\nThis protects both sides — you see whether the work fits your strengths, we see whether the output fits our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\r\n\n\r\n- Paid accounts for all frontier AI tools — Seedance 2.0, Seedream, and whatever launches next\n\r\n- Creative ownership — you're defining how a luxury brand looks and feels on Instagram and TikTok from day one\n\r\n- An AI persona to build around — not a hypothetical, an active visual identity you'll shape and evolve\n\r\n- A role that evolves as the tools evolve — this job will look different in six months, and that's the point\n\r\n- Clear briefs — asset libraries, mood references, and specific direction for every batch\n\r\n- Direct feedback — specific, constructive notes on every edit\n\r\n- A brand worth building — Prismiera launches soon. A second AI-native brand is incubating behind it. You're not joining a finished machine. You're helping build one.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION\n\r\n\n\r\n$1,100 USD/month. Paid trial at $250 USD/week, transitioning to bi-weekly payments of $550 (before work) after 30 days.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nOWNERSHIP & CONFIDENTIALITY\n\r\n\n\r\nAll outputs (edits, project files, prompts, generated assets, persona visuals) are Prismiera property and must remain confidential.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a generic cover letter.\n\r\nUse 7 apply points or more when applying.\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: PRISMIERA SOCIAL — [Your Name]\n\r\n\n\r\nSend the following (in this order):\n\r\n\n\r\n1. The Vibe Test. Link to ONE edit you've made that is aspirational, aesthetic, or fashion-adjacent — or a skit that demonstrates platform-native virality instinct. Format doesn't matter. The feeling does.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. The Rhythm Test. Link to ONE edit where the music drives the visuals. Show us your beat-sync instinct. (Can overlap with #1 if one video demonstrates both.)\n\r\n\n\r\n3. The Creative Instinct Test (3–5 sentences total). You're given a 45-second cinematic video about a queen who poisoned her entire court, a folder of our AI Goddess visuals, and a dark atmospheric beat. Pitch two reworks: (A) a 15-second Instagram Reel designed to get saved — tell us your audio choice, pacing, and what the first 2 seconds look like; and (B) a 15-second cinematic skit that uses dark or deadpan humor without losing the luxury feel.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. AI Experience (1–2 sentences). What is your experience level with generative AI tools? If none, say so — we'll evaluate the rest on its own merits.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Hardware. Your PC specs: CPU / GPU / RAM. Plus your internet upload speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Turnaround Estimate. Given existing footage, a music track, and an established AE template — how long would a 15–20 second piece take you?\n\r\n\n\r\n7. The Rewrite. Rewrite this sentence to sound dark, powerful, and aspirational: \"She is really cool and strong and she wins.\"                ",

    "description": "\n                                        \n\r\n                    Hi! \n\r\nMy name is Priscila, originally from Brazil and living in the US. I spent 20 years at Procter & Gamble and left recently to build my own businesses. I’m now growing a personal brand on LinkedIn, running consulting projects, building a coaching practice, and organizing a TEDx event.\n\r\n\n\r\nThings are moving fast. But I’m doing too much myself, and the things I’m doing manually are things that someone with real experience could do faster and better.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can learn more about me here: \n/in/priscila-pree-silva\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nThe work has three elements to it:\n\r\n• Content and design — creating LinkedIn carousels, infographics, lead magnets, and other visual content in Canva or Figma. Scheduling, repurposing, and helping grow my presence on LinkedIn.\n\r\n• Operations and project management —\n marketing, SOPs, project tracking, keeping tools and systems organized. You keep things from falling apart so I can focus on clients and content.\n\r\n• Personal support — calendar, travel, family coordination, reminders.\n\r\nAs the business grows, the role will evolve. I need someone who’s excited by that, not threatened by it.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI PROFICIENCY IS ESSENTIAL\n\r\nI use AI daily. I expect you to use AI tools as a multiplier in everything you do.\n\r\n• When I ask you to research 20 podcast hosts, you don’t spend 8 hours Googling. You use AI to build an initial list in 30 minutes, then spend your time verifying it.\n\r\n• When you draft a message, you use AI to generate options, then apply your judgment to pick and refine the best one.\n\r\n• When we need a new SOP, you use AI to draft the framework, then refine it based on reality.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI handles the 60% that’s mechanical. You handle the 40% that requires judgment, creativity, taste, and human connection. Together we operate like a team of 5.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Makes This Role Different\n\r\nI’m not looking for someone who waits for instructions. I’m looking for someone who:\n\r\n• Brings expertise I don’t have. You’ve supported creators or entrepreneurs before. You see me about to make a mistake you’ve seen before and you say something.\n\r\n• Gets things in order. I’m a builder who understands the value of structure. I am trying to grow my ventures right and need someone that ensures there is structure with the \nntum.\n\r\n• Gives honest feedback. If you have a better idea, tell me.\n\r\n• Thinks like a partner. I want someone who grows with the business, takes on more responsibility over time, and has real input into how we work.\n\r\n• Helps build the team. As the business continues to grow, I’ll look to you to help identify and bring on additional support. If you know great people, even better.\n\r\n\n\r\nKEY AND ESSENTIAL SKILLS\n\r\n• Excellent written English communication skills\n\r\n• Very strong attention to detail\n\r\n• Positive 'can do' attitude and willingness to take on tasks and learn new things\n\r\n• Willing to work hard and want to grow professionally\n\r\n• Proficiency with AI tools\n\r\n• LinkedIn knowledge, you understand the platform and the culture\n\r\n• Proactive communication, you flag problems early and push back respectfully\n\r\n\n\r\nPAY \n\r\n• $\n/month full-time (40 hrs/week) depending on experience and skills\n\r\n• Open to taking on 2 part-time tea\nmbers instead if your skills are excellent in a specific area\n\r\n\n\r\nPERKS\n\r\n• You control your own time as long as you have a few hours around 7:30AM EST-9:00AM EST. \n\r\n• Flexible time off. If you need time off just let me know 2 weeks in advance.\n\r\n\n\r\nAPPLYING FOR THE JOB\n\r\nSend me an\n to \n\r\nSubject: Virtual Assistant - [Your Name]\n\r\nInclude:\n\r\n1. Short intro (3-5 sentences): Why would you like this position and why are you a good fit for it. \n\r\n2. AI tool experience: Which tools, how often, one concrete example of how AI made your work better.\n\r\n3. Design samples: Portfolio link or 2–3 examples of social media content you’ve created.\n\r\n4. Availability and expected monthly rate.\n\r\n5. What software and tools do you use (for\n, creative work, research and AI)\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include your CV and creative portfolio. \n\r\n\n\r\nI am looking for a tea\nmber for the long term and will offer raises and bonus’ based on performance as we grow the company and you progress. Therefore I will only look at applicants that really want the role.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are invited to the interview stage, there will be a written and creative task that will be paid. If successful at this stage, there will be a short video call between us and video and spoken English will be required. \n\r\n\n\r\nThank you for reading the application. \n\r\n\n\r\nPree                                                ",

We are moving from a \"startup\" phase into a professionalized \"Operations\" phase.\n\r\nWe aren't looking for a task-taker; we are looking for a Controller—someone who thinks like an owner, protects our cash flow, and ensures our systems remain airtight as we scale.\n\r\n\n\r\nPOSITION OVERVIEW\n\r\nSalary Range: $525 – $785 USD / Month. 20 hours/ week ($6.00 – $9.00/hr for 20 hours/week).\n\r\nHours: 20 hours per week (Target: 9:00 AM – 1:00 PM US Eastern Time).\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY JOIN DREAM CABIN GETAWAYS?\n\r\nGrowth-Minded & Solutions-Focused: We don’t dwell on problems; we find solutions. We want people who are hungry to learn, grow, and improve our systems every day.\n\r\n\n\r\nPositive Energy: Property management sometimes involves surprise challenges. Pipes burst, tenants stop paying. It is critical that we approach our work with a positive attitude. We value collaboration, open communication, and a \"can-do\" spirit.\n\r\nA Relationship, Not a Transaction: We want a years-long partnership where you feel supported, trusted, and empowered to make decisions.\n\r\n\n\r\nImpact Over Activity: We value outcomes. You won't be micromanaged; you will be given clear goals and the freedom to execute, along with the support to be able to succeed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR WEEKLY FOCUS\n\r\n10?counting & Trust Management: You handle complex deposit reconciliations (OwnerRez/Airbnb/Vrbo) into REIhub and generate professional Monthly Owner Statements for our PM clients.\n\r\n\n\r\n60% Operations & Loop-Closing: You own maintenance from \"Reported\" to \"Invoiced\". You enforce the 24-Hour No-Update Rule, providing proactive status updates on all open projects in \n without being prompted.\n\r\n\n\r\n20% Financial Administration: You audit and pay contractor invoices, ensuring billed hours match agreements. You manage purchasing for cabin supplies to keep our \"jewel properties\" guest-ready.\n\r\n\n\r\n10% High-Level Support: You provide expert backup for our STR Manager (Jeneff) during her time off.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Experience & Technical Skills\n\r\nExperience: 3+ years in US-based Property Management is required. You must understand the \"rhythm\" and details of property management—from lease renewals to emergency repairs. Short term and long-term experience a plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nFinancial Rigor: Proven experience with Accounting for Real Estate including Short Term Rentals. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe Tech Stack: While we use OwnerRez, REIhub, and \n, we value your PM and Accounting Experience over your specific software experience. If you are an expert in the industry, and familiar with competitor tools, we can train you on our specific stack.\n\r\n\n\r\nAssertiveness: You are comfortable \"chasing\" contractors and tenants with a smile, and holding vendors accountable to their bids.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nTo verify your attention to detail and financial expertise, please follow these steps exactly:\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject Line: Include the name of the original bass player for the Grateful Dead.\n\r\n\n\r\nCover Letter (Paragraph 3): Include the phrase \"closing the loop.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Initiative Test: Describe a specific time you solved a contractor or tenant problem without waiting for direction.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Financial Filter: Briefly describe your past accounting/bookkeeping work. Specifically:\n\r\n\n\r\nWhich software have you used (REIhub, QBO, Xero)?\n\r\nHave you ever managed Trust Accounting or Owner Statements?\n\r\nIn 2-3 sentences, how do you handle a situation where an Airbnb payout doesn't match the expected booking amount in your PMS (like OwnerRez)?

    "description": "\n                    This is not a VA job. This is the engine room role. You earn $100 every time any rep on the team closes a deal, because you made sure the machine that produced that deal was working correctly. As the team scales, your override income scales with it. You also earn a small residual for every client that stays on the monthly care plan, which means your income compounds as long as you keep the team performing and clients retained.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\nYou are the operating layer between the sales team and the founder. The founder should not be dealing with day-to-day rep questions, call quality issues, or CRM hygiene problems. That's your job. You start every morning by checking that the calendar has open slots, leads are loaded, and yesterday's calls are logged. Then you pull call recordings and audit them, 10 per setter, 5 per closer, every day.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou enforce the rules: no disposition logged means no commission, and you are the one who holds that line. You post the weekly scoreboard every Friday. You run the one-hour Sales System Review each week with the team. You approve or reject the weekly lead list. You own the pipeline, if a deal is stuck or a stage is wrong, you catch it within 24 hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou do not source leads. You do not build automations. You do not do client installs. You do not close deals. Your job is to make sure the people doing those things are doing them correctly, and to catch problems before they reach the founder.\n\r\n\n\r\nHard Disqualifiers\n\r\nIf you have never managed or supervised a team, this role is not for you yet. If you would not be comfortable telling a rep their commission is held because they didn't log their calls, this role is not for you. If you need someone to check your work daily, this role is not for you. This position requires someone who runs toward problems, not away from them. The Loom question about the underperforming setter is the actual interview. Answer it well and you're most of the way there.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n01\n\r\nRecord a 90-second Loom. Tell us your name and your experience managing or supervising a sales or operations team. Then answer this question live on camera: \"A setter on your team has missed their dial minimum for two days in a row. What do you do?\" How you answer tells us more than your resume.\n\r\n02\n\r\nSend your Loom link with your application. No Loom = no review. No exceptions for any reason.\n\r\n03\n\r\nIf your Loom passes, you'll receive the full team playbook to review and a short written scenario test within 48 hours. Pass the test and the role is yours.                ",

This is not a traditional accounting seat. We need a seasoned CPA who has lived in the trenches of hedge funds, high-growth startups, and complex multi-entity operations—and who brings the rare ability to build scalable, automated finance systems from the ground up.\n\r\nYou'll own the full finance function: month-end close, financial reporting, forecasting, compliance, and investor-ready deliverables. What sets this role apart is the expectation that you will also architect and automate the systems behind these processes—leveraging SQL, Brex, and modern tooling to eliminate manual work, improve data integrity, and unlock strategic insight.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Own\n\r\nFinancial Reporting & Close\n\r\nLead monthly, quarterly, and year-end close processes across multiple entities and currencies. Prepare US GAAP-compliant financial statements, management reports, and board-ready materials. Own revenue recognition, accruals, journal entries, intercompany eliminations, and reconciliations. Manage fund accounting, NAV calculations, and investor reporting as applicable.\n\r\nForecasting, Budgeting & Strategic Finance\n\r\nBuild and maintain dynamic forecasting and cash flow models that inform executive decision-making. Lead annual budgeting cycles and deliver monthly variance analysis with actionable narrative. Partner with leadership on scenario planning, capital allocation, and profitability analysis.\n\r\nFinance Systems & Automation\n\r\nDesign, build, and maintain automated financial workflows that eliminate manual bottlenecks. Write SQL queries (PostgreSQL) for financial reporting, data extraction, and reconciliation at scale. Develop Python scripts for trading system integrations, API-driven data pipelines, and financial automation. Build BI dashboards  and custom reporting systems for real-time financial visibility. Implement AI-assisted process optimization to continuously improve finance operations.\n\r\nCompliance, Tax & Legal Coordination\n\r\nOversee payroll processing, sales tax compliance, and government reporting requirements. Manage government compliance filings, loan applications, and audit preparation. Coordinate with external counsel and auditors on contract reviews, regulatory matters, and legal documentation.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nNon-Negotiables\n\r\n\n\r\nActive CPA license in good standing\n\r\n10+ years of progressive accounting experience spanning fund accounting, startup finance, and/or multi-entity operations\n\r\nDeep expertise in US GAAP financial reporting, monthly close, and consolidation\n\r\nProficiency in SQL (PostgreSQL preferred) for financial data querying and reporting\n\r\nHands-on experience with Python for financial automation, API integrations, or trading system support\n\r\nAdvanced Excel and Google Sheets skills including complex nested formulas, financial models, and automated dashboards\n\r\nDemonstrated ability to design and implement process automation and scalable finance workflows\n\r\nExperience with QuickBooks Online in a multi-entity environment\n\r\n\n\r\nStrongly Preferred\n\r\n\n\r\nBackground in hedge fund accounting, NAV reporting, or alternative investment operations\n\r\nExperience with BI/analytics platforms\n\r\nFamiliarity with Microsoft Access for custom reporting systems\n\r\nTrack record managing payroll, sales tax, and multi-state compliance\n\r\nExperience with government loan applications (SBA, PPP, EIDL, or similar)\n\r\nComfort operating in fast-paced, resource-constrained environments where you build the plane while flying it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Sets You Apart\n\r\nYou don't just close the books—you ask why the process took 10 days and engineer it down to 3. You see a messy reconciliation and build a powered pipeline to handle it. You understand that clean financial data is a strategic asset, not just a compliance obligation. You move fluidly between debits and credits, scripts, and board presentations.\n\r\nThe ideal candidate combines the analytical discipline of a Big 4-trained accountant with the builder's mindset of a startup operator. You're equally comfortable presenting to investors, debugging a data pipeline, and negotiating with auditors.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Two closes in a week is $800. Two closes every week for a month is $3,200. Our top target is 4 closes a week, that's $1,600 in a single week. We send you warm, pre-qualified demo slots. Your job is to run the 15-minute call, show them a live AI demo, walk through the ROI math, and collect payment on the call. The product sells itself once they hear the demo, we need a closer who knows how to seal it without letting them leave to \"think about it.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\nWe sell an AI voice agent to MedSpas, clinics that are losing patients every day to missed calls. Our setters book you onto 15-minute demo calls with clinic owners and practice managers. You show up, run the call on a proven script, have them call a live demo number on speaker so they hear the AI themselves, anchor the ROI math, and close.\n\r\n\n\r\nHard Disqualifiers\n\r\nIf you cannot handle objections live on camera, this role is not for you. If you need a base salary, this role is not for you. If \"let me think about it\" ends your deals, this role is not for you. We run a script-based process with zero tolerance for soft-closing. The Loom screening is non-negotiable. No Loom = no review, no exceptions made for any reason.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n01\n\r\nRecord a 90-second Loom. Tell us your name and high-ticket closing experience. Then handle this objection live on camera: \"This sounds interesting but I think it's too expensive for us right now.\" We're watching how you respond — not just what you say.\n\r\n02\n\r\nSend your Loom link with your application. No Loom = no review. This is not negotiable.\n\r\n03\n\r\nIf your Loom passes, you'll receive the demo script to review and a short roleplay test within 48 hours. Pass the roleplay and you start on your first live demos immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\nEvery demo ends one of three ways: payment collected on the call (ideal), payment promised within 24 hours, or a clear no. There is no \"I'll think about it and get back to you.\" Your job is to make sure they make a decision before the call ends.                ",

    "description": "\n                    I'm a tech/AI creator with 142K on Instagram, 280K on TikTok, and 18K on YouTube. My content about AI, robotics, and emerging technology has gone viral multiple times, my biggest videos have over 1M views. \n\r\n\n\r\nRight now I wear every hat, researching, scripting, strategizing, posting, community management, on top of being the one on camera. That means I'm only putting out 2-3 videos a week on Instagram and maybe 1 YouTube video every couple of months. I know I'm leaving massive growth on the table.\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm hiring you so I can stop doing everything and start doing the one thing that matters most: creating. With the right person in this role, we go from 2-3 Instagram posts a week to posting daily. We go from almost no YouTube presence to consistent weekly long-form content. We start repurposing everything into a Substack newsletter. And we build a real, loyal community across every platform, not just a follower count.\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm looking for a creative storyteller: someone who sees a story where other people see a headline, who instinctively knows what visuals would make a \nnt land harder, and who can help me turn complex technology into content that makes people feel something.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can use AI tools to accelerate research, organize ideas, or get a rough draft started — I'm not anti-AI. But what you deliver to me needs to sound unmistakably human, have a clear point of view, and be something I'd be proud to record. If your process is \"prompt ChatGPT, copy paste, send\" — this isn't the role for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you'll do:\n\r\nResearch AI/tech topics daily and develop 7-8 short-form video concepts per week, each with a strong hook, clear narrative structure, and an ending that makes the viewer feel something\n\r\nDevelop 1 long-form YouTube concept per week — full outline, script draft, and visual direction\n\r\nThink visually — suggest what b-roll to capture, what should be on screen at each \nnt, what diagrams or visuals would make a concept click\n\r\nOwn the cross-platform content strategy with a focus on building a loyal, invested community\n\r\nCreate Instagram and LinkedIn carousels in Canva that are on-brand and shareable\n\r\nRepurpose short-form and long-form scripts into Substack/newsletter articles\n\r\nCross-post and adapt content across IG, TikTok, LinkedIn, and YouTube — tailored for each platform, not just reposted\n\r\nRespond to comments and DMs in my voice to build real relationships with the audience\n\r\nAnalyze what's working weekly and adjust the strategy\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be:\n\r\nA natural storyteller who understands narrative structure, pacing, and emotional beats\n\r\nGenuinely curious about AI, tech, and science — you follow this space because you care\n\r\nAn excellent English writer whose work has voice, personality, and rhythm\n\r\nVisually minded — you think about what the viewer SEES, not just what they hear\n\r\nSomeone who understands that community is built through trust and consistency, not tricks\n\r\nProficient in Canva and comfortable working across multiple social platforms\n\r\nSelf-directed, reliable, and proactive\n\r\n\n\r\nStart: Immediate with 1-week paid trial\n\r\nWhy this role matters: This isn't a task-execution gig. You're coming in as the first creative partner on a brand that's actively growing with real revenue behind it. As the channel grows — more brand deals, more reach, more opportunities — this role grows with it. More hours, higher pay, expanded responsibility. I'm building a team and I want this person to be the foundation of it. If you help me build something big, you'll be a core part of it.\n\r\n\n\r\nTO APPLY — You MUST complete all 4 steps below. Applications that skip any of these steps will not be considered, no exceptions.\n\r\n1. Show me your work. Link to your portfolio, writing samples, scripts, carousels, or social media accounts you've managed. If you don't have a formal portfolio, show me anything that demonstrates your creative ability — a blog, a\n thread, a YouTube video, anything.\n\r\n2. The Story Test. Find any recent piece of tech or AI news from the past week. Don't just tell me what happened — pitch me the 60-second video. What's the hook? What's the story? What's the \nnt that makes someone stop scrolling? And tell me one visual or b-roll idea that would make this video hit harder than just someone talking to camera.\n\r\n3. The Community Question. What's the difference between a creator with 500K followers and low engagement versus a creator with 100K followers whose audience would buy anything they recommend? How do you build the second one? Be specific.\n\r\n4. The Honesty Question. Tell me how you use AI tools in your creative process. What's it good for? Where do you draw the line? I want to know that you have a thoughtful relationship                ",
