This is great if you like working by yourself in the quiet, but it can be terribly painful if you need the energy of coworkers nearby.\n\r\nOur Cultural Values - We're an American company with an incredibly unusual culture. Even by American standards, our 7 cultural values are highly unusual. Our culture is challenging for people accustomed to corporate culture and especially difficult for people who grew up in Confucian cultures. It's a great culture for people who speak directly and have a great deal of self-confidence and ownership. If you identify as a misfit, you'll do well.\n\r\nMultiple Software Systems - You're going to need to learn how to use 12 different software systems. This is great if you want to get exposed to and experience lots of technology, but it can be tough if you have a hard time learning technology. Secret Message - When you apply, you'll see a box that asks if you want to add anything else. Type in PINK ELEPHANT in all capital letters exactly as we've shown it here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCheat Code for getting a job with us:\n\r\n1) Our application comprises the majority of our recruiting process. Because of that, we suggest that you give us thoughtful responses and rich stories. We typically only interview applicants who give rich and detailed answers to our questions. If you write short responses so that you can hurry up and finish the application, you will not get interviewed.\n\r\n2) Tell us stories about how your actions match your beliefs and values. For example, if I say I value health and fitness, you don't know if I'm telling you the truth or if I'm just telling you what sounds good. But, if I tell you things I've done, I can illustrate my values of health and fitness with proof. For example, I go to the gym 4 days per week, I've done 6 triathlons, including an Ironman, and I can swim 3000 meters in one hour. My examples of things I've done prove that my actions match my values system.\n\r\n3) Be vulnerable and honest. We take very detailed notes during the interview process, and we conduct extensive background checks. If the stories you tell about yourself don't match what your references say, we will not hire you. We'd rather hire a C student who is honest about being a C student than someone who is a C student but tries to pass themselves off as an A student. Remember, this is an entry-level job. We're not looking for perfect. We're looking for an excellent cultural fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply: Please click on the link: \n/work-opportunities/administration-agent                ",

    "description": "\n                    # Virtual Executive Assistant — Executive Life & Business Support (Hospitality Focus)\n\r\n\n\r\n## About the Role (Please Read Carefully)  \n\r\n\n\r\nI am a California-based entrepreneur who operates multiple businesses, primarily in the restaurant and hospitality space (restaurants, bars, events, and related projects). My schedule, inbox, and priorities move quickly, and I rely on strong systems, clear communication, and disciplined follow-through.\n\r\n\n\r\nI am looking for an experienced Virtual Executive Assistant (EA) who can independently manage the core of my executive life — including inbox, calendar, priorities, and follow-ups — while also being comfortable taking on occasional, clearly scoped business-related tasks tied to my hospitality businesses.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a long-term role for a high-performing Executive Assistant, not an entry-level VA position. If you require basic training in\n, calendar, or task management, this is not the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## What This Role Is (and Isn’t)  \n\r\n\n\r\nThis role IS:  \n\r\n- Executive-life focused (inbox, calendar, priorities, follow-ups)  \n\r\n- Systematic, structured, and outcome-driven  \n\r\n- Best suited for someone who can operate with minimal direction  \n\r\n- Ideal for someone who understands the pace and urgency of hospitality  \n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is NOT:  \n\r\n- A general, unfocused “do everything” VA role  \n\r\n- Customer service, social media management, or cold calling  \n\r\n- A beginner or junior admin position  \n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Who You Are (Must-Haves)  \n\r\n\n\r\nPlease only apply if you genuinely meet most of these criteria:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou have:  \n\r\n- At least 3+ years of real Executive Assistant or Senior VA experience  \n\r\n- Strong written and spoken English (professional, clear, confident)  \n\r\n- Proven experience managing:  \n\r\n  - Busy executive inboxes  \n\r\n  - Complex calendars across multiple time zones  \n\r\n  - Follow-ups with vendors, partners, and internal teams  \n\r\n  - Task tracking and prioritization systems  \n\r\n\n\r\nYou are:  \n\r\n- Extremely detail-oriented and reliable  \n\r\n- Proactive (you anticipate needs instead of waiting for instructions)  \n\r\n- Comfortable working with a fast-paced business owner  \n\r\n- Trustworthy with confidential information  \n\r\n- Equipped with stable internet, a quiet workspace, and professional setup  \n\r\n\n\r\nPreferred (Nice to Have):  \n\r\n- Prior experience supporting someone in restaurants, hospitality, or events  \n\r\n- Familiarity with:  \n\r\n  - Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets)  \n\r\n  - Notion, Asana, Trello, or similar tools  \n\r\n  - Slack or similar messaging platforms  \n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Your Core Responsibilities (Primary Focus)  \n\r\n\n\r\n### 1) Inbox & Communication Management (Top Priority)  \n\r\n- Daily inbox triage and organization  \n\r\n- Clearly flag urgent items  \n\r\n- Draft responses when appropriate (using provided templates/examples)  \n\r\n- Keep\n threads moving forward and reduce my overall\n load  \n\r\n\n\r\n### 2) Calendar & Scheduling  \n\r\n- Manage my calendar efficiently  \n\r\n- Schedule meetings, calls, vendor visits, tastings, and appointments  \n\r\n- Confirm details, send reminders, and prevent conflicts  \n\r\n- Maintain a clear weekly overview so I am never surprised  \n\r\n\n\r\n### 3) Follow-Ups & “Waiting On” Tracker  \n\r\n- Maintain a simple, clean tracker of outstanding items  \n\r\n- Follow up with vendors, partners, contractors, or internal tea\nmbers as needed  \n\r\n- Ensure nothing falls through the cracks  \n\r\n\n\r\n### 4) Executive Support & Light Project Coordination (Hospitality Context)  \n\r\n\n\r\nFrom time to time, you may be asked to help with clearly defined, short-term business tasks such as:  \n\r\n- Reviewing whether certain action items are being completed by tea\nmbers  \n\r\n- Spot-checking or monitoring specific processes for a set period (e.g., “for the next two weeks, verify clock-ins are being done properly”)  \n\r\n- Organizing information and summarizing it back to me in a clear, concise way  \n\r\n- Light research (e.g., comparing options, gathering info, or compiling quotes)  \n\r\n\n\r\nThese requests will always be clear, scoped, and time-bound, not vague or open-ended.\n\r\n\n\r\n### 5) Document & Admin Support  \n\r\n- Format and polish internal documents, SOPs, menus, or proposals  \n\r\n- Create clean checklists or simple trackers when needed  \n\r\n- Keep files organized in Google Drive  \n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## What Success Looks Like (First 2–3 Weeks)  \n\r\n\n\r\nWithin your first few weeks, I expect:  \n\r\n- My inbox is significantly more manageable  \n\r\n- My calendar runs smoothly with fewer last-minute issues  \n\r\n- Follow-ups are consistent and well-documented  \n\r\n- You communicate clearly and ask smart clarifying questions  \n\r\n- You can execute tasks independently once briefed  \n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Hours & Pay  \n\r\n- Pay: Up to $10 USD per hour, based on experience and performance  \n\r\n- Hours: 20–30 hours per week to start, with potential to increase  \n\r\n- Required overlap: At least 2–4 hours per weekday with Pacific Time (California)  \n\r\n- This is a long-term position for the right person.  \n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## How to Apply (You MUST Follow These Steps)  \n\r\n\n\r\nTo be considered, you must submit all of the following:\n\r\n\n\r\n### 1) A 2–3 minute Loom or video introduction covering:  \n\r\n- Your background as an Executive Assistant  \n\r\n- The types of executives you have supported  \n\r\n- Your experience (if any) working with restaurants, hospitality, or fast-paced environments  \n\r\n- Why you believe you are a strong fit for this role  \n\r\n\n\r\n### 2) Short written answers to these questions:  \n\r\n- How do you typically triage and manage a busy inbox?  \n\r\n- How do you track follow-ups so nothing gets missed?  \n\r\n- What tools are you most comfortable using and why?  \n\r\n\n\r\n### 3) One example (you may redact private info):  \n\r\n- A tracker, calendar system, or organized document you have created  \n\r\n\n\r\n### Attention to Detail Test:  \n\r\nBegin your application with:  \n\r\n???? “Executive EA — I read the full post.”  \n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that do not follow these instructions will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Hiring Process  \n\r\n- Short interview  \n\r\n- Small paid test task  \n\r\n- 2-week trial period before final confirmation  \n\r\n\n\r\nI look forward to reviewing your application.

    "description": "\n                    About the Business\n\r\nI run a thoughtful, strategy-driven digital business focused on content, websites, and systems that provide consistent leads for my clients. This is not a corporate environment or a high-volume task factory. The work is intentional, structured, and detail-oriented.\n\r\n\n\r\nI value independence, clear communication, and people who take pride in completing work thoroughly. If you enjoy clean execution, problem-solving, and checking things off because they are truly finished, this role will be a strong fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nRole Summary\n\r\nThis role focuses on execution support for content, data organization, and website-related tasks. You will be given clear instructions and are expected to complete tasks independently, think through missing information, and ensure work is fully complete before marking tasks done.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is an outcome-focused role, not a micromanaged one.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho This Role Is For\n\r\nThis role is best suited for someone who is:\n\r\n• Detail-oriented and accurate\n\r\n• A self-starter who completes tasks without constant oversight\n\r\n• A proactive problem solver who fills in gaps instead of leaving tasks incomplete\n\r\n• Comfortable asking clarifying questions when genuinely needed\n\r\n• Respectful of deadlines and urgency\n\r\nIf this has you nodding your head yes, keep reading!\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\nYou will regularly be responsible for:\n\r\n1. Creating and scheduling content using provided templates, prompts, or AI tools\n\r\n2. Creating simple social media graphics using existing Canva templates\n\r\n3. Scheduling social media posts once content is approved\n\r\n4. Copying, formatting, and scheduling blog posts accurately\n\r\n5. Researching, organizing, and updating data with attention to detail\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Technical Skills\n\r\nTo succeed in this role, you should be comfortable with:\n\r\n1. Canva (template-based design only)\n\r\n2. WordPress (basic content updates and formatting, following instructions)\n\r\n3. Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Drive)\n\r\n4. ChatGPT or similar AI tools for content support\n\r\n5. Social media scheduling tools\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional Expectations (Important)\n\r\nThis role requires someone who can:\n\r\n• Follow instructions while thinking independently\n\r\n• Manage time reliably and communicate clearly\n\r\n• Be transparent about availability and timelines\n\r\n• Research missing information to complete tasks properly\n\r\n• Accept feedback and improve quickly\n\r\nIf you require constant step-by-step guidance or struggle to finish tasks fully, this role will not be a good fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Style & Support\n\r\n• You will receive clear written instructions and short video walkthroughs when needed\n\r\n• I am available for clarification questions, but expect problem-solving before escalation\n\r\n• No fixed working hours are required, as long as tasks are completed accurately and on time\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\nCompensation is competitive and based on experience, typically structured as an hourly rate with room-to-grow as the role expands. Exact details will be discussed during the interview.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nTo apply, please submit:\n\r\n1. A short introduction video explaining why this role caught your attention. You can use loom or another video recording program.\n\r\n2. A brief overview of your relevant experience with content, organization, or website work\n\r\n3. Your answer to the following question: What type of work makes you feel most “in the zone”?\n\r\nApplications that do not answer this question will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nFinal Note\n\r\nThis role is ideal for someone who enjoys structured work, takes ownership of outcomes, and values doing things right the first time. If that sounds like you, I’d love to hear from you.                ",
