Phase 2 only proceeds once Phase 1 is working correctly and I have signed off on it.\n\r\n\n\r\nData Sources\n\r\nMeta Marketing API\n\r\nDaily spend per ad account\n\r\nImpressions\n\r\nReach\n\r\nFrequency\n\r\nLink clicks\n\r\nCTR (link click-through rate)\n\r\nCPC (cost per link click)\n\r\nCPM\n\r\nClick > Landing page views%\n\r\nResults (purchases / conversions) - NOTE: the conversion event name varies per client account and must be configurable per client, not hardcoded\n\r\nCost per result\n\r\n\n\r\nGo High Level API\n\r\nPage views (sales page)\n\r\nLeads / opt-ins\n\r\nSales volumes by product tier: Core Offer, Bump, OTO1, OTO2 (naming is generic - actual product names vary per client but map to these tiers)\n\r\n\n\r\nGoogle Sheet Architecture\n\r\nTab 1 - Raw Daily Data\n\r\nOne row per day per client\n\r\nAll API-pulled fields listed above as columns\n\r\nA 'Notes / Change Log' column (manually filled by me - to track creative changes, headline tests, offer changes etc.)\n\r\nData overwrites the last 3 days on each run to account for Meta's attribution window (conversions are backdated up to 48 hours)\n\r\n\n\r\nTab 2 - Rolling Dashboard\n\r\nAggregated views: rolling 3-day, 7-day, and 30-day windows, auto-calculated from today's date\n\r\nCalculated metrics derived from raw data: CPA, AOV, ROAS, EPC, Sales Page CVR%, Bump CVR%, OTO1 CVR%, OTO2 CVR?shboard tab uses sheet formulas only - no additional API calls\n\r\nOne dashboard tab per client, or a consolidated multi-client view - to be discussed\n\r\n\n\r\nAll calculated metrics (CPA, ROAS, CVR% etc.) are formula-driven in the sheet. The automation only needs to supply the raw numbers. Do not build calculated metrics into the Make scenario.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTrigger and Schedule\n\r\nDaily trigger - runs once per day, preferably between midnight and 6am AEST\n\r\nPulls previous day's data plus refreshes last 3 days to handle Meta attribution window\n\r\nMust handle failures gracefully - if one client's API call fails, the scenario should continue for remaining clients and log the error\n\r\n\n\r\nMulti-Account Handling\n\r\nThis is the most technically important requirement. All 8 clients are on separate Meta Business Managers and separate Go High Level accounts. The builder must have a clear approach to handling this before starting work.\n\r\n\n\r\nNo single token covers all clients - each account requires its own API connection or token\n\r\nThe approach to managing multiple BM tokens (refresh, expiry, re-auth) must be documented and handed over\n\r\nGHL accounts are also separate instances - same requirement applies\n\r\nEach client should have their own independent Make scenario so failures are isolated per account.\n\r\nI will provide access credentials once approach is agreed\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I Am Not Looking For\n\r\nSomeone who will 'figure it out' on my budget - you should have done this before\n\r\nA Zapier builder who has dabbled in Make - Make-specific experience required\n\r\nSomeone who has only connected a single Meta ad account - multi-BM experience specifically\n\r\nA build that works once and breaks when a token expires with no documentation on how to fix it\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Experience\n\r\n\n - demonstrated, not claimed. Show me a live example or describe a comparable build in your application\n\r\nMeta Marketing API - specifically experience with multi-account / multi-BM setups and token management\n\r\nGo High Level API - experience pulling funnel/CRM data\n\r\nGoogle Sheets integration via Make\n\r\nExperience handling API authentication, token refresh, and error handling in Make scenarios\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus (not required for Phase 1)\n\r\nGoogle Sheets dashboard / formula build experience - if you can handle both the pipeline and the dashboard logic that is a bonus but not a requirement\n\r\n\n\r\nDeliverables\n\r\nThe following must be delivered and signed off before payment for each phase:\n\r\n\n\r\nWorking Make scenario(s) pulling daily data fro\nta and GHL into Google Sheets\n\r\nSheet populated with at least 2 weeks of historical data for the Phase 1 client on handover\n\r\nWritten documentation covering: how the scenario works, how to add a new client, how to handle token expiry and re-authentication for both Meta and GHL, and what to do when a scenario errors\n\r\nA 30-minute walkthrough call on handover (Zoom/Loom) explaining what was built and how to maintain it\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nDo not send a generic application. I will not respond to copy-paste cover letters.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application please answer the following specifically:\n\r\n\n\r\nHave you connected multiple separate Meta Business Managers in a single Make scenario? If yes, describe how you handled token management across accounts.\n\r\nHave you built a Make scenario that pulls data from Go High Level? If yes, what data were you pulling and what was the use case?\n\r\nDescribe how you would handle the Meta attribution window (conversions backdated 24-48 hours) in a daily data pull scenario.\n\r\nWhat happens in your scenarios when one API call fails mid-run? Walk me through your error handling approach.\n\r\nProvide either a link to a comparable live scenario (can be anonymised) or a brief description of the most similar project you have built.\n\r\n\n\r\nThese five questions are a screening filter. If you cannot answer questions 1 and 3 specifically, this project is not the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nBudget and Scope Note\n\r\nThis is scoped as a one-off build with a phased approach - Phase 1 is one client, Phase 2 is the remaining 7. I have additional automation projects beyond this one and am looking for someone I can work with on an ongoing basis if Phase 1 goes well.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease quote for Phase 1 (single client pipeline + documentation) and Phase 2 (scaling to 8 clients) separately in your application.

    "description": "\n                    I'm going to start this very differently than a typical job posting. :-)  And that is, we thought we had an excellent opportunity for BDRs in our company, but we were becoming uncertain because we have had 4 hires in a row who failed miserably in a row (not all from this website.)\n\r\n\n\r\nUntil we found a new BDR, one of the wives of an employee who managed a restaurant and no longer was employed said that she would help out and make some phone calls for us.  She has zero experience as a BDR, but she is smart, works a full day, is aggressive, and enjoys talking to people on the phone.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs of February 26 when I am writing this, she has set 23 meetings for the month so far, with our perfect Ideal Customer Profile (including about 50?ing Director, VP, Global ___, or Head of ____ - so this isn't just time-wasters who have nothing better to do than waste our time with a meeting.)  She's had over a 90% show-up rate so far.\n\r\n\n\r\nAgain, she is smart, and we're not going to expect everybody to start off that well.  But it is now obvious that it can be done, so especially if you have experience as a BDR and are willing to learn, participate, and work a full day, you should do extremely well here.  From a great deal of research and surveys, we believe that we are paying toward the very top of the pay scale for this kind of position, so we expect very strong candidates.\n\r\n\n\r\n===========\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, after that unusual start, I will tell you more about the position below. \n\r\n\n\r\nGenerally, we are looking for a full-time Business Development Representative (BDR) with at least 6 months of cold outreach experience. This experience is mandatory, because this job is not for everyone - trust me, I know because I did it for many years myself.  (While our current person does not have experience, her husband has worked with us for many years, so we waived the requirement.)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will supply the contacts, the scripts, and all of the technology and tools, so you won’t have to do any of that yourself.  Note that we do NOT want a \"robot\" who reads a script - the script is a framework for you to use at the beginning as you are learning, but the best thing you can possibly do is have a real conversation and ask questions, rather than reading a script in a monotone voice.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a young and fast-growing SaaS company, which is exciting and fun to be a part of. (But don’t worry, the company leadership team has built and grown similar companies in the past.) So, they know what it takes to do it right, and are also understanding and reasonable – they will not make ridiculous demands of you, or micro-manage you.\n\r\n\n\r\nFurther, the Chief Marketing Officer has worked with Filipino workers for over 10 years, and understands how things work in the Philippines pretty well. Also, the CEO and CMO together helped run a department of 14 BDRs for years, so they understand what is reasonable in terms of activity, achievement, etc. They are both very much biased toward quality over quantity.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe position itself will be to do both warm and cold outreach, using primarily phone and\n, but potentially LinkedIn as well. The industry we work with is the manufacturing industry, focusing specifically on the quality aspects – quality audits, inspections, etc.  \n\r\n\n\r\n90% of the companies we call on are in Europe and North and South America. There are very few prospects of ours in the Asia Pacific region.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs such, the working hours usually start with morning time in Eastern/Central Europe, and finish with Eastern and Central Time in the US (very few prospects are on Pacific or Mountain Time.) That means that there is a degree of flexibility in terms of hours, to help fit into your life. For example, you could start calling/emailing at 9:00am Central European Time, work several hours in the European region in general, and then work a few hours as it turns 8:00am Eastern Time in the US, and be done by 11:00am Eastern Time. (That’s just an example – you could start later and finish later, or start earlier and finish earlier, or whatever.)\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you can only work European hours or only work US hours, that could work as well, and we could just focus you on one region, so let's talk further about that.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will provide a HubSpot account, and an Internet-based phone like DialPad or AirCall or similar, a Microsoft 365 account, research tools like Lusha and FullEnrich, and are open to almost anything which makes you more effective.\n\r\n\n\r\nFinally, we need to have a very high level of English fluency for this position. A minimal accent is preferred, but that is not as important as being able to speak clearly, with correct singular/plural usage, correct verb tenses, and so on. \n\r\n\n\r\nGenerally, I am always extremely impressed with the English of the Filipinos that I work with, but this is extremely important because have a company based on offering a solution to the *quality* world, so everything we do must be high quality.\n\r\n\n\r\nI can provide you with a large amount of additional information about the position, but prefer to answer questions directly so that I don’t overwhelm you with too much information at once! Please, let me know what questions you have, and let’s see if we can build a great relationship together.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo move forward, please send back a reply telling me SPECIFICALLY why this position would be a good fit for you.  You can write a few sentences or a few paragraphs - I will read it all.  Finally, ensure that you have your CV/resume posted in your reply so that I can review it - thanks.\n\r\n\n\r\nSummary\n\r\n-------------\n\r\nPosition: Full-time\n\r\nHours: Generally to follow European and Eastern American time zones\n\r\nExperience required: 6 months of cold outreach MANDATORY\n\r\nEnglish level needed: Very high\n\r\n\n\r\nFinally, when you apply, it is ***essential*** that you use 3 Apply Points in your application.

    "description": "\n                    A growing, multi-location DTC apparel and retail company with both brick-and-mortar stores and a Shopify e-commerce operation is looking for a Director of E-Commerce / VP of Growth Execution to own the full e-commerce growth engine.\n\r\nThis is not a strategy-only role. This is a builder and integrator. The founder moves fast and generates ideas constantly: bundles, SKU changes, landing pages, offers, and new promotions. This person takes those ideas, builds them, launches them, tracks performance, and reports back with numbers. The founder should never touch execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone who has lived inside a DTC brand, scaled revenue on Shopify, and owned the full growth stack from storefront to Klaviyo. Pure paid media buyers, creative directors, developers, and corporate marketing managers are not the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\n 1. Idea-to-Execution Engine\n\r\n 2. Build landing pages and promotional pages directly in Shopify based on the founder’s direction.\n\r\n 3. Coordinate with the designer on creative assets needed for each initiative.\n\r\n 4. Set up offer logic, discount structures, pricing rules, bundle configurations, and collection architecture.\n\r\n 5. QA the full checkout experience across devices and browsers before anything goes live.\n\r\n 6. Push changes live on schedule, track performance from day one, and report back with clear data.\n\r\n 7. CRO Testing Velocity\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not about testing button colors. This is about meaningful experiments that move revenue.\n\r\n 1. Run 2 to 4 structured CRO tests per month across the storefront.\n\r\n 2. Rebuild hero product PDPs to maximize conversion and average order value.\n\r\n 3. Execute bundle experiments and offer framing tests.\n\r\n 4. Optimize checkout flow to reduce abandonment.\n\r\n 5. Analyze heatmaps and session recordings to identify friction points and drop-off areas.\n\r\n 6. Maintain a testing log with hypotheses, results, and learnings.\n\r\n 7. SKU Rationalization & Hero Product Focus\n\r\n\n\r\nRevenue scales when focus scales.\n\r\n 1. Pull 90-day velocity reports to identify top and bottom performers.\n\r\n 2. Kill the bottom 30% of underperforming SKUs. Push the top 10% with focused merchandising and dedicated landing pages.\n\r\n 3. Create hero collections and simplify navigation to reduce decision fatigue.\n\r\n 4. Provide regular catalog health reports with data-backed recommendations.\n\r\n 5. Lifecycle Profit Engine \n & SMS)\n\r\n\n\r\n and SMS are not afterthoughts. They are the margin expansion engine.\n\r\n 1. Rebuild and optimize Klaviyo flows: welcome series, abandoned cart, post-purchase, win-back, and VIP sequences.\n\r\n 2. Segment customers based on behavior, purchase history, and lifetime value.\n\r\n 3. Increase repeat purchase rate and raise LTV so the business can scale ad spend profitably.\n\r\n 4. Track and report on\n/SMS revenue attribution, open rates, click rates, and conversion by flow.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nMust-Have Qualifications\n\r\n 1. Experience scaling a DTC apparel or e-commerce brand, ideally from $3M–10M into $15M–30M+.\n\r\n 2. Deep Shopify fluency: Admin, theme customization (Liquid, HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Shopify Flow, checkout configuration, and catalog management.\n\r\n 3. Proven CRO experience with documented conversion improvements, A/B test outcomes, and revenue impact. Data required, not descriptions.\n\r\n 4. Working knowledge of Klaviyo: flow architecture, segmentation, and campaign management.\n\r\n 5. Strong analytics skills using Shopify Analytics, Google Analytics (GA4), and e-commerce dashboards.\n\r\n 6. Proficiency with Google Suite (Docs, Sheets, Drive, Gmail, Meet).\n\r\n 7. Experience using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude AI) for content, research, and workflow optimization.\n\r\n 8. Familiarity with Basecamp or similar project management tools.\n\r\n 9. Ability to work independently and deliver high-quality outputs without constant supervision.\n\r\n 10. Reliable internet and ability to overlap with U.S. Eastern Time zone.\n\r\n\n\r\nPreferred Qualifications\n\r\n 1. Experience with Shopify Plus and advanced checkout customization.\n\r\n 2. Knowledge of e-commerce SEO, site speed optimization, and technical SEO.\n\r\n 3. Background in paid advertising strategy (Google Ads, Meta Ads) with understanding of how ad traffic converts on Shopify.\n\r\n\n\r\nKEY TRAITS\n\r\n 1. Calm Executor: Steady under pressure. Channels the founder’s energy into organized, executable plans.\n\r\n 2. Process-Oriented: Builds systems and repeatable workflows. Brings structure without slowing things down.\n\r\n 3. Metrics-Obsessed: Every decision backed by data. Every test has a hypothesis. Every report has numbers.\n\r\n 4. Low Ego: The founder is the visionary. This person is the engine. Takes direction, executes with excellence, lets results speak.\n\r\n 5. High Follow-Through: When they say it’s done, it’s done. No loose ends, no excuses.\n\r\n 6.

    "description": "\n                    We are looking for a detail-obsessed Go High Level\n Manager to own the daily execution, scheduling, and automation of all\n campaigns inside Go High Level.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a critical role in our business. Our\n operation runs Monday-Friday, without exception, and accuracy matters.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will also be an executive assistant to the CEO of the company since this\n management will not take up your entire day. (About 3 hours per day for the\n management part.) \n\r\n\n\r\nSo, first, I will explain the\n manager role and then the executive assistant part. \n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Be Responsible For\n\r\n\n\r\n• Loading, scheduling, and managing daily\n campaigns inside Go High Level\n\r\n• Managing multiple segmentation buckets per\n (we\n 3x per day across 8 audience buckets per send)\n\r\n• Ensuring correct timing, tagging, logic, and automation flow for each campaign\n\r\n• Monitoring campaigns for errors, missed sends, or automation issues\n\r\n• Following detailed SOPs and checklists (we will train you)\n\r\n• Communicating clearly if something looks off or needs review\n\r\n• \n\r\nTime Commitment\n\r\n• Full Time when combining\n manager and executive assistant role \n\r\n• \n\r\nRequired Experience \n\r\n\n\r\n• Hands-on experience with Go High Level\n campaigns (we will train you on our system, but you still need GHL experience) \n\r\n• Strong understanding of campaigns, workflows, tags, and automation logic\n\r\n• Proven ability to manage high-volume\n operations\n\r\n• Exceptional attention to detail (this role is execution-heavy and precision matters)\n\r\n• \n\r\nIdeal Candidate\n\r\n• Organized, reliable, and calm under pressure\n\r\n• Comfortable following systems and checklists\n\r\n• Proactive communicator\n\r\n• Interested in becoming a long-term\n operations manager, not a short-term freelancer\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant\n\r\nThis is not a beginner role. Prior Go High Level\n experience is required. We will train you on our system, but you must already know High Level. Accuracy matters. One missed automation or incorrect send can cost our company thousands. If you thrive in execution-heavy roles where precision is critical, we want to hear from you.\n\r\n\n\r\nExecutive Assistant \n\r\n\n\r\nIn addition to managing the\n sends, you will be an executive assistant to the CEO. \n\r\n\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the\n manager will take you about 3 hours per day. Other duties you might have, may include: \n\r\n\n\r\nManaging slack messages\n\r\nManaging Linkedin\n\r\nAssisting with call scheduling \n\r\nCalendar management\n\r\nExpense reporting\n\r\nHelp project manage different teams across projects\n\r\nWriting Vendor Contracts\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you think you would be an excellent candidate for this job and you have an amazing attention to detail, here’s what you need to do right now: \n\r\n\n\r\nFirst, you need to submit your resume and a screen share video (using Loom or similar software) answering the questions: \n\r\n\n\r\n1. Why are you interested in the role? \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Why are you the right person for the job and what is your GHL experience? \n\r\n\n\r\n*Make sure to say Hi Jason, My name is XX and I like oranges. I need to know that the video is custom and not generic. If you do not mention oranges in your video, it will disqualify you.  \n\r\n\n\r\nMust submit the resume and video link to this\n address: \n \n\r\n\n\r\nMake sure in the subject line of the\n you put: UTAH - (your name) for GHL Job \n\r\n\n\r\nMust be willing to work same time zone as me.

Think Rent the Runway, but for guys who want to wear Rick Owens, Chrome Hearts, Amiri, and Margiela without dropping $2k+ on a single piece.\n\r\nWe’re pre-launch and building buzz on TikTok.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nYou’ll start by monitoring and replying to comments on fashion TikTok videos — inserting KingsCloset naturally into conversations where people are talking about designer clothes they want but can’t afford.\n\r\nOnce you’ve proven yourself, you’ll take on influencer outreach — finding and contacting creators in the elevated menswear and streetwear space to partner with us.\n\r\nThis role has room to grow into a larger social media and partnerships position.\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 1: Comment Engagement\n\r\n ? Monitor TikTok videos in the menswear/streetwear/designer fashion space\n\r\n ? Find comments from people who would benefit from KingsCloset\n\r\n ? Reply naturally and helpfully (not salesy, not robotic)\n\r\n ? Track your replies in a simple spreadsheet (video URL, comment, your reply)\n\r\n ? Report weekly: what’s working, what’s not, any trends you notice\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 2: Influencer Outreach (After Onboarding)\n\r\n ? Find TikTok and Instagram creators in elevated menswear, streetwear, and designer fashion\n\r\n ? Build lists of potential partners with contact info, follower count, engagement rate, and content style\n\r\n ? Send outreach DMs and\ns using templates we provide\n\r\n ? Track responses and manage conversations\n\r\n ? Help coordinate partnerships and content\n\r\nWe’re looking for creators who wear actual designer pieces — Rick Owens, Chrome Hearts, Kapital, Margiela, Raf Simons — not fast fashion styled to look expensive.\n\r\n\n\r\nExample Comments to Reply To\n\r\nSomeone says:\n\r\n“I wish I could afford this Rick Owens jacket”\n\r\nYou reply:\n\r\n“there’s actually a site where you can rent designer stuff for like 10% of retail — check out kingscloset”\n\r\nSomeone says:\n\r\n“need a fit for my friend’s wedding but can’t drop $1k”\n\r\nYou reply:\n\r\n“look into renting — kingscloset has designer pieces you can rent for way less than buying”\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’re Looking For\n\r\n ? You actually understand men’s fashion and streetwear culture\n\r\n ? You know the difference between Rick Owens and Zara, between archive Raf and H&M\n\r\n ? You can write casually and naturally (no corporate speak, no spam energy)\n\r\n ? You’re on TikTok and Instagram already and understand the culture\n\r\n ? You’re reliable, self-motivated, and can work independently\n\r\n ? You’re comfortable doing outreach and talking to people\n\r\n ? Bonus: Experience with influencer marketing, community management, or social media\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Need\n\r\n ? Your own TikTok account (aged, not brand new)\n\r\n ? Reliable internet\n\r\n ? Ability to work flexible hours (comments happen all day)\n\r\n ? Basic spreadsheet skills (Google Sheets)\n\r\n ? Good written English\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply\n\r\nSend me:\n\r\n 1. A short intro about yourself and why this role interests you\n\r\n 2. Your TikTok and/or Instagram handle (so I can see what content you engage with)\n\r\n 3. 3 example replies you would leave on fashion TikTok comments (make them up, show me your voice)\n\r\n 4. Name 2 TikTok or Instagram creators you think would be a good fit for KingsCloset and why\n\r\n 5. Your hourly rate expectation\n\r\n 6. How many hours/week you’re available\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Points\n\r\n ? You already follow accounts \n \n \n\r\n ? You know what Grailed, SSENSE, Farfetch, and END are\n\r\n ? You’ve bought or sold archive/designer pieces before\n\r\n ? You’ve done influencer outreach or creator partnerships before\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is perfect for someone who loves fashion, is chronically online, and wants to grow with an early-stage startup.\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you.

You will be a hybrid marketer capable of driving performance across both\n\r\nGoogle Ads (SEM) and Meta Ads \n/Instagram).\n\r\n\n\r\nIn this role, you will partner closely with an Account Manager. While the Account Manager holds the primary client relationship, you will be the technical voice in the room - executing the work, analysing the data, and joining calls to explain how we are achieving results.\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Responsibilities\n\r\n1. Google Ads (SEM) Execution\n\r\n- Campaign Management: Set up and configure search campaigns with granular control. You own the day-to-day levers: bids, budgets, and keywords\n\r\n- Optimisation: Manage bidding strategies independently to hit ROAS/CPA targets\n\r\n- Search Quality: Perform deep keyword mining, negative keyword research, and Search Query Report (SQR) analysis\n\r\n- Ad Copy: Write compelling headlines and descriptions; implement ad extensions (Sitelinks, Callouts) that align with the strategy set by the Account Manager\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Meta Ads (Social) Execution\n\r\n- Build & Launch: Build robust campaign structures from scratch, selecting objectives (Sales, Leads, Traffic) that align with the broader marketing goals\n\r\n- Audience Strategy: Execute deep audience research, creating custom audiences, lookalikes, and interest stacks\n\r\n- Creative Feedback: Analyse creative performance and provide specific, data-backed feedback to the design team (e.g., \"The video hook is working, but the CTA needs to change\")\n\r\n- Testing: Manage rigorous A/B testing of creatives and audiences to drive incremental lift\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Analytics & Diagnostics (No Implementation Required)\n\r\n- Diagnosis over Deployment: You are not expected to write code or implement tags. However, you must be able to diagnose issues. You should be able to look at an account and flag if the Pixel isn't firing correctly or if GA4 data looks discrepant\n\r\n- Data Analysis: Use GA4 and platform data to uncover trends. You will answer the question \"Why is performance up/down?\" using data, not just intuition\n\r\n- Reporting: Compile data for weekly and monthly reports, providing the technical commentary that the Account Manager will present to the client\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Client Support & Communication\n\r\n- Technical Expert: You will join client calls as the Subject Matter Expert. While the Account Manager leads the meeting, you will speak to the technical performance, campaign logic, and optimisation details\n\r\n- Response Support: Assist the Account Manager by drafting technical answers to complex client queries regarding attribution, bidding logic, or platform changes\n\r\n\n\r\nDay-to-Day Tasks\n\r\nBased on our internal task matrix, your focus will be on \"High\" and \"Medium\" brainpower tasks:\n\r\n- Strategic Work: Competitor research, Funnel Strategy planning, and Targeting Strategy\n\r\n- Optimisation: Bid strategy management, Quality Score analysis, and Budget pacing\n\r\n- Creative Strategy: Briefing ad creative variations and writing ad copy\n\r\n- Troubleshooting: Identifying 404s in ads or broken tracking links and flagging them for the dev team\n\r\n\n\r\n** Requirements & Proficiency **\n\r\n- Experience: 3-5+ years managing both Google Ads and Paid Social budgets\n\r\n- Platform Mastery: Expert-level knowledge of Google Ads Manager, Google Ads Editor, and Meta Ads Manager\n\r\n- Analytical Capability: Strong proficiency in reading GA4 and using it to cross-reference platform data. (Coding/GTM Implementation skills are not required, but the ability to identify a broken setup is).\n\r\n- Communication: Articulate and clear. You can explain complex bidding algorithms to a non-technical client when called upon\n\r\n- Autonomy: You can manage your own workload and task list without the Account Manager needing to micromanage your daily schedule\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Points (Optional but Awesome)\n\r\n- Automation: The ability to build automations to handle repetitive tasks would be a massive advantage\n\r\n- Examples: Using Zapier/Make to connect lead forms to spreadsheets, writing Google Ads Scripts to automate budget pacing or negative keyword checks, or using AI tools to streamline reporting workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\n** Ideal Candidate Profile **\n\r\nYou are a \"Doer\" who loves being inside the ad platforms. You prefer focusing on the craft of media buying - tweaking bids, testing audiences, and analysing results-rather than managing client contracts or handling high-level crisis management. You want to be the trusted technical partner to a strong Account Manager.                ",

Our top performers earn meaningful bonuses based on closed contracts and consistent production.\n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule\n\r\nFull-time, Monday to Friday\n\r\n9:00 AM – 6:00 PM CST\n\r\nRemote position, work from your own secure setup\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Be Doing\n\r\n- Engage with homeowners (seller leads), build authentic rapport, and manage conversations with professionalism\n\r\n- Follow a proven acquisitions script while sounding natural and confident\n\r\n- Ask strong follow-up questions to uncover seller motivation and property condition\n\r\n- Make verbal offers, negotiate price and terms, and walk sellers through agreements using DocuSign\n\r\n- Handle objections effectively and push deals forward toward signed contracts\n\r\n- Maintain organized notes, offers, and seller updates in our CRM\n\r\n- Collaborate closely with the acquisitions team and leadership\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat It Takes to Succeed Here\n\r\n- Relentless Follow-Up: Sellers don’t always respond the first time — or the second. You know how to stay persistent with calls, texts, and follow-ups until you get an answer. Nothing slips through the cracks on your watch.\n\r\n- Extreme Attention to Detail: Every call, every note, every update gets logged correctly in the CRM. You don’t miss details, and you take pride in keeping your pipeline organized. If you’ve ever been called meticulous or “on top of everything,” this is where you’ll shine.\n\r\n- Closer’s Mentality: You’re not just reading a script — you know how to listen, build rapport, and guide sellers toward a decision. You thrive on negotiation, handle objections with confidence, and create win-win agreements that get signed.\n\r\n- Driven by Results: You measure success by contracts closed. You hold yourself to high standards and push to hit — and exceed — your targets consistently. You’re motivated by performance and driven by the satisfaction of closing successful deals.\n\r\n- Resilient Problem-Solver: Whether it’s a tough seller, a pricing objection, or a complicated situation, you don’t freeze — you find solutions and move the deal forward. Challenges are part of the role, and you thrive in solving them under pressure.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n- Minimum 2+ years of experience in real estate acquisitions or seller negotiations\n\r\n- Proven track record of closing real estate deals and securing signed contracts\n\r\n- Excellent English communication skills (spoken and written)\n\r\n- Confidence and professionalism on the phone; ability to build trust and rapport quickly\n\r\n- Familiarity with real estate terms like ARV, repairs, inspection, contingencies, etc.\n\r\n- Strong work ethic, coachability, and ability to follow scripts while sounding natural\n\r\n- Proficiency with CRMs and outbound dialers\n\r\n- Reliable high-speed internet, updated computer, and a quiet workspace\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’re Looking For\n\r\n- A confident, friendly, and persuasive communicator who thrives on results\n\r\n- Someone who is organized, detail-oriented, and relentless in follow-up\n\r\n- A professional with the drive to close contracts and grow with a fast-moving team\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Join Us?\n\r\n- Competitive pay with structured bonuses\n\r\n- Real opportunities for growth in a professional investment company\n\r\n- Work remotely with a team that supports your success\n\r\n- A chance to close real deals, make a real impact, and develop long-term career skills in acquisitions\n\r\n\n\r\nAt Price Real Estate Investments, acquisitions is the heartbeat of our business. You’ll be in the front seat, driving growth and learning the strategies that power real deals across multiple U.S. markets.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply: (Read Carefully – Incomplete Applications Will Be Ignored)\n\r\n-\n us at: \n\r\n- Subject line: Real Estate Acquisitions Application – OJPH\n\r\n- Attach your resume with relevant real estate or sales experience\n\r\n- Include a 1–2 minute audio or video introduction about yourself and experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly applicants who follow all instructions will be considered.

We create high-quality educational and inspirational content for Instagram Reels,\n Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and podcast platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur audience is primarily women ages 35–65 who are interested in herbalism, nature, healing, and living in rhythm with the earth. We are looking for a skilled and reliable video editor who can grow with us long-term.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? What You’ll Be Editing\n\r\n\n\r\nEach month you will edit approximately 30 short-form vertical videos and repurpose each video across all major short-form platforms. You will also edit podcast clips for social media and occasionally assist with longer YouTube videos.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will provide MP4 video files, C-Log footage that requires color correction and grading, separate high-quality audio files, brand colors and fonts, and clear creative direction.\n\r\n\n\r\n?? Your Core Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role requires technical skill. You must be comfortable syncing separate audio to video footage, color correcting and grading C-Log footage, and creating or applying LUTs to maintain a consistent brand look. You will edit engaging 15–90 second vertical videos, cut longer footage into strong hook-driven clips, add accurate and well-timed captions, include simple text overlays and light motion graphics, add background music when appropriate, export properly formatted versions for each platform, and organize files clearly in folders.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Ideal Candidate\n\r\n\n\r\nYou have experience editing professional camera footage, not only phone edits. You understand C-Log and basic color correction, can sync external audio properly, and understand short-form pacing and retention. You have strong English skills for captions, are detail-oriented and organized, and communicate clearly while meeting deadlines.\n\r\n\n\r\nIt is a bonus if you have edited instagram, podcast, or\n clips before, worked with educational or wellness brands, or understand current Instagram and TikTok hook trends.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Work Structure\n\r\n\n\r\nThis position is 35 hours per month with a flexible schedule. We batch film content and send footage to you once to twice per month. This is a long-term opportunity with potential for increased hours as the school grows.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Compensation\n\r\n\n\r\n$8 per hour, paid monthly, with opportunity for long-term growth.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? How to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include a short introduction about yourself, links to 3–5 short-form videos you have edited, your experience with C-Log and color grading, what editing software you use, your internet speed, and the word Video Editor in your subject line. Applications without the keyword will not be reviewed.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are building a high-quality, mission-driven brand and are looking for someone who takes pride in their work and wants to grow with us ???? I would love to work with innovative creators that can stay with the brand tone but create high impact through editing.                ",
