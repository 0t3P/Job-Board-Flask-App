Don’t worry about software costs. Nothing will come out of your pocket.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow it works is pretty straightforward. We give you a 1–3 minute UGC or VSL script, and you edit the full video. On top of that, we’ll usually ask for 2 hook variations, which is basically just the first ~10 seconds tweaked, so it’s not much extra work.\n\r\n\n\r\nJust to be clear, you wouldn’t be joining the team immediately. We like to try editors out first with a couple paid test batches. You’ll be paid the same as you would be if you were fully on the team for these trials.\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter that stage, our goal is to keep editors around long term. If your edits perform well, we bump pay and add bonuses when ads scale. The goal is for you to feel like part of the team, not just someone cranking out random gigs. We move fast and keep things simple.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this sounds like something you’d be down for, apply with a short intro and a few examples of relevant edits. We’d love to see what you can do.                ",

You'll respond to their questions, help them find the right host, and make sure conversations between travelers and hosts go smoothly.\n\r\nWhen something goes wrong during a trip (a cancellation, a misunderstanding, a delayed driver), you're the person who steps in to coordinate a solution.\n\r\n2.

You'll use Canva for design and help us turn followers into actual bookings.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We're Looking For\n\r\nThis role is right for you if:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou've done customer support or community management before (Airbnb, travel, or hospitality experience is a big plus — but not required)\n\r\nYour written English is strong enough that a native speaker wouldn't notice a difference\n\r\nYou're comfortable juggling WhatsApp,\n, and Instagram at the same time without losing track of conversations\n\r\nYou know your way around Canva and Instagram (Reels, Stories, engagement strategies)\n\r\nYou can handle a frustrated traveler with patience and warmth — no scripts, just genuine problem-solving\n\r\nYou have reliable internet (minimum 20 Mbps) and a backup power solution for brownouts\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\nA stable, long-term role with a growing company (we've been around since 2016)\n\r\nYou'll learn about destinations most VAs never get to work with\n\r\nRoom to grow — if you're great, there's more responsibility and better pay ahead\n\r\nA founder who respects your time and communicates clearly\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply — Read This Carefully\n\r\nWe receive hundreds of applications. To make sure yours gets read, please do the following:\n\r\nStep 1: Record a short video (2–3 minutes max) using Loom, your phone, or any screen recorder. In the video:\n\r\n\n\r\nIntroduce yourself briefly\n\r\nPick ONE of these countries: Mongolia, Uzbekistan, or Georgia. Tell us one thing about that country that would make a traveler want to visit. (You can look it up — we just want to see how you communicate, not test your geography.)\n\r\nDescribe a time you dealt with a difficult customer or a stressful situation at work. What happened and what did you do?\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 2: Share the video link in your application.\n\r\nStep 3: In your cover letter, start with this sentence: \"My favorite underrated travel destination is [your answer].\"\n\r\nApplications without a video will not be reviewed. We've learned from experience that written answers alone don't tell us what we need to know.                ",

We now need a sharp, hands-on Content Manager to take full ownership of this system — running it day to day, maintaining quality standards, managing client feedback loops, and continuously improving our AI tools and workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a \"learn AI from scratch\" role. You should already be comfortable working with AI tools like Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, and visual platforms like Nano Banana.

My channel leans heavily into aesthetic pacing, character development, and emotionally immersive edits. Episodes typically range between 45–90 minutes and are structured more like episodic television than standard gameplay videos, with a mixture of live gameplay segments and short, scripted cinematic scenes.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with The Sims 4 is not required. What matters most is your ability to shape narrative arcs, refine pacing, integrate music thoughtfully, and produce polished long-form content at a high standard on a weekly basis.\n\r\nThis role begins at 8 hours per week and is intended to be long term. I am not looking for freelance project-based work, but rather someone interested in growing in this position over time, with room for expanded responsibilities as the channel continues to develop.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Skills:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience editing long-form content \n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong proficiency in video editing software such as: Adobe Premiere Pro, CapCut, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro etc.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong understanding of pacing, emotional beats, and narrative cohesion\n\r\n\n\r\n- Ability to integrate music and sound design intentionally\n\r\n\n\r\n- Ability to deliver videos to a high standard within assigned deadlines\n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong communication and reliability\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nRole Structure & Compensation:\n\r\n\n\r\n- This role begins at 8 hours per week focused exclusively on long-form editing.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Compensation ranges from $5–$7USD per hour, depending on experience, portfolio strength, and demonstrated ability to execute cinematic long-form content.\n\r\n\n\r\n- As the channel grows, there is opportunity for expanded hours and increased responsibility over time. I value long-term collaboration and invest in editors who consistently deliver strong work and communicate well.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Please send an e-mail to \n with the subject line:\n\r\n[Your Name] – Long Form Cinematic Video Editor – C7\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease Include:\n\r\n\n\r\n- A portfolio showcasing long-form editing work (applications without a portfolio will not be considered)\n\r\n\n\r\n- A brief note explaining why romantic, cinematic storytelling interests you\n\r\n\n\r\n- Your proficiency with editing software \n\r\n\n\r\n- Your current weekly availability (in hours)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Your salary expectations (USD hourly rate)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Your availability to interview within the next three days\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a collaborative role for someone who takes pride in refined storytelling and wants to be part of building something intentionally from the ground up.
