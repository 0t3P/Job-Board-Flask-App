    "description": "\n                    About the role: We're not just another remote job. We're a mission-driven health technology company helping thousands of older Americans reduce chronic pain and avoid unnecessary medications. We're growing fast, and we need someone exceptionally detail-oriented to handle customer service and content tasks using AI tools.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur customers are older adults (50+) who are often skeptical, technically challenged, and need compassionate, clear communication. You'll be their main point of contact.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is 60% customer service, 40% content work.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you'll actually be doing:\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomer Service (Primary Focus - 60% of time):\n\r\n- Respond to 20-30 customer inquiries daily \n & chat) in our ticketing system\n\r\n- Use Claude AI to draft responses, then critically review and personalize them\n\r\n- Adapt our\n templates (makros) to each customer's specific situation\n\r\n- Read full conversation history before responding, context is everything\n\r\n- Handle returns, warranty cases, medical questions following our protocols\n\r\n- Know when to escalate vs. handle independently\n\r\n\n\r\nContent & Marketing (40% of time):\n\r\n- Write science-backed blog posts with AI assistance (you prompt, proofread, fact-check, optimize)\n\r\n- Create social media content with Canva (using our templates)\n\r\n- Schedule posts and engage with our audience\n\r\n- Reach out to health & wellness influencers for partnerships (80% automated already)\n\r\n\n\r\nCritical requirements (no exceptions):\n\r\n- 5+ years of customer service experience (preferably in health, wellness, or medical devices)\n\r\n- Near-native English (our customers are American seniors)\n\r\n- Proven experience using AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.). You should already be using AI in your current work\n\r\n- Experience with project management tools (ClickUp, Asana, Trello etc)\n\r\n- Obsessive attention to detail. You catch mistakes others miss\n\r\n- Fast learner who takes notes and doesn't repeat mistakes\n\r\n- Excellent internet connection and professional workspace\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll struggle in this role if you:\n\r\n- Copy-paste AI responses without critical thinking\n\r\n- Don't read full context before responding\n\r\n- Tend to make the same mistake over and over again\n\r\n- Need constant supervision\n\r\n- Work multiple jobs and can't focus\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat makes someone successful here:\n\r\n- Read full context before responding (you're thorough, not rushed)\n\r\n- Customize templates thoughtfully (not copy-paste)\n\r\n- Think critically about whether your responses make sense\n\r\n- Take pride in helping people solve real problems\n\r\n- Want to build something, not just clock hours\n\r\n- See feedback as a gift, not criticism\n\r\n- You work independently but know when to ask for help\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat makes this opportunity different:\n\r\n- Career growth path: We're hiring for a Customer Service Specialist today, but we're building toward a Customer Service Team Lead role. As we scale, the right person will lead our support team, train new hires, and shape our customer experience strategy. \n\r\n- Competitive compensation: $1,000 - $1,200/month USD for full-time (40 hours/week) with true growth potential.\n\r\n- Paid time off: 15 days paid annual leave (includes public holidays, you choose when to take them).\n\r\n- Professional development: Access to courses, AI tools, and direct mentorship from our founder. We invest in people who invest in themselves.\n\r\n- Flexible schedule (must overlap at least 3 hours with Thailand time)\n\r\n- Process-driven company with comprehensive training with documentation, videos, and daily feedback\n\r\n- Cutting-edge tools: You'll work with the latest AI technology. This isn't data entry, you're learning skills that will be valuable for years to come.\n\r\n- Meaningful work: Our customers are grandparents who want to play with their grandkids without pain, veterans managing injuries, people avoiding opioids. Your work directly improves lives.\n\r\n- Stability with a startup: We're profitable, growing steadily, and been in business for 3 years. You get startup opportunity without the risk.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur hiring process:\n\r\n1) Video application (3-5 min) - see questions below\n\r\n2) Video interview (30 min) - we'll get to know you, answer your questions & test your thinking\n\r\n3) Paid trial task (4 hours, $50) - customer service scenarios to filter for skills. Tests attention to detail, AI usage, customer service judgment\n\r\n4) Trial week (20 hours, $160) - Work with real tickets. We will filter for learning ability & work ethic.\n\r\n5) Probation month ($1,000) - for both of us to understand whether we're a good fit\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a high bar. We've had candidates with 10+ years of experience not work out because they lacked attention to detail and didn't learn from mistakes. If you're not someone who naturally catches details and learns quickly, this isn't the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, create a video (Use Loom, Dubb or similar tools) answering these questions:\n\r\n1) Customer service experience: Tell me about your experience (years, industry etc) and mention one of the most challenging tickets you worked on and how you resolved it.\n\r\n2) AI usage: How do you currently use AI in your work? Be specific with tools and tasks\n\r\n3) Why you: Let us know why you think we should choose you over other candidates\n\r\n\n\r\nYour video should be max 5 minutes. Applications without video will be automatically rejected.                ",

    "description": "\n                    ## Job Title\n\r\n\n\r\nPersonal Virtual Assistant -- Organized, Proactive, AI-Friendly\n\r\n\n\r\n## Job Description\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm a tech entrepreneur running multiple projects (a software company, investments, and a DJ side business). I'm looking for a sharp, organized virtual assistant to be my right hand on the operations side of things.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't a typical VA role. **You'll essentially be my number two** -- helping me run things, not just checking off tasks. I need someone who takes ownership, builds systems, thinks strategically, and holds me accountable. If I'm dragging my feet on something, I expect you to follow up and push me to get it done. If you're someone who waits quietly for the next task, this isn't the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n### What You'll Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Document & file organization** -- Organizing Google Drive, cloud storage, and local files. Building folder structures and naming conventions. Proactively thinking about ways to improve our efficiency and readiness for taxes and other document-heavy events -- not just organizing once, but creating systems that stay organized.\n\r\n- **Personal admin & gifting** -- Researching and ordering gifts for friends, family, and business contacts. Handling purchases and managing recurring personal tasks that keep falling through the cracks.\n\r\n- **Travel booking & points optimization** -- Booking travel, tracking my points balances across programs, and recommending the best way to use them for each trip. Proactively flagging deals and redemption opportunities.\n\r\n- **Calendar & scheduling** -- Coordinating meetings, blocking focus time, keeping me on track.\n\r\n- **Sales operations & client support** -- I handle the selling, but you help close the loop. Sending out DocuSigns, following up with clients, preparing contracts and consulting agreements, and handling the admin side of closing deals.\n\r\n- **Copywriting** -- Drafting copy for consulting proposals, client-facing\ns, social media posts, and other communications as needed.\n\r\n- **Product & market research** -- Researching competitors, market positioning, and user needs for new applications I'm building. You'll be my thought partner on this, not just a data gatherer.\n\r\n- **AI tools & marketing research** -- Staying on top of new AI tools and marketing strategies. Identifying what we should be using and how to implement them.\n\r\n- **Content summarization** -- Summarizing articles, reports, and content I haven't had time to read. We'll build an AI-assisted workflow for this together.\n\r\n\n\r\n### What Makes You Stand Out\n\r\n\n\r\n**You're a systematizer.** The first time you do something, you document it. You create SOPs, checklists, and templates so it never has to be figured out twice. You think in systems, not one-off tasks.\n\r\n\n\r\n**You're proactive and direct.** You don't wait to be told what to do next. You see what needs doing and you flag it. You're comfortable being frank with me -- if something is falling behind, you say so.\n\r\n\n\r\n**You're organized and trustworthy.** You manage details without dropping balls. You handle sensitive information (finances, personal accounts) with discretion.\n\r\n\n\r\n**You can think independently.** When I give you a goal, you figure out the steps. You don't need every decision made for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n### Required Skills\n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong English communication (written and verbal)\n\r\n- Google Workspace (Drive, Docs, Sheets, Calendar)\n\r\n- Notion (or similar project management/knowledge base tools)\n\r\n- Comfortable with video calls and async communication\n\r\n\n\r\n### Nice to Have\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience with AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) -- I'm happy to teach this if you're a fast learner\n\r\n- Ability to set up Slack integrations and automations\n\r\n- Experience with travel booking and points/miles optimization\n\r\n- Previous experience as a personal or executive assistant\n\r\n- Bookkeeping or basic financial organization experience\n\r\n\n\r\n### Schedule & Compensation\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Starting at 10 hours/week** with the opportunity to scale to full-time as we build trust and the workload grows\n\r\n- **$300/month retainer** to start\n\r\n- Flexible hours -- I care about output, not when you're online\n\r\n- Long-term role -- I'm looking for someone to grow with, not a short-term hire\n\r\n\n\r\n### How to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include in your application:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. A brief intro about yourself and your experience as a VA\n\r\n2. Tell me about a time you created a system or process that made your client's life easier\n\r\n3. What AI tools do you currently use, if any? (It's okay if the answer is none -- I value honesty over a padded resume)\n\r\n4. Your availability and preferred working hours\n\r\n\n\r\nI'll be doing a 30-minute video interview with shortlisted candidates, followed by a small paid test task so we can both see if the fit is right.

Our brands, Plastair, DeeVa, and PlastairFyre, are built on differentiated products, strong margins, and when appropriate, utility patents or design patents. We manufacture in Canada, or source electronics overseas, then protect and position them properly.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have dominated brick and mortar retail for decades. Now we are building a serious digital revenue engine. Our online presence is underdeveloped relative to our product strength, and we want fast, measurable improvement without the owner being the day to day operator.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a full time leadership role for a true owner operator. You will own digital revenue results across Amazon Seller, Shopify DTC, and additional marketplaces including Walmart, Wayfair, and digital B2B platforms such as Faire and Grainger.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a VA role, not a coordinator role, not a task manager role. Your job is to build the machine, lead people, make decisions, and remove work from ownership’s plate.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will manage and leverage our existing Amazon operations resource, Arnel, and you will rebuild our creative production function to improve speed, accuracy, and quality.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\r\n\n\r\nWithin 60 to 90 days, ownership should experience a real reduction in day to day decisions, fewer errors, faster execution, clearer reporting, and visible \nntum across listings, creative, ads, and channel expansion.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you do not remove work from the

and Wayfair with correct catalog setup, content requirements, compliance, and fulfillment workflows\n\r\n\n\r\nPlan and execute international Amazon expansion when unit economics and operational readiness support it\n\r\n\n\r\nDigital B2B marketplaces\n\r\n\n\r\nOwn digital B2B marketplace performance including platforms such as Faire and Grainger\n\r\n\n\r\nEnsure pricing, content, and inventory strategy align with brand positioning and avoid channel conflict\n\r\n\n\r\nCoordinate onboarding, catalog setup, and ongoing optimization for digital wholesale platforms\n\r\n\n\r\nPaid media strategy and performance\n\r\n\n\r\nOwn paid media strategy and budget allocation across Amazon ads and Meta, plus other channels as appropriate\n\r\n\n\r\nYou may execute ads yourself or manage a specialist, but you are accountable for outcomes\n\r\n\n\r\nBuild repeatable testing systems for keywords, creative, offers, and landing pages, not random changes\n\r\n\n\r\nCreative, content, and

We are not hiring in volume. We are hiring one person we can grow with as we scale to 80–100 properties. If you perform well and stay with us, this role will naturally grow into a higher position when we expand.\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant Context (Read This Carefully)\n\r\nWe have been hiring and letting people go over the last 6 months. Not because of pay. Not because of workload. But because we are very selective and have not yet found the right long-term fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role requires:\n\r\n- Strong communication\n\r\n- Good judgment\n\r\n- Ownership\n\r\n- Reliability under pressure\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’re confident in your ability, this is a rare opportunity to join early and grow with the company.

This Role Is For One Type of Person Only\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are:\n\r\n- Fluent in spoken and written English\n\r\n- Comfortable speaking on the phone with:\n\r\n- Guests\n\r\n- Vendors\n\r\n- Homeowners\n\r\n- Calm, logical, and clear under pressure\n\r\n- Able to manage multiple issues at once\n\r\n- A strong problem solver\n\r\n- Someone who finishes what they start\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are not:\n\r\n- A task-only VA\n\r\n- Someone who avoids calls\n\r\n- Someone who needs constant direction\n\r\n- Someone who panics under stress\n\r\n- Someone who relies on AI to communicate\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunication Expectations (Very Important)\n\r\nYou should expect:\n\r\n- 5–20 phone calls per day\n\r\n\n\r\nDaily coordination with:\n\r\n- Cleaning teams\n\r\n- Maintenance vendors\n\r\n- Internal staff\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are not confident speaking English on calls, do not apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Actually Be Doing: This is not a customer service role.\n\r\nApproximate breakdown:\n\r\n- 10% Guest communication\n\r\n- 5% Cleaning reminders\n\r\n- 5% Ordering supplies\n\r\n- 80% Operations, coordination, and problem-solving\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will function as:\n\r\n- A project manager\n\r\n- A communicator between teams\n\r\n- A problem-solver when things go wrong\n\r\n- A key operations support role\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Environment\n\r\n- Small, fast-moving startup\n\r\n- High accountability\n\r\n- Clear expectations\n\r\n- Real responsibility\n\r\n- Direct communication with leadership\n\r\n- Opportunity to grow as the company scales\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Benefits\n\r\n- Up to $8.00 USD/hour (based on performance)\n\r\n- 10 days paid time off per year\n\r\n- 2 days off per week\n\r\n- Long-term role with growth potential\n\r\n- Promotion opportunity as we scale to 80–100 properties\n\r\n\n\r\nFinal Note: We are not looking to hire quickly. We are looking to hire correctly. If you believe your experience, communication skills, and work ethic make you a strong fit — apply. If you are unsure, this role is not for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you believe you are a strong fit and meet all of the requirements above, apply using the link below.\n\r\nhttps://api.leadconnectorhq.com/widget/form/u5D8ACly2LEOjvjiC88x\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant:\n\r\nApplications that are dis-honest, incomplete, generic, or clearly copy-pasted will be ignored. We are only moving forward with candidates who demonstrate strong communication, attention to detail, and professionalism.

    "description": "\n                    About Us\n\r\nWe are a U.S.-based AI video production company located in Rhode Island. We serve clients in real estate, insurance, brand storytelling, and character-driven animation. We've been in video production since 2019 and have worked with high-profile clients across multiple industries.\n\r\nThis is a permanent, salaried position with daily work. We have long-term client partnerships that guarantee consistent production year-round. We are building a team — not cycling through freelancers.\n\r\nAbout the salary range: We listed a wide range because we're open to different experience levels. If you're a strong traditional editor who's eager to grow into AI video, we'll start you at a fair rate and invest in your development. If you're already producing broadcast-quality AI video and can hit the ground running, we'll pay accordingly — up to $3,500/month for the right person. We believe in paying well for excellent work.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Job Is Different\n\r\nWe provide ALL AI tools and software subscriptions. You will not need to pay for any AI video platforms out of pocket. Once you're part of the team, we give you full access to the tools you need — including platforms like Sora, VEO, Kling, Runway, Pika, HeyGen, and others as needed. We also provide Adobe Creative Cloud if required.\n\r\nWe know these tools are expensive. We invest in our team so you can focus on doing great work instead of worrying about subscription costs.\n\r\nWhat else we offer:\n\r\n\n\r\nMonthly salary starting at $500/month for promising candidates, scaling up to $3,500/month for top performers — we pay for results and commitment, not just hours\n\r\nSalary paid consistently (weekly during your first 2 months, then bi-monthly)\n\r\n13th month bonus in December\n\r\nAll AI tool subscriptions and software covered by us\n\r\nTraining on our specific workflows and client standards\n\r\nReal career growth — we promote from within and reward strong performers with raises and leadership opportunities\n\r\nPayment via Wise, PayPal, or your preferred method\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\nYour day-to-day work will include:\n\r\n\n\r\nCreating AI-generated video content using multiple platforms — selecting the right tool for each creative challenge\n\r\nBuilding and animating realistic digital avatars with accurate lip sync, natural facial expressions, and believable body language\n\r\nEditing and polishing final videos in Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, or DaVinci Resolve — including transitions, motion graphics, captions, color correction, and audio mixing\n\r\nTranslating scripts and client briefs into visual content across corporate, cinematic, and commercial styles\n\r\nQuality-checking every deliverable for consistency in character appearance, lighting, pacing, and overall professional standard\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We're Looking For\n\r\nWe need someone who treats AI as a creative tool, not a shortcut. The right person has three qualities:\n\r\n1. High standards for quality. You notice artifacts, background warping, unnatural blinking, and lip sync issues before anyone else. Color correction and lighting continuity are part of your process from the start — not finishing touches.\n\r\n2. Understanding of AI video tools. You don't need to own subscriptions to every platform, but you should understand what different AI video tools can do and how they compare. If you've used free tiers, watched breakdowns, experimented during trials, or studied these tools closely — that counts. We will give you full access once you're on the team.\n\r\n3. Strong post-production skills. Creating the AI clip is only half the job. Editing, pacing, sound design, compositing, and storytelling are the other half. You should be comfortable and confident in Premiere Pro, After Effects, or DaVinci Resolve.\n\r\n\n\r\nTechnical Requirements\n\r\n\n\r\nHands-on experience or demonstrated knowledge of 2 or more AI video platforms (HeyGen, Kling, VEO, Runway, Midjourney, Pika, Sora, etc.)\n\r\nAdvanced proficiency in Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects (or DaVinci Resolve)\n\r\nPortfolio showing strong visual storytelling, pacing, and compositional sense\n\r\nClear English communication — you'll interpret creative briefs and collaborate directly with our team\n\r\nReliable internet connection and a computer capable of running video editing software smoothly\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply — Please Read Carefully\n\r\nWe review every application personally. To help us find the right person, please include the following in your application:\n\r\n1. Show us your work. Share 2-3 video samples. We are looking for:\n\r\n\n\r\nAI-generated video work if you have it (even free-tier or watermarked samples are fine — we understand tool access is limited)\n\r\nPolished post-production work (editing, color, motion graphics, sound design)\n\r\nAvatar-focused or character-driven examples will put you at the top of the list\n\r\nIf you don't have AI video samples, show us your strongest traditional editing work AND explain which AI video tools you've studied or experimented with and what you know about their strengths and limitations\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Tell us why this role fits you. In a few sentences (not a copy-paste cover letter), explain what about this position matches where you are in your career and why you're looking for something permanent.\n\r\n3. Include the word \"Storyboard\" at the beginning of your application so we know you read the full post.\n\r\nImportant: Applications without any work samples will not be reviewed. You don't need a perfect portfolio — but we need to see evidence of your skills and your eye for quality.                ",

A strong understanding of English and social media content is crucial here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be working hand in hand with me on an extremely viral social media page and there is room for bonuses if deadlines are met and the content performs well!\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\n- Attention to detail\n\r\n- STRONG English\n\r\n- Strong internet connection\n\r\n- Previous experience with Capcut / TikTok / Instagram\n\r\n- Good working with a team\n\r\n- Ability to learn and take constructive feedback\n\r\n- Availability to work 2-3h a day (with potential for more and increased salary)\n\r\n- Able to work 5-6 days per week (can take days off whenever as long as mostly consistent)\n\r\n- Can take payments through Wise\n\r\n- PH or similar time zone\n\r\n\n\r\n$300/month + bonuses for 2-3h a day MAX and potential full time work in the future with a salary increase.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please complete the recreate assignment below so I can see your skills (1h max)\n\r\n\n\r\nBelow is a Google drive with the original files you will need to re-create this reference video:\n\r\n\n\r\nReference video: \n\r\n\n\r\nGoogle drive: \n\r\n\n\r\nPlease complete the following steps: (this was for a b-roll style video)\n\r\n1.
