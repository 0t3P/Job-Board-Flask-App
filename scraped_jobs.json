I’ve already got the plans and the logic figured out, but I need some help actually putting the pieces together and making sure everything works the way it should.\n\nHow we’ll work together:\n\nI’m the \"Architect\"—I’ll give you the vision, the rules, and the prompts. You’ll be the one actually sitting in the cockpit, managing the AI as it builds out the features.\n\nThis isn't about you writing code from scratch. It’s about you being the \"Pilot.\" You’ll oversee the plan the AI comes up with, test what it builds, and if it’s being a bit slow or making mistakes, you’ll be the one to steer it back on track. Once you’re happy that a feature works exactly how we planned, you’ll show it to me so we can move on to the next piece of the puzzle. We'll be using specific tools like Google Antigravity and Clawdbot, but the AI will help you navigate those.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n\nYou don't need a computer science degree, but you do need to be someone who is comfortable with tech and knows how to talk to an AI to get what they want. If the AI gets stuck, I’m always here to jump in and help you troubleshoot, but I’m looking for someone who catches on quickly so we don't have to solve the same problem twice.\n\nThe Deal:\n\nI’m looking to start this as a weekly relationship. We’ll start at $50 per week, but I’m flexible. As we get more comfortable working together and the projects start coming to life, we can definitely talk about adjusting that. I’m not interested in tracking your every minute; I care about us building cool things and making steady progress.\n\nInterested?\n\nSend me a message and tell me a bit about why this \"vibe coding\" style of building appeals to you.\n\nJust to make sure you’ve got a handle on the basic tools we’ll be using: if I asked you to set up a\n bot as part of one of our apps, what’s the name of the \"Bot\" inside\n you have to message to get your API key?\n\n\n\n\n\nJust to check that you have read it till end, you can find more info about job and faster way to contact via \n PS: I dont have a pro account                                ",

    "description": "\n                    E-commerce Video Editor (Remote) - Performance Bonuses + Profit Sharing\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nWho We Are\n\n\n\nI'm Bob. I built and scaled an e-commerce brand to a team of over 20 people, then sold it and now I'm building my next brand, and I'm looking for the right people to build it with me.\n\n\n\nThe brand is in the beauty and supplement space, targeting the Scandinavian market. The ambition is to build one of the largest brands in this space in Scandinavia.\n\n\n\nBut I'm doing it differently this time.\n\n\n\nInstead of building a big team, I'm building a small group of highly talented people who want to grow together. People who care about quality over quantity. People who want to share in the profits of what we build.\n\n\n\nThe goal: a tight team building a brand doing at least $100,000 profit per month, with profit sharing for the people who helped create it.\n\n\n\nOver the past year, I taught myself how to code using AI tools and built our own software from scratch. It handles research, performance tracking, and the creative process. Still evolving, but the foundation is there. I'm telling you this because this is the mindset I want from everyone on the team. Always learning. Always improving.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nThe Role\n\n\n\nWe're looking for a video editor to join as one of the first team members.\n\n\n\nYour job is to bring scripts to life. We put serious effort into research and writing strong scripts. Your role is to turn those scripts into visuals that tell the story perfectly. Every scene, every cut, every visual choice should match what's being said. You're not just editing video. You're the storytelling of the brand.\n\n\n\nWe're not trying to mass produce ads. Our target is a win rate of over 50%. Fewer ads that actually win, not volume for the sake of volume.\n\n\n\nHere's what the role actually looks like:\n\n\n\nCreating ads for products (such as supplements and red light) that help women 40+ feel comfortable with the changes in their bodies. UGC-style ads, VSLs, and other formats for paid social. You'll work closely with me and my co-founder (both creative strategists) with each video you create.\n\n\n\nUsing AI video generation and real UGC content together. We'll work with real creators, but AI is a huge part of where things are going. We'll provide tools and courses (Runway, HeyGen, Flow from google ai studio, and others), but we want someone who explores on their own too.\n\n\n\nStudying what's working. Looking at what other brands are doing, what kind of ads are performing, and bringing insights back to the team.\n\n\n\nKeeping things organized. Using our content library, organizing footage, making it easier for the team to create better work over time.\n\n\n\nBeing okay with the startup reality. Some days you might need to create something outside your core role. That's how it works when building something from scratch.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nWhat We're Looking For\n\n\n\nStrong video editing skills. You know how to tell a story and keep people engaged throughout the entire video. Experience with Premiere Pro, Final Cut, CapCut, or similar.\n\n\n\nSomeone who understands that every visual choice matters. The right clip, the right timing, the storytelling that keeps people watching.\n\n\n\nA learning mindset. You want to get better every day. You're excited about AI tools. You don't wait to be told what to learn.\n\n\n\nSomeone who contributes, not just executes. You bring ideas to the table. You share what you've learned. You come prepared to weekly team meetings with insights and suggestions.\n\n\n\nOrganized. You keep your files, footage, and projects structured so the team can work efficiently together.\n\n\n\nE-commerce experience is a plus. If you've created UGC or VSL content before, great. If not but you're hungry to learn, we can teach you.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nWhat We Offer\n\n\n\nBase salary: $800-2000 USD per month depending on experience.\n\n\n\nPerformance bonuses. When your ads hit certain thresholds, you earn more.\n\n\n\nProfit sharing as the brand grows. The people who build the brand should share in the profits.\n\n\n\nA team that actually works together. Weekly meetings where everyone shows up, shares what they've learned, looks at what's working for us and for other brands, and brainstorms ideas to test. This isn't a job where you work alone and submit tasks. We learn and grow together.\n\n\n\nPersonal training and development. You'll work closely with me and my co-founder. Courses on AI video creation, breakdowns of winning ads, real feedback on your work.\n\n\n\nAccess to tools. AI video generation tools, our internal software, whatever you need to do great work.\n\n\n\nRoom to grow. As the brand scales, so does the team. The people here from the beginning will lead that growth.\n\n\n\nFull remote. Work from anywhere. Available 8am-5pm CET, Monday through Friday.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nThis Isn't for Everyone\n\n\n\nThis is a startup. Things are still being built. The software is evolving, the processes are evolving, and there will be things we figure out together.\n\n\n\nIf you see that as exciting, if you want to be part of a small team building something big, and if you want to grow into a leader as the brand grows, I'd love to hear from you.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\n\n\nInclude in your application:\n\n\n\n- Your portfolio (best UGC/VSL work or other video editing that shows your skills)\n\n- Your resume/CV\n\n- A brief message explaining why this opportunity interests you\n\n- Important: Include the word \"Paxa\" at the top of your application so we know you read the full post\n\n\n\nWe review applications quickly and will get back to qualified candidates within 48 hours.

    "description": "\n                    Job Description\n\nWe are seeking a proactive, organised, and reliable Video Editor to join our growing property development and investment business. This role is pivotal to how we communicate, build trust, and maintain momentum across our platforms, while also offering the opportunity to contribute to a purpose beyond the business.\n\n\n\nAs part of your responsibilities, you will primarily support Syntix Properties by reviewing footage, editing short- and long-form content in line with brand guidelines and the content schedule, creating thumbnails, preparing content for weekly review meetings, and scheduling and posting across TikTok, Meta, YouTube, and LinkedIn. You will also monitor trends, support the creation and performance tracking of ads, and report insights and recommendations to the wider team.\n\n\n\nIn addition to supporting the property business, you will occasionally edit and produce footage for NXT-GEN, helping to communicate Kingdom-focused messages and support the spreading of the gospel through high-quality, engaging content.\n\n\n\nThis is a purpose-driven role suited to someone who is creative, consistent, and dependable, with a strong eye for detail and a passion for using their editing skills to support both business growth and Kingdom impact.\n\n\n\nWhy This Role is Crucial\n\nThe role of Video Editor within our organisation is both strategic and highly valued. It sits at the heart of how Syntix Properties is seen, understood, and trusted by the market. By transforming raw footage and updates into clear, high-quality content, you help communicate our ethos of transparency, integrity, and excellence, while keeping our audience consistently informed and engaged.\n\n\n\nYour work is crucial because our content directly supports the core drivers of the business: ABS/ABR, relationship building, and investor confidence. Every reel, long-form video, thumbnail, and post is an opportunity to show who we are, what we do, and how we operate, turning our projects, knowledge, and personal stories into a repeatable system that attracts deals, partners, and investors. When the content is consistent, on-brand, and delivered on schedule, it maintains momentum, strengthens credibility, and helps the wider team execute business objectives effectively.\n\n\n\nWhat sets this role apart is its dual focus. While your primary output supports the property development business, you will also occasionally edit and produce footage for NXT-GEN. This aspect of the role allows you to use your creative skillset to support a Kingdom-focused mission, helping to communicate messages that contribute to the spreading of the gospel and creating lasting spiritual impact.\n\n\n\nIn this capacity, you enable leaders and the wider team to stay focused on high-level priorities, confident that our message is being delivered with clarity and professionalism across TikTok, Meta, YouTube, and LinkedIn. Your contribution plays a direct role in building trust, expanding our network, and supporting sustainable growth, ensuring that the standard of our public output matches the standard we uphold in our work, and supporting a purpose that goes beyond profit.\n\n\n\nProperty Development Business Support (50%) + Christian Organisation Support (50%)\n\n\n\nContent Intake: Review raw content uploaded to Dropbox and confirm files are complete, usable, and labelled correctly.\n\nEditing (Short + Long Form): Edit videos into short- and long-form formats in line with brand guidelines and the content schedule.\n\nThumbnails: Create and upload thumbnails for both short- and long-form content, consistent with brand identity.\n\nReview Meeting Prep: Ensure all content is edited and ready for the “Schedule Content Review” meeting.\n\nScheduling & Posting: Schedule and post content across TikTok, Meta, YouTube, and LinkedIn, ensuring correct captions, hashtags, and timings.\n\nTrend Monitoring: Assess trends across platforms and communicate relevant insights and opportunities to the team.\n\nPaid Ads: Create, run, and monitor ads across platforms, adjusting creatives and targeting as needed.\n\nPerformance Reporting: Review performance of content, posts, and ads; gather data and provide recommendations to the wider team.\n\n\n\nBenefits of the Role\n\nCompetitive Salary: A strong base salary reflective of your experience, skills, and the value you bring to both our business and ministry operations.\n\nPerformance-Based Bonuses: Receive a bonus for every successful property acquisition, rewarding your direct contribution to the growth and success of the company.\n\nTeam with Vision: Work alongside individuals who are passionate, focused, and aligned around a clear, purpose-driven vision.\n\nOpportunity to transition into full-time\n\n\n\nAbout Syntix Properties \n\nSyntix Properties is a dynamic property development company with a passion for breathing new life into tired and overlooked buildings. We specialise in turning neglected buildings into modern, affordable living spaces that meet the needs of today’s tenants. We aim to make property investment accessible and rewarding, while delivering high-quality, life-changing homes in partnership with trusted investors. We operate with transparency, integrity, and excellence in everything we build and manage.\n\n\n\nOur Expectation: \n\nAs a Video Editor within our organisation, you will be expected to embody and uphold the core values that define our culture and guide our work. We are committed to excellence in all that we do, and we seek team members who reflect that same standard. The following expectations are central to your success in this role:\n\nPursuit of Excellence: Approach every edit, thumbnail, caption, post, and ad creative big or small,  with a mindset of excellence. We value individuals who are proactive, detail-oriented, and committed to producing high-quality content that reflects the professionalism of our organisation.\n\nClient-Focused Mindset: Whether creating content for investors, partners, prospective clients, ministry audiences, or internal stakeholders, you are expected to maintain a service-oriented approach that prioritises the needs of those we serve and communicates clearly and responsibly.\n\nIntegrity and Transparency: Act with honesty and integrity at all times. We believe in accurate representation of our work, open communication, clear reporting on performance, and ethical conduct as the foundation for trust across both business and ministry content.\n\nResponsiveness and Reliability: Be timely and dependable in all communications and commitments. Prompt turnaround on revisions, consistent delivery against the content schedule, and reliable posting are key to maintaining momentum and strong relationships across both areas of your work.\n\nOwnership and Accountability: Take full responsibility for the end-to-end content pipeline from reviewing raw footage to delivering final edits, scheduling posts, and reporting performance, demonstrating initiative and follow-through with minimal supervision.\n\nMission-Driven Alignment: Recognise the significance of your role in both business and ministry contexts. We expect a genuine commitment to the dual nature of this role, supporting commercial growth through consistent, high-quality content while occasionally contributing to NXT-GEN and the advancement of our Christian mission.\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Skills\n\nVideo Editing Expertise: Advanced ability to edit short- and long-form content to a high standard (pacing, storytelling, sound design, captions, colour correction, graphics) with a strong understanding of platform-first editing.\n\nPlatform Knowledge (Growth Focused): Deep understanding of what performs on TikTok, Instagram/Meta, YouTube (shorts + long-form) and LinkedIn, including hooks, retention, watch time, formats, and audience behaviour.\n\nContent Strategy & Repurposing: Ability to turn raw footage into multiple high-performing assets (reels/shorts, long-form, clips, teasers) while staying aligned with brand guidelines and content schedule.\n\nThumbnail & Creative Design: Strong skills in designing high-converting thumbnails and on-screen graphics that match brand identity and improve click-through rates.\n\nTime Management & Delivery Excellence: Proven ability to hit deadlines consistently, manage multiple edits at once, and deliver content ready for review ahead of the “Schedule Content Review” meeting.\n\nAttention to Detail & Brand Consistency: Strong eye for detail to ensure every edit, caption, visual, and post aligns with the company’s brand identity, tone, and standards of excellence.\n\nAnalytics & Performance Reporting: Ability to review performance of posts and ads, interpret data (retention, CTR, engagement, conversions), and provide clear recommendations to improve results.\n\nInnovation & Trend Awareness: Proactive in identifying trends, formats, and creative angles across platforms, testing new ideas, and sharing insights that drive growth and engagement.\n\nAd Creative & Optimization: Confident in creating, running, and monitoring paid ads, including iterating creatives based on performance and communicating results to the team.\n\nTechnical Proficiency: Comfortable with professional editing tools (e.g., CapCut), motion graphics basics, file management, exporting specs, and working with Dropbox and scheduling tools.\n\nCommunication & Collaboration: Clear, professional communication with the team; able to receive feedback well, ask the right questions, and implement revisions quickly.\n\nReliability & Ownership: Takes full ownership of the content pipeline from footage review to final delivery, scheduling, and performance review without needing constant follow-up.\n\nTeam Fit & Professionalism: Positive, solutions-focused attitude; respectful, adaptable, and able to work well within a fast-moving team environment.\n\nAlignment with Mission: Supportive of the company’s values and comfortable occasionally producing content for NXT-GEN that contributes to Kingdom-focused work and the spreading of the gospel.\n\nValues: Aligns with the vision and mission of the business, demonstrating integrity, professionalism, and a commitment to excellence.

You can look at messy notes or a complicated workflow and turn it into a simple, step-by-step guide that anyone can follow. People rely on you because you write things clearly, check your work carefully, and keep everything in order.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou enjoy figuring out how things work and making sure they’re written down the right way. You’re the kind of person who spots missing steps, fixes unclear parts, and likes keeping documents tidy and easy to use.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re comfortable talking to teammates, learning how they do things, and turning that into well-written SOPs. You know your way around Google Docs, Drive, and ClickUp. You don’t need to be a crypto expert, but you can learn quickly and follow the basics.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nMost of all, you like helping teams work better by making their systems clear, easy to find, and easy to follow.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this sounds like you, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT US\n\r\nYieldschool specializes in onboarding and educating HNWI into Decentralized Finance (DeFi), also known as the Primary Crypto Markets.

Over 1,000 Members have used our system, with some achieving 500%, 1,000%, and even 3,000%+ gains in the past 12 months. We believe that DeFi is the future, and today’s decentralized infrastructure presents an unparalleled opportunity for early adopters to gain a competitive edge. Our strategic, long-term approach is focused on real value, steering away from speculation and \n coins, and enabling investors to participate in the evolution of web3 technology.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nOur founder, Frank Hepworth, is a Licensed Regulatory Financial Attorney who has worked at one of Canada’s top law firms. He’s consulted crypto exchanges on which assets they could legally list, written their policies and procedures, and negotiated with the government on their behalf. His work has contributed to the approval of the first crypto ETFs listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nOur team is made up of top-tier professionals with deep expertise across law, engineering, traditional finance, and crypto markets. We’ve brought together sharp thinkers and high-performers who could be leading anywhere, but chose to build here.

    "description": "\n                    Compensation & Incentives first month probationary period. (100 dollar increase to base everymonth thereafter)\n\r\nThis role is designed for someone who wants to prove themselves and earn based on performance.\n\r\n\n\r\nApply here: \n\r\n\n\r\nBase Retainer: $50 USD / week (Guaranteed for meeting minimum responsibilities).\n\r\n\n\r\nPerformance Bonus: $200 USD for every store that validates.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Opportunity\n\r\nI am building a data-driven, high-volume product validation machine, and I am looking for a COO-style Operations Integrator to own the execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run a lean, volume-first testing model. We don’t test 3–5 products a month; we test 40–50. We use a structured multi-phase framework (P1 ? P2 ? P3) with clear gates, risk caps, and kill rules.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe machine is built. We need someone to fly it.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be the bridge between the founder and the specialist pods (research, creatives, media buying, sourcing). Your job is simple to define but hard to execute: Turn a proven validation model into a predictable, weekly execution rhythm.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\nYou are NOT a VA ticking boxes. You are an operator.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are an \"Integrator\": You are the calm operations brain that turns strategy into checklists, timelines, and ownership.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou think in systems: You naturally map how work moves from A ? B ? C and lock in that path.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are data-literate: You don’t need to be a data scientist, but you can look at a report and instantly say, “We should kill this” or “We should keep testing this.”\n\r\n\n\r\nYou love upside: You prefer a role where your income scales with your results, rather than a flat hourly rate.\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Responsibilities\n\r\nYou will own the day-to-day orchestration of the entire validation machine.\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Pipeline & Capacity Management\n\r\n\n\r\nMaintain a clear product pipeline: Idea ? Ready to Test ? P1 ? P2 ? P3 ? Scale.\n\r\n\n\r\nEnsure we always have enough products in staging to hit our 40–50/month target.\n\r\n\n\r\nBalance team capacity so researchers, creatives, and media buyers are never idle but never overloaded.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Process & SOP Execution\n\r\n\n\r\nEnforce the 3-phase gate system. Ensure every product has the required assets before launch.\n\r\n\n\r\nConfirm kill rules and budgets are respected (prevent emotional overspend).\n\r\n\n\r\nCreate and refine SOPs: Research handoffs, creative briefs, and media buying logging.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Cross-Team Coordination\n\r\n\n\r\nRun regular check-ins with Research, Creative, and Media Buying pods.\n\r\n\n\r\nRemove bottlenecks fast: If creatives are delayed, you escalate. If a buyer hasn’t launched, you chase. If quality drops, you reset expectations.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Systems & Data Hygiene\n\r\n\n\r\nCreate and own the Notion / ClickUp / Sheets structure as the single source of truth.\n\r\n\n\r\nMaintain clean data for Products, Creatives, and Adsets so we can track validation rates and calculate bonuses accurately.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Continuous Improvement\n\r\n\n\r\nSpot inefficiencies (e.g., \"We need a better creative brief\") and implement fixes.\n\r\n\n\r\nRefine the validation model over time based on real results, not theory.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n2+ Years Experience: Operations, Project Management, or Integrator roles (ideally in E-commerce/Dropshipping).\n\r\n\n\r\nRemote Team Management: Experience coordinating different pods (researchers, editors, media buyers).\n\r\n\n\r\nTech Stack: Strong proficiency in Notion, ClickUp/Asana, Google Sheets, and Slack.\n\r\n\n\r\nMarketing Knowledge: Familiarity with ROAS, CPA, and AOV (you don’t need to be a media buyer, but you must speak the language).\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunication: Strong written English and relentless follow-through.\n\r\n\n\r\nDefinition: A store validates when it passes our internal criteria and moves into proper scaling.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Upside: Since we test 40–50 products a month, the validation volume is significantly higher than low-volume models. If you run the system well, multiple validations per month are realistic, meaning your bonus will quickly outgrow the base.\n\r\n\n\r\nGrowth: As the system proves itself, we are open to discussing higher base pay and deeper profit-share arrangements.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nRead this carefully. Applications that do not follow these instructions will be ignored.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 1: Review the full application details here:\n\r\n\n\r\nJoin \n Application Channel\n\r\n\n\r\nView Role Details on Notion\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 2: Submit your proposal with the following:\n\r\n\n\r\nAttention to Detail: Include the word “Integrator” somewhere in the first sentence of your proposal.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience: Share 1–2 specific examples where you acted as an integrator/ops manager in e-commerce. What was the monthly product or campaign volume?\n\r\n\n\r\nSystems: Describe one system or workflow you built that made a tea\naningfully more efficient. What tools did you use? How did you measure improvement?\n\r\n\n\r\nScenario: If you joined tomorrow and we needed to reliably test 40–50 products per month, how would you structure the pipeline, communication, and weekly check-ins?\n\r\n\n\r\nConfirmation: Confirm you understand and accept the compensation structure (Base + Performance Bonus).

Our CaniCol model tests many products every month using strict rules and lean budgets. Creatives are the main fuel.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are hiring one dedicated video editor to turn existing assets into short-form ads for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work only with existing footage, b-roll, product clips, images, reviews, ad library downloads, and AI tools. Your goal is to produce 100 ads per month that give us enough shots on goal to find winning products.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is ideal if you like high-output work, clear targets, and long-term stability.\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT US AND THE CANICOL MODEL\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run a lean, volume-based dropshipping system. We test many products each month and make decisions fast based on data.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur model focuses on:\n\r\nFast product testing with controlled budgets\n\r\nHigh volume of creatives per product\n\r\nClear kill, pass, and scale rules\n\r\nAccepting some false negatives in exchange for more total tests\n\r\n\n\r\nYour edits plug directly into this engine. Your ads are what we run in Phase 1 and Phase 2 tests. When a product reaches validated status using your creatives, you earn a bonus. This aligns your work with our real goal: validated products and profitable campaigns.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe work with Slack, ClickUp or Notion, and Google Drive. You will receive clear briefs and assets, and we will give feedback based on real ad performance such as hook rate and click through rate.\n\r\n\n\r\nMAIN RESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will edit 100 short-form video ads per month. Each video is usually 15 to 35 seconds, vertical 9:16 format, for TikTok, Reels, and Shorts.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work only from existing assets. Examples include competitor ads from TikTok and Meta Ad Libraries, supplier or manufacturer videos, product b-roll, product photos, customer reviews, screenshots, stock clips, and AI generated or AI assisted clips.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will create multiple variations from the same base assets. This means trying different hooks in the first 1 to 3 seconds, different scene order and pacing, and different angles and calls to action.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will add strong direct response elements. This includes clear on screen text, readable subtitles, benefit driven captions, problem and solution framing, social proof, and urgency when appropriate.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will export files correctly and keep all files named and organized following our structure in Google Drive.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will make fast revisions when we see what is working and what is not. When a product shows good signals, we will ask you for more variations quickly so we can push it through the CaniCol gates.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED SKILLS\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have experience editing short-form vertical videos for platforms such as TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be able to edit using at least one of the following: CapCut, Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or DaVinci Resolve.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must understand pacing and hooks. You know that the first 1 to 3 seconds d\n whether people keep watching or scroll.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be comfortable working completely from existing footage and from AI tools. This is an editing and repurposing role, not a filming role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be able to create clean subtitles and on-screen text in clear English.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have a reliable computer and stable internet connection that can handle video editing work.\n\r\n\n\r\nSOFT SKILLS WE VALUE\n\r\n\n\r\nYou follow instructions very carefully and care about details such as file names and structure.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou hit deadlines and weekly output targets without needing to be chased.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are open to direct feedback and can adjust your style based on performance data and comments.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou ask questions when something is unclear instead of guessing and wasting time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou want a long-term, stable role and are not just looking for a quick project.\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION AND GROWTH\n\r\n\n\r\nPay is 150USD per month retainer in exchange for 80 edited short-form ads for the first month. After proven, retainer will increase.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou also receive a 50 USD bonus for each validated product. A product is considered validated when campaigns using your creatives hit our internal performance targets over several days at proper ad spend. We will share these rules clearly in writing so you know exactly what has to happen for a product to count as validated.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs your creatives help us find more winning products, we will review your base pay and bonus structure. There is potential for higher pay and for you to become a lead editor in the future.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe pay on time and review performance regularly.\n\r\n\n\r\nWORK SCHEDULE AND SETUP\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a part-time, long-term, remote role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can set your own schedule as long as you consistently deliver your weekly output and can overlap at least 2 to 3 hours with US Eastern Time on agreed days for feedback calls or messages.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will use Slack for communication, Google Drive for assets and exports, and ClickUp or Notion for tasks. You will use your own editing software.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nOnlineJobs.ph subject line requirement:\n\r\n\n\r\nUse this exact subject line when you apply:\n\r\nBLUE – Short-Form Ads Video Editor\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the body of your application, include the following in plain text:\n\r\n\n\r\nFirst, a short introduction of 3 to 5 sentences. Tell us who you are, your experience with short-form ads, and why a high volume, repurposing focused role like this fits you.\n\r\n\n\r\nSecond, links to 3 to 6 examples of your work. These should be vertical short-form videos. Ad style edits are preferred. You can send Google Drive links, TikTok or Instagram profiles, or YouTube links. If any of these performed well in terms of views or sales, mention that.\n\r\n\n\r\nThird, answer these questions in simple text:\n\r\nWhat editing software do you use every day?\n\r\nHow many 15 to 30 second ads can you realistically edit in a full working day at good quality?\n\r\nHave you worked with ecommerce, dropshipping, or DTC brands before? If yes, what did you do?\n\r\nHave you used TikTok or Meta Ad Library before to study or repurpose ads?\n\r\nAre you comfortable with 150$ per month base pay plus 50 USD per validated product and an output of 80-100 ads per month?\n\r\n\n\r\nFourth, describe your setup. Write your computer specs including CPU, RAM, and GPU if you have one. Also tell us your internet speed. You can paste your speedtest result if you want.\n\r\n\n\r\nFifth, optional but a big plus. You may send a 1 to 2 minute Loom or unlisted YouTube video where you show one ad you edited and explain how you built the hook, the middle, and the call to action.\n\r\n\n\r\nHIRING PROCESS\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will first review applications that follow all instructions and use the correct subject line.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will then shortlist candidates based on portfolio, clarity of answers, and fit for a high-volume testing environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nShortlisted candidates will be invited to a paid test project using our assets.\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter the test project, we will choose one editor for a one month paid trial. If both sides are happy after the trial, we will continue on a long-term basis.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want a long-term, data driven editing role where your work is directly tied to validated products and bonuses, we invite you to apply.

Our CaniCol model tests many products every month using strict rules and lean budgets. Creatives are the main fuel.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are hiring one dedicated video editor to turn existing assets into short-form ads for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work only with existing footage, b-roll, product clips, images, reviews, ad library downloads, and AI tools. Your goal is to produce 100 ads per month that give us enough shots on goal to find winning products.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is ideal if you like high-output work, clear targets, and long-term stability.\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT US AND THE CANICOL MODEL\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run a lean, volume-based dropshipping system. We test many products each month and make decisions fast based on data.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur model focuses on:\n\r\nFast product testing with controlled budgets\n\r\nHigh volume of creatives per product\n\r\nClear kill, pass, and scale rules\n\r\nAccepting some false negatives in exchange for more total tests\n\r\n\n\r\nYour edits plug directly into this engine. Your ads are what we run in Phase 1 and Phase 2 tests. When a product reaches validated status using your creatives, you earn a bonus. This aligns your work with our real goal: validated products and profitable campaigns.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe work with Slack, ClickUp or Notion, and Google Drive. You will receive clear briefs and assets, and we will give feedback based on real ad performance such as hook rate and click through rate.\n\r\n\n\r\nMAIN RESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will edit 100 short-form video ads per month. Each video is usually 15 to 35 seconds, vertical 9:16 format, for TikTok, Reels, and Shorts.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work only from existing assets. Examples include competitor ads from TikTok and Meta Ad Libraries, supplier or manufacturer videos, product b-roll, product photos, customer reviews, screenshots, stock clips, and AI generated or AI assisted clips.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will create multiple variations from the same base assets. This means trying different hooks in the first 1 to 3 seconds, different scene order and pacing, and different angles and calls to action.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will add strong direct response elements. This includes clear on screen text, readable subtitles, benefit driven captions, problem and solution framing, social proof, and urgency when appropriate.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will export files correctly and keep all files named and organized following our structure in Google Drive.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will make fast revisions when we see what is working and what is not. When a product shows good signals, we will ask you for more variations quickly so we can push it through the CaniCol gates.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED SKILLS\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have experience editing short-form vertical videos for platforms such as TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be able to edit using at least one of the following: CapCut, Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or DaVinci Resolve.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must understand pacing and hooks. You know that the first 1 to 3 seconds d\n whether people keep watching or scroll.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be comfortable working completely from existing footage and from AI tools. This is an editing and repurposing role, not a filming role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be able to create clean subtitles and on-screen text in clear English.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have a reliable computer and stable internet connection that can handle video editing work.\n\r\n\n\r\nSOFT SKILLS WE VALUE\n\r\n\n\r\nYou follow instructions very carefully and care about details such as file names and structure.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou hit deadlines and weekly output targets without needing to be chased.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are open to direct feedback and can adjust your style based on performance data and comments.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou ask questions when something is unclear instead of guessing and wasting time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou want a long-term, stable role and are not just looking for a quick project.\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION AND GROWTH\n\r\n\n\r\nBase pay is 150 USD per month in exchange for 80 edited short-form ads.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou also receive a 50 USD bonus for each validated product. A product is considered validated when campaigns using your creatives hit our internal performance targets over several days at proper ad spend. We will share these rules clearly in writing so you know exactly what has to happen for a product to count as validated.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs your creatives help us find more winning products, we will review your base pay and bonus structure.

Speed-to-Lead Virtual Assistant to handle inbound buyer leads and support a mortgage-first qualification pipeline.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is built around speed, execution, and immediate follow-through.\n\r\nThis is NOT a generic VA role.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT cold calling.\n\r\nThis is NOT a sales role.\n\r\nThis is NOT a consulting role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour value in this role is how fast you react when real buyer intent appears.\n\r\n\n\r\nRole Type / Keywords\n\r\nSpeed-to-Lead VA, Appointment Setter, Mortgage Lead Follow-Up, Loan Officer Assistant, Inside Sales Agent (ISA), Buyer Leads VA, Real Estate VA, CRM Dialer, Local Presence Calling.\n\r\n\n\r\nLead Type\n\r\nYou will work with inbound buyer leads registering to view homes (MLS access, buyer inquiry forms).\n\r\n\n\r\nAll leads include:\n\r\n- Name\n\r\n- Phone number\n\r\n-\n\r\n\n\r\nPrimary market: Washington State — King County (City of Kent)\n\r\n\n\r\nThese are real buyers actively looking at homes, not cold lists.\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Responsibility\n\r\nYou must immediately contact new buyer leads and convert them into one of the following outcomes:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Completed mortgage application\n\r\n- Showed-up scheduled call with the Loan Officer\n\r\n- Confirmed cash buyer (live call completed)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou do NOT:\n\r\n- Quote rates\n\r\n- Discuss loan terms\n\r\n- Analyze income or credit\n\r\n- Provide financial advice\n\r\n\n\r\nSpeed-to-Lead Requirement (CRITICAL)\n\r\n\n\r\nEvery new lead must be contacted within 1–3 minutes of arrival.\n\r\n\n\r\n- 1–2 minutes = target\n\r\n- 3 minutes = already late\n\r\n- Delays = lost opportunity = failed performance\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you cannot consistently react within 1–3 minutes, do not apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nSpeed-to-lead is the #1 KPI in this role.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow Contact Happens (Important – Read Carefully)\n\r\n\n\r\n- When a new lead arrives, you receive an\n notification\n\r\n- You must immediately open the CRM\n\r\n- You must manually initiate the call inside the CRM\n\r\n- The CRM does NOT auto-dial\n\r\n- All calls are initiated by you\n\r\n- Calls must be started within 1–3 minutes of lead arrival\n\r\n\n\r\nMandatory Qualification Question\n\r\nEvery lead must be asked:\n\r\n\n\r\n“Will you be financing the purchase, or paying cash?”\n\r\n\n\r\nWorkflow — Financing Buyers\n\r\n\n\r\n- Clearly explain the mortgage-first process\n\r\n- Send the official Apply Now link\n\r\n- Follow up until the application is fully completed (started applications do NOT count)\n\r\n- Schedule a call with the Loan Officer\n\r\n- Ensure the borrower shows up to the scheduled call\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly completed applications qualify for bonuses.\n\r\n\n\r\nWorkflow — Cash Buyers\n\r\n\n\r\n- Tag the lead as CASH BUYER\n\r\n- Escalate immediately\n\r\n- Schedule and confirm a completed live call\n\r\n- No mortgage application required\n\r\n\n\r\nActivity-Based Follow-Up (CRITICAL)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must actively monitor lead activity inside the CRM, including:\n\r\n-\n opens\n\r\n- Link clicks\n\r\n- Replies or engagement\n\r\n\n\r\nAny detected activity creates another 1–3 minute response window.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen activity is detected, you must:\n\r\n- React immediately\n\r\n- Initiate contact within 1–3 minutes\n\r\n- Attempt to secure the next required step (call or application)\n\r\n\n\r\nMissed activity windows are treated the same as missed leads.\n\r\n\n\r\nCRM Requirement\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with BoldTrail (KV Core) is strongly preferred.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you do not have prior BoldTrail experience, you must confirm that you can:\n\r\n- Learn and operate it independently within 24 hours\n\r\n- Still meet 1–3 minute response requirements\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be comfortable:\n\r\n- Initiating calls from the CRM\n\r\n- Updating lead statuses\n\r\n- Logging notes\n\r\n- Reacting immediately to new lead activity\n\r\n\n\r\nUS Phone Number Requirement (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n\r\n\n\r\n- You must have access to a US-based phone number\n\r\n- International numbers are NOT acceptable\n\r\n- The Loan Officer must be able to call you directly from the US without international charges\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications without US phone confirmation will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nAvailability & Time Zone (IMPORTANT)\n\r\n\n\r\nInbound buyer leads typically arrive between:\n\r\n\n\r\n7:00 AM – 9:00 PM Pacific Time (Seattle time)\n\r\n\n\r\nFor reference:\n\r\n- Pacific Time (Seattle): 7:00 AM – 9:00 PM\n\r\n- Philippines Time (PHT): approximately 11:00 PM – 1:00 PM (next day)\n\r\n\n\r\nThis means:\n\r\n- Most lead activity occurs during nighttime and early daytime hours in the Philippines\n\r\n- You must be comfortable being alert and responsive during these hours\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are not comfortable covering Pacific Time windows, do not apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nCoverage is required 7 days per week.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is an on-call responsiveness role, not hourly time tracking.\n\r\nCRM and\n notifications must remain ON during coverage windows.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n\n\r\nBase Pay\n\r\n$300 per month, paid monthly\n\r\n\n\r\n- Base pay is for availability and immediate responsiveness\n\r\n- Base pay is NOT tied to hours worked\n\r\n\n\r\nPerformance Bonuses (Primary Earnings)\n\r\n\n\r\n- $15 per completed mortgage application\n\r\n- $15 per showed-up scheduled call\n\r\n- $25 per confirmed cash buyer (live call completed)\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant:\n\r\nA single lead can generate multiple bonuses.\n\r\n\n\r\nExample:\n\r\nCompleted application + showed-up call = $30 from one lead\n\r\n\n\r\nBonuses are where strong performers earn the majority of their income.\n\r\n\n\r\nPerformance & Trial Period\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is strictly KPI-driven.\n\r\n\n\r\nPerformance is reviewed daily during the first week.\n\r\n\n\r\nContinued engagement depends on:\n\r\n- Consistent 1–3 minute response time\n\r\n- Execution quality\n\r\n- Follow-through\n\r\n\n\r\nFailure to meet standards may result in immediate replacement.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nSubmit your application through this platform and include clear answers to all questions below:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Do you have access to a US-based phone number?\n\r\n2. Describe your speed-to-lead or appointment-setting experience.\n\r\n3. Confirm that you understand this is a performance-based role (not hourly).\n\r\n\n\r\nGeneric or copy-paste applications will be ignored.\n\r\nApplications without US phone confirmation will not be considered.

Evergreen Nurture & Segmentation\n\r\nBuild and maintain evergreen sequences that warm new subscribers and move them toward a call or application.\n\r\nSegment based on behavior and stage (new leads, engaged, inactive, past applicants, buyers) so people get the right messages at the right time.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Show-Up & No-Show Sequences\n\r\nWrite and optimize sequences that increase show-up rates for booked calls.\n\r\nCreate follow-up for no-shows and no-buys to recover missed revenue and keep good leads in motion.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Reactivation Campaigns\n\r\nRun quarterly reactivation campaigns for cold or inactive subscribers to generate “found” revenue from the list.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like in the First 90 Days\n\r\n- 3 complete launch sequences live, documented, and reusable.\n\r\n- 1 evergreen nurture sequence live, for new leads.\n\r\n- Show-up rate on\n-sourced calls improved vs. baseline.\n\r\n- At least 1 reactivation campaign shipped with clear revenue attribution.\n\r\n- Clear\n playbook (templates, frameworks, naming) the team can understand and reuse.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n- 3+ years professional B2C\n copy experience.\n\r\n- Proven track record owning full launch/email sequences (not just individual\ns).\n\r\n- Strong understanding of offer positioning, sequencing, and deadlines for high-ticket educational or coaching products.\n\r\n- Ability to write in a clear, human voice that resonates with senior, technical audiences.\n\r\n- Comfortable with at least 3-hour overlap with US pacific time zone, async with a distributed team, and being accountable to numbers (revenue, bookings, show rates).\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus\n\r\n- Experience with technical or software developer audiences.\n\r\n- Familiarity with platforms like Kartra, ActiveCampaign, or similar.\n\r\n- Comfortable pulling basic numbers from dashboards/CRMs to see what’s working.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nIn your application, include:\n\r\n- A brief personal intro (2–5 short sentences) in your own words.\n\r\n- 1–2 examples of launch or promo sequences you’ve written (cohort, course, or high-ticket offers).\n\r\n- A short note explaining how you approach writing launch\ns for a high-ticket cohort program.\n\r\n- Your monthly salary expectation in USD (full-time) and your official\n address.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication Question (Required):\n\r\n1. Which part of the\n lifecycle do you enjoy owning most? (launches, nurture, reactivation, post-purchase, etc.) What\n platforms have you worked in?\n\r\n2. Briefly describe one launch\n sequence you’ve owned end-to-end.\n\r\n3. In 5–7 bullet points, outline:\n\r\n- the audience\n\r\n- the goal of the sequence\n\r\n- how you structured the sequence (early ? middle ? final\ns)\n\r\n- one decision you made to avoid audience fatigue\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that skip any of the above will not be considered.

This is great if you like working by yourself in the quiet, but it can be terribly painful if you need the energy of coworkers nearby.\n\r\nOur Cultural Values - We're an American company with an incredibly unusual culture. Even by American standards, our 7 cultural values are highly unusual. Our culture is challenging for people accustomed to corporate culture and especially difficult for people who grew up in Confucian cultures. It's a great culture for people who speak directly and have a great deal of self-confidence and ownership. If you identify as a misfit, you'll do well.\n\r\nMultiple Software Systems - You're going to need to learn how to use 12 different software systems. This is great if you want to get exposed to and experience lots of technology, but it can be tough if you have a hard time learning technology. Secret Message - When you apply, you'll see a box that asks if you want to add anything else. Type in PINK ELEPHANT in all capital letters exactly as we've shown it here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCheat Code for getting a job with us:\n\r\n1) Our application comprises the majority of our recruiting process. Because of that, we suggest that you give us thoughtful responses and rich stories. We typically only interview applicants who give rich and detailed answers to our questions. If you write short responses so that you can hurry up and finish the application, you will not get interviewed.\n\r\n2) Tell us stories about how your actions match your beliefs and values. For example, if I say I value health and fitness, you don't know if I'm telling you the truth or if I'm just telling you what sounds good. But, if I tell you things I've done, I can illustrate my values of health and fitness with proof. For example, I go to the gym 4 days per week, I've done 6 triathlons, including an Ironman, and I can swim 3000 meters in one hour. My examples of things I've done prove that my actions match my values system.\n\r\n3) Be vulnerable and honest. We take very detailed notes during the interview process, and we conduct extensive background checks. If the stories you tell about yourself don't match what your references say, we will not hire you. We'd rather hire a C student who is honest about being a C student than someone who is a C student but tries to pass themselves off as an A student. Remember, this is an entry-level job. We're not looking for perfect. We're looking for an excellent cultural fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply: Please click on the link: \n/work-opportunities/administration-agent                ",

Now, we have a clear, audacious mission: to 10x our revenue in the next 12 months.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn’t a \"hope and pray\" strategy. It’s a battle plan. We need elite \"Digital Warriors\" who don't just \"do SEO\"—they command the search results.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Stakes: We Put Our Skin in the Game\n\r\nWe don’t hide behind \"SEO takes time\" excuses. We offer our clients iron-clad guarantees:\n\r\n\n\r\n- 10% of targeted keywords on Page 1 in 3 months.\n\r\n- 30% of targeted keywords on Page 1 in 6 months.\n\r\n- 60% of targeted keywords on Page 1 in 12 months.\n\r\n\n\r\nDoes this scare you, or does it excite you? If your first thought is \"That's impossible,\" keep scrolling. If your first thought is \"With my strategy and AI-driven efficiency, I can crush those numbers,\" then you’re the sniper we want.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Actually Be Doing (The Blueprint)\n\r\n- Architect of Success: You won't just advise on site structure; you’ll build the SEO Bible for our clients. You have the authority to see changes implemented.\n\r\n- AI Command & Control: You use AI models not as a crutch, but as an exoskeleton. You engineer complex prompts to automate audits, generate schema at scale, and dismantle competitor strategies piece by piece.\n\r\n- The Sherlock Holmes of Search: You conduct deep-dive technical, content, and backlink audits. You find the opportunities that Screaming Frog and Ahrefs miss because you know how to look beneath the data.\n\r\n- Translate Data into Dollars: You live in GA4 and Search Console. You ignore vanity metrics. Your focus is singular: qualified organic traffic that drives business growth.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Specialist’s Code (Is This You?)\n\r\n- Growth & Mastery: You have 3+ years in the trenches. You see a Google Update as an opportunity to leapfrog the competition, not a crisis.\n\r\n- Technical Dominance: You speak \"developer.\" You understand CMS limitations, cloud hosting, and how to work with technical teams to get it right the first time.\n\r\n- AI Power User: You are well-adept in prompt engineering. You know how to use AI to 10x your own output and accuracy.\n\r\n- Future Leader: You want to be in a commanding position. You aren't looking for a job to hide in; you're looking for a platform to lead and eventually run your own pod.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Real Pay-Off\n\r\n- Unleashed Autonomy: You get the freedom to test, experiment, and implement. This is your domain to master.\n\r\n- Remote Warfare: This is a 100% remote role. We care about the traffic graph moving up and to the right, not what chair you sit in.\n\r\n- No Nightmare Clients: We protect our warriors. If a client won't implement your expert recommendations, we fire them.\n\r\n- Empire Building: You are part of the core team. Your successes will be highly visible and critical to our 10x mission.\n\r\n\n\r\nReady to Enlist? Here’s where you can apply:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNothing else will be entertained.                ",

The objective of this role is very clear: more conversions, more completed payments, and scalable growth.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a general marketing role and not a position for juniors. I am only interested in working with experts who have already operated at a high level and who have experience with large or well-established companies. If you have not worked with serious businesses or high-volume environments, this role is not a fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe person I am looking for fully understands the complete flow of an online business: from traffic and first impression, to website structure, messaging, user behavior, checkout flow, and payment completion. You must be able to analyze my website and funnels in detail and clearly explain what needs to change to increase conversion rates and reduce drop-offs during the payment process.\n\r\n\n\r\nI expect you to be able to look at my business objectively and say exactly where money is being lost, why users are not converting at maximum potential, and what concrete steps are required to fix this. This includes improvements in UX, CRO, funnels, and payment optimization. The focus is not theory, but real, measurable impact on revenue.\n\r\n\n\r\nI want to work with someone who thinks strategically, communicates directly, and is focused on results. Someone who understands how scaling works at a professional level and who can contribute insights that actually move the business forward.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is intended for experts only. I am not interested in experiments, generic advice, or surface-level marketing tactics. I am looking for proven experience and clear value.\n\r\n\n\r\nSocial proof is required.\n\r\nWhen applying, you must clearly show:\n\r\nCompanies or brands you have worked with (preferably well-known or high-revenue businesses)\n\r\nConcrete results you have achieved (growth, conversion increases, revenue impact)\n\r\nAny relevant case studies, portfolios, or references\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation will be aligned with expertise and results, and a long-term collaboration is possible for the right person.\n\r\nIf you are an experienced growth professional who knows how to increase payments, optimize conversion flows, and scale online businesses, you are invited to apply.

This position requires deep empathy, exceptional storytelling skills, and a genuine interest in helping our audience solve their problems. You will be responsible for shaping our brand's voice and authority from the ground up.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you view content as simply a numbers game of ranking keywords and driving quick sales, this role may be a challenge for you. Only read further if you’re passionate about creating content that educates, inspires, and builds lasting relationships with an audience that trusts what we say and believes in what we do.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Job Title]\n\r\nContent Writing VA (Trust-Building & Audience Engagement)\n\r\n\n\r\n[Work Type]\n\r\nRemote | Flexible Hours | Long-term Contract\n\r\n\n\r\n[Base Payment]\n\r\nWe offer a project-based compensation structure for those who apply as part-time. That said, the expected monthly range is $\nUSD (for full-time workers), depending on factors such as proficiency, workload, task complexity, performance (including bonuses), experience, skill set, and the final scope of responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Bonus]\n\r\nThere's potential for a performance-based bonus tied to the quality of your content and its impact on audience trust. Metrics could include audience engagement, content-driven community growth, and positive feedback. We'll go over those details once you've demonstrated your skills, but you should be comfortable working with just the base pay initially.\n\r\n\n\r\n[What You’ll Be Doing]\n\r\n\n\r\nYour role is to be the voice of our brand, building a bridge of trust between us and our audience. You will be responsible for the end-to-end content creation process, ensuring every piece is valuable, credible, and engaging. Your main tasks will include:\n\r\n\n\r\na) Empathetic & In-Depth Research: Going beyond surface-level data to deeply understand our audience's pain points, desires, and values, and sourcing credible, authoritative information to build a foundation of trust in every piece of content.\n\r\n\n\r\nb) Strategic & Trust-Focused Content Planning: Brainstorming and developing content ideas and narratives that prioritize educating and helping the audience over direct selling. You will help create a content plan that ensures a consistent and reliable brand voice.\n\r\n\n\r\nc) Rhetorical & Persuasive Content Creation: Weaving compelling stories and using rhetorical skills to create memorable, relatable content that fosters a strong emotional connection with our audience. Your writing will be clear, concise, and accurate to project professionalism and build credibility.\n\r\n\n\r\nd) Human-Centric SEO Optimization: Creating content that genuinely answers the questions people are searching for. You'll use your expertise in on-page SEO (headlines, meta descriptions, internal linking) to help our valuable content get discovered by the right people.\n\r\n\n\r\ne) Meticulous Editing & Proofreading: Polishing every piece of content to eliminate any errors that could undermine our credibility. You will adhere to our style guide to maintain a unified and trustworthy brand voice.\n\r\n\n\r\nf) Insightful Performance Analysis: Focusing on engagement metrics that truly matter (like time on page, comment quality, and share rates) to understand what resonates with our audience and using that data to make our content strategy even better.\n\r\n\n\r\ng) Authentic Community Engagement: Interacting with our audience in comments and on social media in a helpful and genuine way. You will listen to their feedback and questions to inform future content, showing them their voice is heard and valued.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Goal]\n\r\nAs we grow, our ultimate goal is to build a loyal community that trusts our brand implicitly. By creating a foundation of exceptionally valuable, empathetic, and credible content, you will not only attract an audience but also turn them into advocates. Your work will be critical in establishing our brand as a leading authority in our field.\n\r\n\n\r\n[What We’re Looking For]\n\r\nThe ideal candidate:\n\r\n\n\r\na) Has Proven Content Writing Experience: You have a strong portfolio of work (blog posts, video scripts, etc.) that demonstrates your ability to research topics thoroughly, write persuasively, and build a connection with an audience.\n\r\n\n\r\nb) Possesses High Emotional Intelligence: You are empathetic and can easily put yourself in the audience's shoes. You understand how to use tone and language to create content that resonates on a personal level.\n\r\n\n\r\nc) Is an Exceptional Storyteller & Communicator: You are meticulous in your research and can transform complex information into clear, compelling, and easy-to-read content. You are proactive and professional in your communications.\n\r\n\n\r\nd) Has a Trust-First Mentality: You believe that the primary goal of content is to provide value and build a relationship. You are passionate about creating content that helps people and represents our company's values authentically.\n\r\n\n\r\ne) Is Proficient with Content & SEO Tools: You are skilled in using tools for research, writing, and basic SEO (e.g., Google Docs, Grammarly, keyword research tools).\n\r\n\n\r\nf) Communicates with Clarity and Values Respect: You are reliable, accountable, and can articulate your thoughts in a clear, logical manner.\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant Note:\n\r\nWe value respectful communication. What does it mean? Most importantly, if you need to step away, just let me or your manager know why and when. We understand it, even if you need to leave tomorrow, BUT ghosting is the last thing you'd like to do, since it causes confusion and delays.

What was your thought process from ideation to the final draft, and how did you measure its impact beyond simple metrics?\n\r\n\n\r\n3) Handling Criticism & Growth: Describe a time you received significant negative feedback on a piece of content you wrote. How did you handle the feedback, what did you learn from it, and how did it influence your approach to writing moving forward?\n\r\n\n\r\n4) Strategic Challenge: Imagine our brand is facing some skepticism in the market about a new product or service. How would you develop a content strategy to address this skepticism and rebuild trust with our audience? What are the key ethical considerations you would keep in mind?\n\r\n\n\r\n5) Ethical Persuasion: How would you explain the difference between 'persuasion' and 'manipulation' in copywriting? Can you provide an example from your own work where you consciously chose a persuasive, rather than manipulative, approach?\n\r\n\n\r\n6) Preferred Tool Stack: What are your go-to tools for research, writing, editing, and SEO? Please mention why you prefer them.\n\r\n\n\r\n7) AI in Your Workflow: Explain where and how you use AI to improve your content creation productivity (e.g., for research, brainstorming, editing), and where you deliberately choose not to rely on AI to preserve authenticity and trust. (We expect you aren't using AI to answer these questions, as they will be discussed further in an interview.)\n\r\n\n\r\n8) Available Hours: Let us know your general availability (e.g., \"Approximately 20 hours per week, mostly flexible between 1PM - 8PM on Monday, 3 PM - 10PM on Tuesday, 12PM - 8PM on Wednesday, ...,  in Philippines time\").\n\r\n\n\r\n9) Available Period of Work: Let us know for how long you expect to work with us.

    "description": "\n                    [Caution]\n\r\nIf you are a slow reader, this job may become a torture for you, so I'd like you to beware.\n\r\nBut if you're a fast reader with keen eyes for the details, this can be a fun part time job for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nAlso, if you were going to use AI for this task, please step out. I discovered that you cannot use AI tools for this particular task, as you'd need to pick the best sentence among the 5 versions of the same context for each sentence one by one. I've tried this task with AI myself, and trust me it's my current best friend, but it cannot give me the result at the human level that I'd like. So, no AIs period.\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, only read further if you are confident in your ability to consistently select the most effective phrasing to build a high-quality, engaging video script.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role requires a keen eye for detail and a strong sense of narrative flow. If you have a passion for reading long scripts and enjoy learning about storytelling techniques while phrasing impactful sentences, this position will be a great fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis job relies on your human judgment to discern which sentence best serves the story and engages the viewer. The goal is to create a script that is clear, compelling, and flows seamlessly from one idea to the next.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[Job Title]\n\r\nProofreading - selecting best sentences among 5 variations\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[Work Type]\n\r\nRemote | Flexible Hours | Long-term Contract\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[Base Payment]\n\r\nYou’ll receive $100 USD per 10 project.\n\r\nCurrently, the other assistant gets each project done in 3-4 hours.\n\r\nI can provide 3-7 projects per week, depending on your speed.\n\r\nEach project involves working on a script for my video (each project = around 5000 words in English).\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[Bonus]\n\r\nThere's potential for a performance-based bonus through revenue sharing, depending on how well the long-form YouTube video performs in terms of views. We'll go over those details once you've demonstrated your skills, but you should be comfortable working with just the base pay initially.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[What You’ll Be Doing]\n\r\n\n\r\nYour primary task is to assemble the best possible version of a video script by choosing the most effective sentence from a set of options.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor a script of approximately 5000 words, each sentence will be presented with five different variations. Your job is to read through all five options and select the one that works best in the context of the paragraph and the overall script. You will repeat this process for every sentence until the entire script is complete.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere’s a step-by-step process for clarity:\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 1. Understand the Context - You will receive a complete script where each sentence is accompanied by five alternative versions.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 2. Select the Best Sentences - Choose the option that offers the best clarity, flow, and impact. Your selection should contribute to a cohesive and engaging narrative.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 3. Double Check - Once you have made a selection for every sentence, read through the completed script one last time to ensure it is coherent and polished.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 4. Submit the final script.\n\r\n\n\r\n*Note:\n\r\n-The first project may take a bit longer as we align on tone and style with feedback and revisions. I’ll provide detailed feedback on your first completed script to help guide that alignment.\n\r\n\n\r\n-I intend to reduce the revisions down to 1, but initially we may need more.\n\r\n\n\r\n-With each run, you will become more familiar with the content style, and the selection process will become faster and more intuitive on your end.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[Goal]\n\r\n\n\r\nThe goal is to craft a highly engaging and easy-to-follow script by meticulously selecting the best version of every sentence. This process ensures the final script is polished and holds the audience's attention from start to finish.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis method is designed to be more efficient than rewriting from scratch. Instead of spending time guessing my intended tone, you can focus entirely on choosing the strongest lines from pre-written options, which keeps the process focused and effective.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[What We’re Looking For]\n\r\nThe ideal candidate:\n\r\n\n\r\n-Has an advanced or native level of written English and a strong grasp of grammar, idioms, and slang. This is crucial for quickly and accurately judging which phrases are most effective.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Is coachable and eager to grow with the channel.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Communicates effectively and values mutual respect.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Has strong time management skills to meet deadlines.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Is accountable and committed to the role.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Can collaborate with me or our team to ensure the content’s vibe aligns with our creative vision.\n\r\n\n\r\n*Important Note:\n\r\nWe value respectful communication. If you need to step away, just let me or your manager know when. Your feedback also helps us improve. We understand life happens, even if you need to leave tomorrow, but ghosting causes confusion and delays. Our team thrives on mutual respect, no matter your role.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[Why Work With Us?]\n\r\n-Flexible hours to suit your lifestyle.\n\r\n-Long-term growth opportunities as the channel scales.\n\r\n-A supportive environment that celebrates creativity and input.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[About Us]\n\r\nWe help YouTube creators master storytelling techniques to captivate audiences and achieve viral success. Your role will be key in polishing our content and empowering creators worldwide.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[MUST READ]\n\r\nIn your application, include:\n\r\n1. Start your response with the following word at the top: \"IREADFAST\"\n\r\n2. Experience or Work History: Share any relevant experience in proofreading, editing, or writing.\n\r\n3.
