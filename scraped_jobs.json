The system has two layers:\n\r\n\n\r\n### LAYER 1: The Mark Douglas Foundation (Mandatory for All Users)\n\r\n\n\r\nMark Douglas is the godfather of trading psychology. His book \"Trading in the Zone\" is the definitive text on why traders fail psychologically.

You earn approx. 14,000 PHP ($335 CAD) for every single sale.\n\r\n* The Target: Close just 2 deals a month = 28,000 PHP.\n\r\n* The Accelerator: Continue earning 14,000 PHP for every single sale after that.\n\r\n* The Potential: Uncapped. Our top reps aim for 60,\n,000+ PHP monthly.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE ROLE:\n\r\n\n\r\n* Outbound Hunting: You will call North American businesses (EST hours) to demo our software.\n\r\n* Closing: You are not just setting appointments; you are closing the deal.\n\r\n* Tools: We provide the dialer, the leads, and the training. You bring the hustle.\n\r\n* Schedule: Flexible, but you must be willing to make calls during Canadian Business Hours (Eastern Standard Time).\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO YOU ARE:\n\r\n\n\r\n* Hungry: You prefer uncapped commission over a limited salary because you know you can sell.\n\r\n* Experienced: You have done outbound B2B sales or appointment setting before (SaaS preferred).\n\r\n* Tech-Savvy: You can learn a new software product quickly so you can demo it with confidence.\n\r\n* Resilient: You have a thick skin and a neutral/professional English accent.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY (STRICT REQUIREMENT):\n\r\nI am looking for a star.

This is great if you like working by yourself in the quiet, but it can be terribly painful if you need the energy of coworkers nearby.\n\r\nOur Cultural Values - We're an American company with an incredibly unusual culture. Even by American standards, our 7 cultural values are highly unusual. Our culture is challenging for people accustomed to corporate culture and especially difficult for people who grew up in Confucian cultures. It's a great culture for people who speak directly and have a great deal of self-confidence and ownership. If you identify as a misfit, you'll do well.\n\r\nMultiple Software Systems - You're going to need to learn how to use 12 different software systems. This is great if you want to get exposed to and experienced with lots of technology, but it can be tough if you have a hard time learning technology. Secret Message - When you apply, you'll see a box that asks if you want to add anything else. Type in PINKELEPHANT in all capital letters exactly as we've shown it here.\n\r\n\n\r\nCheat Code for getting a job with us:\n\r\n1) Our application comprises the majority of our recruiting process. Because of that, we suggest that you give us thoughtful responses and rich stories. We typically only interview applicants who give rich and detailed answers to our questions. If you write short responses so that you can hurry up and finish the application, you will not get interviewed.\n\r\n2) Tell us stories about how your actions match your beliefs and values. For example, if I say I value health and fitness, you don't know if I'm telling you the truth or if I'm just telling you what sounds good. But, if I tell you things I've done, I can illustrate my values of health and fitness with proof. For example, I go to the gym 4 days per week, I've done 6 triathlons, including an Ironman, and I can swim 3000 meters in one hour. My examples of things I've done prove that my actions match my values system.\n\r\n3) Be vulnerable and honest. We take very detailed notes during the interview process, and we conduct extensive background checks. If the stories you tell about yourself don't match what your references say, we will not hire you. We'd rather hire a C student who is honest about being a C student than someone who is a C student but tries to pass themselves off as an A student. Remember, this is an entry-level job. We're not looking for perfect. We're looking for an excellent cultural fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply: Please click on the link: \n/work-opportunities/administration-agent                ",

    "description": "\n                    Remote Support Technician (Level 2)\n\r\nWork From Home  •  Philippines-Based  •  No Phone Required\n\r\nElevatus is a U.S.-based managed IT services provider looking for a skilled, detail-oriented Level 2 Support Technician to join our team remotely from the Philippines. This is a work-from-home position with no client-facing phone calls — you will handle backend technical support tasks that keep our clients’ environments running smoothly while our Frontline Engineers focus on direct client relationships.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you have MSP experience, take pride in doing clean, thorough work, and want to be part of a collaborative team that values people as much as technical skill, we want to hear from you.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Elevatus IT\n\r\nWe are a managed IT services company built on two things: technical excellence and genuine care for the people we serve. Our team is made up of skilled, personable engineers who work together — not in isolation. We believe our greatest strength is our people and how they collaborate. We currently have two Philippines-based tea\nmbers who have each been part of the Elevatus IT family for nearly three years. This role is an expansion of that success — not an experiment. When you join Elevatus IT, you are not just filling a seat. You are becoming part of a team that has each other’s backs.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nAs a Remote Support Technician, you will work from a dedicated ticket queue handling process-driven, repeatable tasks that do not require direct interaction with end users. Your work frees up our client-facing engineers to focus on relationships and real-time support, while you ensure the back-end work gets done right.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a call center position. There are no phone calls. Client interaction, if any, is limited to occasional\n for resolution verification. The majority of your work is independent execution of documented procedures with access to a collaborative team when you need support.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Be Doing\n\r\n• Assessing\n legitimacy (phishing analysis, header review, SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks)\n\r\n• Whitelisting and blacklisting\n addresses and domains in\n security platforms\n\r\n• Onboarding new users: creating accounts, assigning licenses, configuring mailboxes, setting group memberships\n\r\n• Offboarding departing users: disabling accounts, revoking access, converting mailboxes, removing licenses\n\r\n• Password resets with secure delivery methods\n\r\n• MFA enrollment resets and user re-enrollment coordination\n\r\n• Shared mailbox creation, permissions management, and calendar configuration\n\r\n• Distribution list and security group management\n\r\n•\n forwarding rules and auto-reply configuration\n\r\n• Quarantine management and spam filter adjustments\n\r\n• Maintaining accurate ticket documentation and time entries\n\r\n• Updating client documentation when discrepancies are found\n\r\n• Identifying runbook gaps and recommending improvements\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’re Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired\n\r\n• Minimum 2 years of experience in IT support at a Level 2 capacity or above\n\r\n• Strong working knowledge of Microsoft 365 administration (user management, Exchange Online, Entra ID, licensing)\n\r\n• Experience with Active Directory (account creation, group management, password administration)\n\r\n• Solid understanding of\n security concepts (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, phishing identification)\n\r\n• Excellent written English — professional, clear, and grammatically correct\n\r\n• Reliable high-speed internet and a dedicated, private home workspace\n\r\n• Willingness to work a schedule that includes a minimum 4-hour overlap with U.S. Eastern Time business hours\n\r\n• Self-motivated and disciplined — able to manage your own queue and time without constant supervision\n\r\n• Strong documentation habits — you believe in writing things down thoroughly and clearly\n\r\n\n\r\nHuge Plus\n\r\n• Prior MSP / Managed Service Provider experience. If you’ve worked in an MSP environment, you already understand the pace, the tools, and the multi-client reality of this work. This is a significant advantage.\n\r\n• Experience with PSA/ticketing systems (Autotask, ConnectWise, or similar)\n\r\n• Experience with documentation platforms (ITGlue, Hudu, or similar)\n\r\n• Experience with\n security platforms (AppRiver, Proofpoint, Barracuda, or similar)\n\r\n• Familiarity with compliance frameworks (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, CMMC)\n\r\n• Experience with RMM tools (N-central, NinjaOne, ConnectWise Automate, or similar)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n• Work from home — permanently. This is not a temporary remote arrangement. This role is designed to be fully remote.\n\r\n• A real team. You are not an outsourced resource sitting in a silo. You will join two existing Philippines-based tea\nmbers who have been with us for nearly three years each. You will be part of our daily communication, have access to the same escalation support as our local engineers, and be treated as a full member of the team.\n\r\n• Clear expectations and support. We provide detailed runbooks, thorough documentation, and a collaborative culture where asking for help is encouraged — not penalized.\n\r\n• Growth potential. As you demonstrate proficiency and reliability, your scope and responsibilities can expand.\n\r\n• Structured onboarding. We do not throw you into the deep end. You will go through a supervised onboarding process with clear milestones before handling tickets independently.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Is Not\n\r\nWe want to be upfront so we attract the right candidates:\n\r\n\n\r\n• This is not a phone support role. You will never make or receive client phone calls.\n\r\n• This is not a help desk / Level 1 role. We expect Level 2 technical proficiency from day one.\n\r\n• This is not unsupervised freelancing. You will work set hours, follow established procedures, and be accountable to performance metrics.\n\r\n• This is not an overnight data entry position. This is real technical work that requires real technical skill and judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nSend us your resume and a brief cover letter. In your cover letter, tell us:\n\r\n1.  Your experience with Microsoft 365 administration and Active Directory.\n\r\n2.  Whether you have MSP experience, and if so, which tools and PSA/RMM platforms you’ve used.\n\r\n3.  Your available working hours and how they overlap with U.S. Eastern Time.\n\r\n4.  A brief description of your home workspace setup (internet speed, dedicated space, power backup if applicable).\n\r\nWe review every application personally. If your background is a good fit, we’ll be in touch.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Please do not apply unless you consider your edits to be truly EPIC! Experienced editors with good taste only please!\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you really want to speed up the process and are prepared to do a trial edit, select one of the 3 editing types below, I will provide you some clips, and you can spend 30 minutes to create a short reel.\n\r\n- Or, even better - just take a couple of reels off my instagram, make a creative 15s edit. Impress me, instead of just sending another ChatGPT message with a portfolio link ;)\n\r\n\n\r\nI need an epic short form editor to join my team! Currently it's me doing everything - i am running a video business, i do all the filming, finding clients from various niches, but I need a solid editor for on-going employment as I continue to grow. Currently the number of clients coming in is way more than I can handle, and I'm just getting started. I plan to build a team of 3-4 full time editors over the coming 6 months\n\r\n\n\r\nThere is a wide variety of edits I will need help with, including: engaging podcast edits, cinematic montages, fast paced ADs, funny skits. It is not necessary that you are great at everything - but being a master of 1 or 2 styles is helpful as I continue to hire more editors.\n\r\n\n\r\nIt is ideal if you use Da vinci resolve, but if you are good at what you do then any software will be fine. Ultimately I will be hiring many editors and I will help maintain the quality control over everything! My clients love me for my filming & editing style - I am always trying to improve and push the boundaries of how we tell stories with visuals - anyone joining my team must be serious about becoming a truly great editor!\n\r\n\n\r\nYour role will be to help me produce a higher volume of quality content for a wide range of clients. Saving me time in my own editing process. Also helping me create BTS reels and all sorts of things, but I will rather learn where your skills are best and give you more work there.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs for how to test applicants, there will be a first interview. Then, you will create 4 reels in 4 hours. This will be a paid trial. \n\r\n\n\r\n- 1 hour: a 'cinematic montage' reel - 10-15s\n\r\nThis is a fast-paced dynamic edit using my camera clips, visual & musical, 10-15seconds length. But don't just choose cool clips, tell a story with the order of the clips. You have one hour to create a scroll stopping, visually engaging short reel that makes people want to watch again. Make it pop with a few sound effects as well!\n\r\n\n\r\n- 1 hour: a 'story' reel: 30s\n\r\nI provide a 30 second interview snippet (that I have already edited the pacing of) and b-roll clips, you will place the clips to help tell the story that is being spoken. You have one hour to create as much emotional impact with the clip selection with the story. This isn't about fancy effects - this is about carefully choosing the right camera clips, matching the action, emotional impact of the clips, zooms and crops to make the footage flow smoothly. Cinematic bro. Haha\n\r\n\n\r\n- 1 hour: a 'podcast' reel - 1:30-2 mins\n\r\nI provide a podcast clip (usually 1:30-2 mins in length) that I have already edited for pacing. You will edit over the top, adding engaging visuals that compliment the conversation. You have one hour to take my initial podcast edit, and give it an engaging & complimentary visual experience. Aim for roughly 60/40: 60% of the time the conversation is on the screen, and 40% cutting away to other clips and visuals. Be a bit creative here...\n\r\n\n\r\n- 1 hour: 'wildcard' reel - 30s\n\r\nMake whatever you want, just make it cool! Use camera clips from a shoot to make one reel. 30s\n\r\n\n\r\nNow, this of course isn't enough time to make the best reels in the world! this is just for me to see how well you can work with timeframes, as we are creating such a high volume of reels we need to have predictable systems to know how long a job will take. For example, I know that on average it takes me about 10 hours to edit 15 reels for some of my client packages. We will have to be flexible with timeframes, as different clients will be paying more for higher quality reels - those will require more effort. Sometimes we are provided 20+ reels to a client at a lower price, these must be completed in less time! In these cases, its more about having good taste than just mindless editing.\n\r\n\n\r\nCheck out some of my work on \n                ",
