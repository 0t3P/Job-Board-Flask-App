    "description": "\n                    About the Role\n\r\nWe run a US-based luxury hospitality portfolio — currently 3–6 short-term rental properties and a boutique micro-wedding venue. We're looking for an Operations Manager, not a Virtual Assistant.\n\r\nWe run a modern, tech-forward operation — we use a lot of tools, build custom systems, and lean on AI to work smarter. You don't need to be an engineer, but you do need to be the kind of person who picks up new software quickly and genuinely enjoys finding better ways to do things.\n\r\nThis role is the \"Control Tower\" of our business. You will own logistics, guest experience, wedding sales, and brand marketing simultaneously — solving problems, spending company money when needed, and making judgment calls without waiting on the owner. If you need to be told what to do every hour, this is not the right fit. If you thrive with real ownership and a direct line to leadership, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Own\n\r\n1. Logistics & Procurement\n\r\nYou are responsible for ensuring our properties never run out of supplies. You'll manage inventory across all locations, use the company card to reorder linens, toiletries, and consumables proactively, and maintain accurate stock logs. You own this — not us.\n\r\nCleaner & Contractor Oversight: You are the direct supervisor for our cleaning teams. You'll set schedules, review photo quality reports after each turnover, and approve payments. If something breaks — a heater, a lock, an appliance — you troubleshoot with the guest, source and hire a local contractor, authorize payment, and then notify the owner once it's resolved.\n\r\n2. Wedding Venue Sales & Coordination\n\r\nOur systems are set up to help you respond to inbound wedding inquiries within 5 minutes during your shift — and that standard is non-negotiable. You'll answer questions about pricing, capacity, and availability with a warm, white-glove tone that matches the caliber of our venue. You'll qualify leads, schedule on-site tours, and keep our CRM (HoneyBook/Dubsado) clean and up to date so no lead falls through the cracks.\n\r\n3. Guest Experience — Short-Term Rentals\n\r\nOwn all guest communication from inquiry to checkout across Airbnb and VRBO. Handle escalations, disputes with platform support, and craft professional responses to reviews — both positive and negative.\n\r\n4. Content & Marketing \n\r\nThis is a real part of the job, not an afterthought. You'll be responsible for:\n\r\n- Social media posting and scheduling across Instagram,\n, and TikTok using our content calendar and tools (e.g., Later, Buffer, or similar)\n\r\n- Marketing\n execution — sending pre-written or lightly templated campaigns to our lead lists via our\n platform (e.g., Mailchimp, Klaviyo, or similar)\n\r\n- Keeping our pipeline warm — following up with cold leads, past inquirers, and potential repeat guests using pre-approved messaging\n\r\n\n\r\nYou won't be writing strategy from scratch, but you need strong written English and an eye for what looks and sounds premium.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\n\n\r\n- 3+ years of experience in operations, property management, event coordination, or a hybrid hospitality/marketing role\n\r\n- Must be available to work full-time, Monday–Friday, 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM CST (US Central Time) — this is a hard requirement, no  exceptions\n\r\n- Prior experience handling company expenses, purchasing, or petty cash — you will be trusted with a company card\n\r\n- Fluent English communication, both written and spoken — you will be on calls with guests, wedding couples, and vendors regularly and must be able to represent the brand with confidence and warmth\n\r\n- Solid working knowledge of Google Drive, Sheets, and Docs as a daily operating environment\n\r\n- Comfortable with a tools-heavy workflow — you'll use multiple platforms simultaneously and are expected to learn new software quickly, including tools that are custom-built for our operation\n\r\n- At least passing familiarity with Slack, a CRM platform (HoneyBook, Dubsado, or similar), a social media scheduling tool (Later, Buffer, or similar), and Airbnb/VRBO host dashboards\n\r\n- Open to using AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude as part of your day-to-day — we'll show you how we use them, but curiosity beats credentials here\n\r\n- High emotional intelligence — you can de-escalate a frustrated guest and keep an anxious bride feeling taken care of, all in the same afternoon\n\r\n- Strong written English with a warm, professional tone that reflects a premium brand\n\r\nPlatform experience with Ownerrez is a strong plus but not required — we'll train the right person\n\r\n\n\r\nHardware Requirements: Reliable PC or Mac, 25 Mbps+ internet connection, Noise-canceling headset (required for guest and vendor calls)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role\n\r\nOur last ops hire treated this like a task queue. We need someone who treats it like a business they co-own. As we add properties — and we are actively acquiring — your scope and compensation grow with us. This is a long-term career position with a direct relationship with the owner, not a seat in a call center.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nApplications that don't follow these instructions will not be reviewed — this is your first test of attention to detail.\n\r\nSend an\n with the subject line: Hospitality Ops Manager – [Your Name]\n\r\nInclude:\n\r\n1. Your resume or portfolio link.\n\r\n2. Written answers to both scenarios below:\n\r\nScenario A — The Inventory Problem: You review a cleaner's post-checkout report and notice one of our properties has 2 rolls of toilet paper left. A guest checks in tomorrow. Next-day delivery isn't available and the owner is unreachable. What do you do, step by step?\n\r\nScenario B — The Wedding Inquiry: A bride\ns asking to tour the venue this Saturday at 2 PM. Your calendar shows a private event in progress at that time. Write the actual reply you'd send her — it must decline that slot while keeping her warm and moving toward a booking.                ",

As a premier Google Workspace partner, we’ve spent 15 years helping over 5,000 business owners transition from startup chaos to scalable, efficient operations with Google Workspace and other cloud tools.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are currently building a global, high-volume, systems-first consultancy. To achieve this, we need a Marketing Project Manager who views marketing as an engineering challenge—focusing on building the “pipes” that drive consistent, global growth.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role: Strategic Execution & Workflow Management\n\r\nWe prioritize data-driven execution over traditional marketing “fluff.”\n\r\n\n\r\nReporting directly to the Chief of Growth, your role is to bridge the gap between high-level strategy and tactical output. You won’t be managing a large internal team; instead, you will orchestrate a network of specialist contractors and automated systems to ensure our organic growth engine—primarily driven by our high-authority YouTube channel—is running at peak performance.\n\r\n\n\r\n? Why Join Our High-Performance Team?\n\r\nWe offer a remote-first culture that values systems, clarity, and measurable results.\n\r\n\n\r\nWork From Anywhere: Permanent work-from-home (aligned with Philippine Time).\n\r\nClear Career Growth: Budget for professional certifications and a defined path toward senior leadership.\n\r\nPerformance-Based Rewards: A monthly success bonus tied directly to the achievement of your KPIs.\n\r\nDynamic Culture: Annual team conferences (past locations include Boracay) and a focus on holistic well-being.\n\r\nComprehensive Benefits: Competitive compensation, health allowances, and tech support for your home office.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Responsibilities\n\r\nYou will oversee the marketing portfolio, ensuring every project is clearly defined, properly resourced, and delivered on schedule.\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Content Strategy & Production Management: Direct our external editors and copywriters. Your task is to ensure all content aligns with our brand voice—the “Calm Expert Guide”—and effectively solves real-world business problems for our audience.\n\r\n2. Growth Research & Competitive Analysis: Oversee our YouTube and search research process. You will identify high-demand topics and work with creatives to package them into high-performing titles and thumbnails.\n\r\n3. Customer Lifecycle & Marketing Automation: Manage and optimize the customer journey within our CRM (Intercom). You will build and refine automated nurture sequences that guide prospects through our service tiers.\n\r\n4. Technical SEO Coordination: Collaborate with our Engineering team to ensure our web properties remain healthy, crawlable, and optimized for the next generation of AI-driven search.\n\r\n5. Performance Analytics: You will monitor and validate marketing KPIs bi-weekly, providing actionable insights during our Growth Sync meetings to improve ROI across all organic channels.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are (Fit & Mindset)\n\r\nWe look for candidates who demonstrate high ownership and a systems-first approach to problem-solving.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe “Systems Thinker”: You fundamentally understand B2B marketing funnels and how to manage complex workflows in a remote, international environment.\n\r\nThe “Tech-Savvy Professional”: You are comfortable navigating new tools, directing technical implementations, and taking absolute accountability for project outcomes.\n\r\nThe “Accountable Executor”: You are a power-user of project management tools (Asana preferred). You can write clear, “fail-proof” creative briefs and keep multiple contractors moving toward a single goal.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Qualifications\n\r\n- 5+ Years in Marketing Operations or Project Management: Preferably within a B2B, SaaS, or tech consulting environment.\n\r\n- Contractor Management: Proven experience sourcing, briefing, and holding external freelancers accountable for quality and deadlines.\n\r\n- Tool Proficiency: Strong experience with Asana (or similar), CRM automation platforms, and an understanding of YouTube/Search analytics.\n\r\n- Communication Excellence: You bring solutions, not just problems, and communicate with clarity and professionalism.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Schedule\n\r\n- 8-hour shift, Philippine Time but flexible as some team are based in Europe.\n\r\n- Monday to Friday (Weekends off).\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAre You Ready to Scale with Us?\n\r\nIf you’re ready to build a scalable marketing machine that delivers tangible business impact, we’d love to meet you.\n\r\n\n\r\nApply Now and tell us: Which specific marketing system or workflow have you built that you are most proud of?
