    "description": "\n                    Role\n\r\nFull-stack developer to build a financial data platform.  The main feature will be an AI-powered financial chatbot. Users will be able to ask questions like, “What are Amazon’s cloud revenues for each of the last 5 years?” and the answer will show a chart and text. In addition to the chatbot, developer will build dashboards and pages showing how markets are trading through charts, tables, heatmaps, screeners, watchlists, etc. Work spans the full stack: backend (data pipelines, caching, database optimization), AI (LLM flows, RAG, prompt tuning), and frontend (js charting libraries and responsive UI). An early version of the watchlist, which will be one component of the final product, is live at \n.\n\r\n\n\r\nChatbot Feature - What you’ll work on\n\r\n\n\r\nBuild data pipelines: ingest financial data from APIs ? parse and transform into structured formats ? store in PostgreSQL. Data includes structured data (financials, prices, earnings, analyst ratings) and unstructured documents (SEC filings, earnings call transcripts, investor presentations, etc.).\n\r\nBuild LLM pipelines: documents ? Embeddings (OpenAI) ? vector retrieval via pgvector (RAG) ? prompt construction ? answer generation ? validation (catch wrong numbers, dates, hallucinations).\n\r\nPrompt engineering: tune prompts to improve accuracy, reduce hallucinations, and handle edge cases.\n\r\nCharts: build visualizations for chat responses using Highcharts or similar.\n\r\nScale coverage: extend to thousands of US stocks.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy charts matter\n\r\nA major differentiator is how we present data visually within the chatbot. We’ll post charts on X and other platforms to grow our audience. If you’ve made data look beautiful with JS charting libraries, that’s a big plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nCollaboration\n\r\nDeveloper will work directly with the founder, who handles product direction and domain expertise (finance background, 10+ years investing/trading), while dev handles the technical execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nCurrent tech stack\n\r\nFrontend: React, Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS\n\r\nBackend: Next.js Server Actions, API Routes \n\r\nDatabase: Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector for embeddings)\n\r\nAI/LLM: OpenAI API (incl. embeddings), prompt engineering, RAG patterns\n\r\nCharts: Highcharts, TradingView Lightweight Charts, HTML5 Canvas\n\r\nData APIs: Financial Market API (FMP, \n, etc.), SEC EDGAR\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired\n\r\nExperience with React and TypeScript\n\r\nExperience with Next.js\n\r\nExperience with PostgreSQL\n\r\nUnderstanding of REST APIs and data fetching patterns\n\r\nExperience with OpenAI API or similar LLM integrations\n\r\nFamiliarity with vector databases and RAG patterns\n\r\nKnowledge of real-time data patterns (WebSockets, polling)\n\r\nClean code practices and attention to detail\n\r\nGreat English and communication skills\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to have\n\r\nExperience with financial data or fintech applications\n\r\nExperience with JS charting libraries (Highcharts, Chart.js, D3, Recharts, TradingView Lightweight Charts, etc.)                ",

With nearly two decades of expertise and an expanding global footprint across Asia and beyond, we’re scaling from product-market fit into aggressive growth. Our products—including the Hardwire gaming earbuds and SANWEAR-GT wireless earbuds—are built for gamers who demand exceptional audio quality and comfort. We’re a lean, fast-moving team that punches well above its weight.\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nWe’re looking for a Customer Experience Manager to take full, end-to-end ownership of customer support at SAN Sound. This is not a ticket-answering role—this is a department-building role. You will be the first dedicated hire in this function and will be responsible for architecting, executing, and scaling our entire customer experience operation from the ground up.\n\r\nIn the early days, you’ll be hands-on—handling all inbound customer inquiries, building AI-powered response systems, creating templates, and establishing the processes and data infrastructure that will allow us to scale. As the business grows, you’ll hire and manage a team beneath you. You’ll work closely with our AI system developers and communications team (copywriting and product tech) to build intelligent, seamless support across\n, website, and potentially voice channels.\n\r\nThe right person for this role has built a CS department before, thinks strategically about customer experience as a competitive advantage, and is energized by the challenge of building infrastructure that can handle 10x growth.\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\nDepartment Strategy & Build-Out\n\r\n• Own the full customer experience function from day one—strategy, execution, and continuous improvement\n\r\n• Design and implement the CS department architecture working with our developers: workflows, escalation paths, SLAs, and KPIs\n\r\n• Develop a scalable support model leveraging AI-first principles with human oversight\n\r\n• Propose and get approval for builds, tooling, and team expansion from the COO\n\r\n• Create a roadmap to move from one-person operation to a fully staffed, scalable department\n\r\nAI-Powered Support Operations\n\r\n• Collaborate with AI system developers to architect and optimize automated\n responses, website AI chat support, and future AI voice/call support\n\r\n• Work with the communications team (copywriting and product tech) to ensure AI responses reflect brand voice, product accuracy, and customer empathy\n\r\n• Build, maintain, and continuously refine response templates and AI training data\n\r\n• Monitor AI performance and identify gaps where human intervention improves outcomes\n\r\nHands-On Customer Support\n\r\n• Handle all customer inquiries across channels during the initial build phase\n\r\n• Monitor and respond to customer issues via Zendesk,\n, and Shopify\n\r\n• Ensure timely, high-quality resolutions that reflect SAN Sound’s premium brand standards\n\r\n• Manage returns, exchanges, warranty claims, and order-related issues\n\r\nData, Reporting & Continuous Improvement\n\r\n• Build and maintain a data tracking and reporting framework for CS operations\n\r\n• Record, analyze, and report on customer inquiries, resolution times, satisfaction scores, and recurring issues\n\r\n• Use data insights to drive improvements in AI responses, templates, processes, and product feedback loops\n\r\n• Provide regular performance reports and strategic recommendations to the COO\n\r\nSocial Media Comment Support\n\r\n• Monitor and respond to customer queries, comments, and feedback across SAN Sound’s social media channels\n\r\n• Ensure timely, on-brand responses to product questions, support issues, and general engagement on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and\n\r\n• Triage and escalate complex issues from social media to the appropriate internal teams or support channels\n\r\n• Collaborate with the Social Media Manager to maintain a consistent, helpful brand voice in public-facing interactions\n\r\nCommunity Management (Secondary)\n\r\n• Monitor SAN Sound’s \n community for customer issues, product feedback, and engagement opportunities\n\r\n• Provide a consistent, helpful brand presence in community channels\n\r\n• Escalate community-surfaced issues to the appropriate internal teams\n\r\n• Note: This responsibility is secondary to core CS operations and assumes AI is handling the heavy lifting on support volume\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n• 4+ years of experience managing customer service end-to-end, with demonstrated experience building out a CS department or function from scratch\n\r\n• Strong understanding of ecommerce customer experience for DTC brands; gaming or audio industry experience is a significant plus\n\r\n• Proficiency with Zendesk (required), Shopify, and modern CS tooling\n\r\n• Comfort working with AI tools and a forward-thinking mindset on AI’s role in customer support—you don’t need to build AI systems, but you need to drive buildouts alongside developers\n\r\n• Fluent in English (written and verbal)—communication clarity is essential even when leveraging AI\n\r\n• Experience with ClickUp, Google Workspace (GSuite), and \n\r\n• Highly organized, self-motivated, and capable of working autonomously in a remote, distributed team environment\n\r\n• Strong analytical skills—comfortable building reporting frameworks and using data to drive decisions\n\r\n• Excellent judgment on when to escalate, when to act independently, and when to propose new initiatives\n\r\nNice to Have\n\r\n• Experience in gaming, esports, or audio/consumer electronics industries\n\r\n• Experience with AI chatbot implementation or conversational AI platforms\n\r\n• Background in community management or building brand communities\n\r\n• Familiarity with international ecommerce operations and cross-border customer support\n\r\nWhy SAN Sound?\n\r\n• Build from scratch: You’ll own and shape an entire department—not inherit someone else’s system\n\r\n• AI-forward culture: We embrace AI as a force multiplier, not a threat—you’ll be at the forefront of how support is evolving\n\r\n• Growth trajectory: We’re scaling aggressively across Asian markets with strong funding and ambitious targets\n\r\n• Premium brand: Work with products that people genuinely love in a passionate gaming community\n\r\n• Lean team, real impact: Your work directly shapes the customer experience and the company’s growth\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nSend your resume along with a cover letter on your experience building CS operations and how you’d approach building an AI-powered support department from scratch.

    "description": "\n                    I'm an Australian business owner looking for an experienced Xero bookkeeper with strong knowledge of the Australian tax system to reconcile 18 months of transactions across two separate entities — a partnership (tied to a personal ABN) and a Pty Ltd company. Both entities are GST registered and operate in professional services.\n\r\nThis is a project-based role with a clear path to regular ongoing work if you do a great job.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Scope\n\r\nThe company generates roughly 5–10 transactions per day. The partnership generates 1–3 per day. Neither entity has been reconciled — we're starting from scratch across approximately 18 months. In total you're likely looking at 3,000–5,000+ transactions across both files.\n\r\nYour job is to get both Xero files clean, correctly categorised, and ready for my BAS agent to review and lodge. You do not need to lodge anything yourself.\n\r\n\n\r\nSpecifically you will:\n\r\n\n\r\nReconcile all bank transactions across both Xero entities from the start\n\r\nCategorise expenses to the correct accounts using the right Australian chart of accounts\n\r\nApply correct GST tax codes (GST, GST-free, BAS excluded, input-taxed) to all transactions\n\r\nProactively identify and flag legitimate business expenses that can be claimed — I want to make sure nothing is missed\n\r\nFlag any transactions you're unsure about so I can clarify — I'm available for questions throughout\n\r\nDeliver both files in a state where my BAS agent can go straight to lodgement without cleaning up behind you\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I'm Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nMinimum 3 years experience bookkeeping for Australian clients or working within an Australian accounting firm or BPO\n\r\nDeep understanding of Australian GST — not just how to apply codes, but knowing what's claimable and what isn't for a professional services business\n\r\nXero proficient — bank reconciliation, tax codes, chart of accounts, and working across multiple separate organisations\n\r\nSomeone who works independently but communicates clearly when they have questions\n\r\nDetail-oriented — I'd rather you ask than guess\n\r\n\n\r\nScreening Question — Required\n\r\nApplications without this will not be considered.\n\r\nIn your own words, explain: what is GST, how does it apply to a registered Australian business, and what is a BAS? Also briefly describe how you would approach reconciling a Xero file that has had no reconciliation done from the start.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply Include:\n\r\n\n\r\nYour CV with specific Australian clients or firms you've worked with\n\r\nYour answer to the screening question above\n\r\nYour proposed project rate (fixed fee preferred, or hourly with an estimated total)\n\r\nYour availability and how quickly you could start\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Happens After You Apply\n\r\nShortlisted candidates will be given a small paid test task — approximately 20–30 sample transactions to categorise. This is paid and takes around 30–60 minutes. It's the fastest way for both of us to know if it's a good fit before committing to the full project.\n\r\nStrong performers on this project will be offered regular ongoing bookkeeping work.
