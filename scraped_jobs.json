If you get excited about using Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Bolt, Lovable, Replit, and other AI coding tools to ship real, production-ready marketing apps and automations, this role was made for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT a typical dev job. We don't need someone who spends 3 months planning architecture. We need a builder. \n\r\n\n\r\nSomeone who can take an idea, fire up an AI coding tool, and have a working prototype by end of day. Speed, resourcefulness, and output are everything.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Build\n\r\n\n\r\n- AI-powered copywriting tools - ad copy generators, headline writers, VSL script builders,\n sequence creators\n\r\n- Spy tools and competitive intelligence apps - ad scrapers, offer trackers, landing page analyzers\n\r\n- Campaign automation workflows - connecting APIs, automating repetitive marketing tasks, building dashboards\n\r\n- Creative asset tools - image generators, video editors, thumbnail creators for ads\n\r\n- Lead generation systems - quiz funnels, calculator tools, interactive landing pages\n\r\n- Data tools and calculators - profit predictors, ROI calculators, campaign performance trackers\n\r\n- Internal business tools - CRM integrations, reporting dashboards, member portals\n\r\n- Chrome extensions and browser tools - productivity boosters for media buyers and affiliates\n\r\n\n\r\nMust-Have Skills\n\r\n\n\r\n- Expert-level proficiency with AI coding tools such as Claude (Artifacts and Projects), Cursor, Bolt.new, Lovable, Replit Agent, V0, or similar\n\r\n- Strong fundamentals in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and/or Python. You don't need to be a 10-year senior dev, but you need to understand code well enough to debug, refine, and ship AI-generated output\n\r\n- API integration experience. Comfortable connecting tools via REST APIs, webhooks, and third-party services (Stripe, OpenAI,\n API, tracking platforms, etc.)\n\r\n- Frontend design sense. You can build tools that don't just work, they look professional and clean\n\r\n- Self-starter mentality. You take a brief, figure out the best approach, and deliver without needing hand-holding\n\r\n- Speed and output orientation. You ship fast, iterate quickly, and don't get stuck in analysis paralysis\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have (Not Required)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience with affiliate marketing,\n Ads, or digital advertising\n\r\n- Familiarity with tracking platforms (RedTrack, Voluum, Hyros, ClickMagick)\n\r\n- Experience building Chrome extensions\n\r\n- Knowledge of n8n, \n, or Zapier for workflow automation\n\r\n- Experience with databases (Supabase, Firebase, Airtable, or similar)\n\r\n- Video editing or creative design skills (CapCut, Canva API, FFmpeg)\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're the kind of person who sees a cool marketing tool and immediately thinks \"I could build that.\" You're constantly experimenting with new AI tools. You probably have a folder full of side projects you've built just for fun. You don't wait to be told what to do. You figure it out, build it, and then ask for feedback.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand that in 2025/2026, the game has changed. AI has made it possible for one talented builder to do what used to take an entire dev team. You're riding that wave and getting better every single day.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n- Competitive salary based on experience and output (we pay well for top talent)\n\r\n- Performance bonuses. When you build tools that move the needle, you get rewarded\n\r\n- Full-time, long-term position. This is not a one-off gig, we're building a team\n\r\n- Work directly with the founder. No corporate red tape, no middle management layers\n\r\n- Creative freedom. You'll have real input into what we build and how we build it\n\r\n- Learn cutting-edge marketing. You'll be immersed in a 7-figure affiliate marketing operation and learn skills most developers never get exposed to\n\r\n- Access to premium AI tools. We'll provide subscriptions to whatever you need to do your best work\n\r\n\n\r\nRole Details\n\r\n\n\r\nType: Full-Time (40 hours/week)\n\r\nSchedule: Flexible. We care about output, not clocking hours\n\r\nLocation: Remote (Philippines-based applicants only)\n\r\nStart: ASAP\n\r\nTimezone overlap: Some availability during UK business hours preferred but not required\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nDon't just send a generic resume. We want to see what you can DO. In your application, please include:\n\r\n\n\r\n- A short intro about yourself - who you are, what drives you, and why this role excites you\n\r\n- Your AI coding tool stack - which tools do you use daily? How do you use them?\n\r\n- 2-3 examples of tools or apps you've built - links, screenshots, or demo videos. These don't need to be marketing tools specifically, we just want to see your building ability\n\r\n- A quick Loom or screen recording (optional but HIGHLY encouraged) - walk us through something you've built. Show us your process. This will put you at the top of the pile\n\r\n\n\r\nPRO TIP: If you want to really stand out, build a quick tool or prototype related to digital marketing or advertising and include it in your application. Nothing says \"hire me\" louder than actually showing us what you can do.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe review every application personally. If you're the right fit, you'll hear from us fast.\n\r\n\n\r\nLet's build something incredible together.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Honestly, all these other job postings here sound reallyy dry and boring :D\n\r\n\n\r\nLet me try differently.\n\r\n\n\r\nI don't care about hard skills. I just need someone outgoing and ON FIRE about personal development, who would like to use my App for his/her day-to-day personal development and share the journey online, through all ups and downs :)\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's it.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour win: Well, the salary, of course.\n\r\nYour other win: You'll improve in the areas you would like to improve in, personally - 100% guaranteed.\n\r\nYour other win: You'll learn how to build a personal, authentic brand online. That you may later use for your own business? I'm very happy to help with any experiment of your own.\n\r\nMy win: You become an authentic face of the brand :) Super valuable for growing a community.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE APP (iPhone only)\n\r\nI realized that almost everyone would like to grow as a person, but no one REALLY knows how and where to start.\n\r\nHaving lots of experience in this area, I've built the first proper SYSTEM for personal development - so that literally anyone can start easily and doesn't need to buy an expensive Coach.\n\r\n-> \"Identity - Your Growth System\" in the App Store, just check it out, it's free. Early user feedback (250 users) has been insane!\n\r\n\n\r\nThe App structures this whole journey, gives lots of guidance and makes tracking super intuitive.\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR CONCRETE DELIVERABLES\n\r\n1 Reel per Day.\n\r\nWe iterate between low-effort reels, medium-effort, and high-effort.\n\r\nLow-Effort: Static shot, with single-statement on the screen\n\r\nMedium-Effort: Talking to the camera, sharing some learning/insight/struggle/tips\n\r\nHigh-Effort: \"Day in the Life\" type Reel\n\r\n-> I built a content engine that spits out a lot of ideas/messages, for the days where you don't have something natural to share\n\r\n\n\r\nWAYS OF WORKING\n\r\nNo micro-managing at all. We discuss the goals I have for the channel, and you have full creative freedom. I'm always available to assist with sparring ideas or removing blockers. We do a (paid) weekly feedback call, to discuss what is going good and what can be improved from both sides.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT I'M HOPING FOR\n\r\nThe only thing important for me is that you are an outgoing personality, and that you are really passionate about personal growth. Not necessarily that you're already an expert, but that you would LOVE to become one.\n\r\nSome examples:\n\r\n- reaching fitness goals (gym, calisthenics, pilates, yoga, core workouts, running, ..)\n\r\n- happiness and mindfulness (meditation, breathing, journaling, reducing doomscrolling, ..)\n\r\n- getting a better rhythm (sleeping times, waking times, evening routine, morning routine, ..)\n\r\n- better social life (meeting friends for coffee, organizing a dinner, calling friends/family, ..)\n\r\n- learning/curiosity (reading, podcasts, ..)\n\r\n- creativity (writing, painting, making music, ..)\n\r\n- purpose (side hustle, volunteering, ..)\n\r\n\n\r\nIF YOU HAVE READ UNTIL HERE\n\r\nYou're most likely a good candidate, otherwise you wouldn't have remained interested ;)\n\r\nBegin your application with \"LETS HAVE SOME FUN\", then a small text (2-5 sentences) explaining why you would love to get this job, and what makes you a good fit. End with \"I have an iPhone\" (you must be an iPhone user, because the App is iPhone-only).\n\r\nFeel free to attach any supporting material if you want.\n\r\n\n\r\nKICKOFF\n\r\nTwo paid trial weeks, for both of us to see whether it's a good fit :)                ",

Our chatbots help dentists capture more enquiries and convert more website visitors into paying patients.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe already know that static flow-based chatbots work incredibly well in the dental space — but we’re ready to take things to the next level. That’s why we’re developing a single hybrid chatbot product:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Static flow for high conversion rates (pre-set questions & answer buttons).\n\r\n- AI-powered Q&A mode for free-text questions, using OpenAI integration with strict content boundaries.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis will be the first AI-powered chatbot in the UK dental industry — and you could be the one to help us make it happen.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Project\n\r\n\n\r\nWe want to build a chatbot that has the conversion power of proven static chatbots (like this example: \n), but with the flexibility and wow-factor of AI.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey points about the chatbot:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Opens with 2-3 welcoming messages + clickable buttons for enquiry types.\n\r\n- Static flow determines the conversation for most users (proven to convert well).\n\r\n- AI mode triggers when the user clicks “Ask a question” — AI answers based on uploaded/reference files & prompts (no external data).\n\r\n- The main objective is always to collect lead details (name, contact info, enquiry).\n\r\n- Built as our own in-house solution (not using a subscription service like Quriobot).\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Do\n\r\n\n\r\n- Design & develop our hybrid chatbot from the ground up.\n\r\n- Build an intuitive, engaging static flow-based conversation system.\n\r\n- Integrate AI functionality (OpenAI API) with strict boundary controls for data sources.\n\r\n- Create a back-end system where we can easily manage chatbot flows, AI prompts, and reference files.\n\r\n- Ensure chatbot can be embedded easily into any dental practice website.\n\r\n- Work with our team to refine conversation logic for maximum lead conversion.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSkills & Experience We’re Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n? Proven experience building chatbots (please provide live examples).\n\r\n? Familiarity with static flow conversation logic and AI integration.\n\r\n? Strong knowledge of OpenAI API (including prompt engineering & fine-tuning).\n\r\n? Proficiency in web technologies: JavaScript, HTML, CSS.\n\r\n? Experience with backend frameworks (Node.js, Python, or similar).\n\r\n? Knowledge of database management (MySQL, MongoDB, or similar).\n\r\n? Understanding of data privacy & security best practices.\n\r\n? UX/UI sensibility — you can make the chatbot look sleek and user-friendly.\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Skills (Nice to Have):\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience in SaaS product development.\n\r\n- Experience embedding chat widgets across different CMS platforms (WordPress, Wix, etc.).\n\r\n- Knowledge of dental or healthcare industries.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n- Competitive salary based on experience.\n\r\n- Flexible working hours (we care about results, not clock-watching).\n\r\n- Opportunity to lead development of a first-to-market product in the UK dental sector.\n\r\n- Long-term work potential if the project goes well.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease send:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. A short intro about yourself and your relevant experience.\n\r\n2. Links to chatbots you have built (with a short explanation of how each was created).\n\r\n3. A proposed project plan & estimated timescale for building our hybrid chatbot.\n\r\n\n\r\nSend applications via OnlineJobs.ph — we’re excited to see your skills in action.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Luxury Shopify Website Redesign & Custom Features\n\r\n\n\r\nI am the owner of Timeless Fits, a luxury fashion brand selling both new and second-hand clothing. We operate through an existing Shopify online store and a large physical boutique in the Netherlands, which customers can visit by appointment only.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis project is not a dropshipping store and not a basic template build. The website already performs well, but I am looking for a high-end redesign and functional expansion to elevate the brand, improve navigation, and strengthen the overall luxury experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nWebsite:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nBrand & Vision\n\r\n\n\r\nTimeless Fits should feel like a premium fashion destination, comparable to platforms such as Farfetch.\n\r\n\n\r\nAlthough we sell second-hand items, the overall experience must:\n\r\n • Feel luxurious, curated, and exclusive\n\r\n • Avoid any “thrift store” or marketplace appearance\n\r\n • Emphasize quality, styling, and presentation\n\r\n\n\r\nThe design should be clean, minimal, editorial, and fashion-forward, with strong typography, generous white space, and a heavy focus on professional photography.\n\r\nAll photography is already available and can be reused.\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nScope of Work\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Homepage Redesign (Main Focus)\n\r\n • Redesign the homepage for clearer structure and navigation\n\r\n • Guide visitors quickly and intuitively to what they are looking for\n\r\n • Create a strong first impression based on trust and luxury\n\r\n • Clearly highlight:\n\r\n • The online shop\n\r\n • The physical store (appointment-only)\n\r\n • The Sell2Us concept\n\r\n\n\r\n2.

Sell2Us – Custom Resale Feature\n\r\n\n\r\nA key part of this project is integrating a custom feature called Sell2Us, allowing customers to sell their own clothing to Timeless Fits.\n\r\n\n\r\nProcess:\n\r\n 1. Customers upload photos of their item\n\r\n 2. They receive an initial price estimate based on the photos\n\r\n 3. The customer ships the item to us\n\r\n 4.

    "description": "\n                    We're not looking for someone who waits to be told what to do.\n\r\nThe Melody Manager Agency is hiring Executive Virtual Assistants, and we want to be upfront: this is not a typical VA role, and we are not a typical agency.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe work with purpose-driven American female entrepreneurs, women who are building businesses that matter and who need a real thinking partner in their corner. Not someone who completes tasks and logs out. Someone who actually gets it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho this is for\n\r\nYou have 5 or more years of professional experience. Maybe in BPO, corporate support, executive assistance, operations, customer success Management, or project coordination. The title matters less than what you actually did.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand American culture on a real level. You're comfortable with direct communication. You get the humor. You know that \"this is fine\" sometimes means it's not fine, and you know how to navigate that. You've worked with American clients or in American-facing roles, and you didn't just survive it, you thrived.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are not a task-doer. You are a problem-solver. You anticipate what's coming before your client sees it. You follow up without being asked. You protect your client's time like it's your own. And when something isn't working, you say so, professionally and clearly, instead of just quietly struggling.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho this is not for\n\r\nIf you're looking for a role where you wait for instructions and complete a checklist, this is not the right fit. Our clients are busy, sometimes intense, and need someone who can think independently. If excessive formality is your comfort zone, or if you've never really worked closely with Americans, this will be a difficult adjustment. We'd rather be honest about that now.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you'll do\n\r\nManage calendars, inboxes, and communication for your client. Keep projects organized and moving. Anticipate needs before they're spoken. Protect your client's time and energy. Show up as a real partner, not just support staff. Handle direct feedback without shutting down. And bring enough steadiness that your client can finally focus on the work only she can do.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we offer\n\r\nStarting at $8 USD per hour, negotiated based on your experience, because we only hire people we're willing to compensate fairly. Health insurance. Quarterly performance bonuses. Earned PTO. Monthly training and real support from our team. And a \"No Jerks Allowed\" policy written into every client contract. You will never be disrespected in this role. We protect our people, and we mean that.\n\r\nWhat we're looking for in your application\n\r\n\n\r\n5+ years of professional experience in a role that required real judgment and independent thinking. Strong written and spoken English. Genuine familiarity with American business culture. And someone who is motivated by doing excellent work, not just by getting through the day.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf most of this sounds like you, don't talk yourself out of applying. The person I'm looking for probably won't feel 100% ready. Apply anyway.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication form: \n\r\nCODE: HSVAMM1 \n\r\n\n\r\n***Beacuse we get a lot of applications every day, only application that go through the link above are processed. Please make sure to course your application through that forma nd you'll be\ned by our team on next steps.                ",

Our CaniCol model tests many products every month using strict rules and lean budgets. Creatives are the main fuel.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are hiring one dedicated video editor to turn existing assets into short-form ads for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work only with existing footage, b-roll, product clips, images, reviews, ad library downloads, and AI tools. Your goal is to produce 100 ads per month that give us enough shots on goal to find winning products.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is ideal if you like high-output work, clear targets, and long-term stability.\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT US AND THE CANICOL MODEL\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run a lean, volume-based dropshipping system. We test many products each month and make decisions fast based on data.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur model focuses on:\n\r\nFast product testing with controlled budgets\n\r\nHigh volume of creatives per product\n\r\nClear kill, pass, and scale rules\n\r\nAccepting some false negatives in exchange for more total tests\n\r\n\n\r\nYour edits plug directly into this engine. Your ads are what we run in Phase 1 and Phase 2 tests. When a product reaches validated status using your creatives, you earn a bonus. This aligns your work with our real goal: validated products and profitable campaigns.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe work with Slack, ClickUp or Notion, and Google Drive. You will receive clear briefs and assets, and we will give feedback based on real ad performance such as hook rate and click through rate.\n\r\n\n\r\nMAIN RESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will edit 100 short-form video ads per month. Each video is usually 15 to 35 seconds, vertical 9:16 format, for TikTok, Reels, and Shorts.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work only from existing assets. Examples include competitor ads from TikTok and Meta Ad Libraries, supplier or manufacturer videos, product b-roll, product photos, customer reviews, screenshots, stock clips, and AI generated or AI assisted clips.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will create multiple variations from the same base assets. This means trying different hooks in the first 1 to 3 seconds, different scene order and pacing, and different angles and calls to action.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will add strong direct response elements. This includes clear on screen text, readable subtitles, benefit driven captions, problem and solution framing, social proof, and urgency when appropriate.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will export files correctly and keep all files named and organized following our structure in Google Drive.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will make fast revisions when we see what is working and what is not. When a product shows good signals, we will ask you for more variations quickly so we can push it through the CaniCol gates.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED SKILLS\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have experience editing short-form vertical videos for platforms such as TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be able to edit using at least one of the following: CapCut, Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or DaVinci Resolve.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must understand pacing and hooks. You know that the first 1 to 3 seconds d\n whether people keep watching or scroll.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be comfortable working completely from existing footage and from AI tools. This is an editing and repurposing role, not a filming role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be able to create clean subtitles and on-screen text in clear English.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have a reliable computer and stable internet connection that can handle video editing work.\n\r\n\n\r\nSOFT SKILLS WE VALUE\n\r\n\n\r\nYou follow instructions very carefully and care about details such as file names and structure.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou hit deadlines and weekly output targets without needing to be chased.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are open to direct feedback and can adjust your style based on performance data and comments.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou ask questions when something is unclear instead of guessing and wasting time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou want a long-term, stable role and are not just looking for a quick project.\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION AND GROWTH\n\r\n\n\r\nPay is 150USD per month retainer in exchange for 80 edited short-form ads for the first month. After proven, retainer will increase.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou also receive a 50 USD bonus for each validated product. A product is considered validated when campaigns using your creatives hit our internal performance targets over several days at proper ad spend. We will share these rules clearly in writing so you know exactly what has to happen for a product to count as validated.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs your creatives help us find more winning products, we will review your base pay and bonus structure. There is potential for higher pay and for you to become a lead editor in the future.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe pay on time and review performance regularly.\n\r\n\n\r\nWORK SCHEDULE AND SETUP\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a part-time, long-term, remote role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can set your own schedule as long as you consistently deliver your weekly output and can overlap at least 2 to 3 hours with US Eastern Time on agreed days for feedback calls or messages.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will use Slack for communication, Google Drive for assets and exports, and ClickUp or Notion for tasks. You will use your own editing software.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nOnlineJobs.ph subject line requirement:\n\r\n\n\r\nUse this exact subject line when you apply:\n\r\nBLUE – Short-Form Ads Video Editor\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the body of your application, include the following in plain text:\n\r\n\n\r\nFirst, a short introduction of 3 to 5 sentences. Tell us who you are, your experience with short-form ads, and why a high volume, repurposing focused role like this fits you.\n\r\n\n\r\nSecond, links to 3 to 6 examples of your work. These should be vertical short-form videos. Ad style edits are preferred. You can send Google Drive links, TikTok or Instagram profiles, or YouTube links. If any of these performed well in terms of views or sales, mention that.\n\r\n\n\r\nThird, answer these questions in simple text:\n\r\nWhat editing software do you use every day?\n\r\nHow many 15 to 30 second ads can you realistically edit in a full working day at good quality?\n\r\nHave you worked with ecommerce, dropshipping, or DTC brands before? If yes, what did you do?\n\r\nHave you used TikTok or Meta Ad Library before to study or repurpose ads?\n\r\nAre you comfortable with 150$ per month base pay plus 50 USD per validated product and an output of 80-100 ads per month?\n\r\n\n\r\nFourth, describe your setup. Write your computer specs including CPU, RAM, and GPU if you have one. Also tell us your internet speed. You can paste your speedtest result if you want.\n\r\n\n\r\nFifth, optional but a big plus. You may send a 1 to 2 minute Loom or unlisted YouTube video where you show one ad you edited and explain how you built the hook, the middle, and the call to action.\n\r\n\n\r\nHIRING PROCESS\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will first review applications that follow all instructions and use the correct subject line.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will then shortlist candidates based on portfolio, clarity of answers, and fit for a high-volume testing environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nShortlisted candidates will be invited to a paid test project using our assets.\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter the test project, we will choose one editor for a one month paid trial. If both sides are happy after the trial, we will continue on a long-term basis.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want a long-term, data driven editing role where your work is directly tied to validated products and bonuses, we invite you to apply.

    "description": "\n                    About the Role\n\r\nI run a portfolio of four companies across branding, defence advisory, healthcare infrastructure, and software/AI. I need a sharp, self-directed VA to own the operational layer of business development across all four. This is not a data entry role. You will be the engine behind LinkedIn outreach, CRM pipeline management, meeting coordination,\n drafting, cold outreach campaigns, and research. You will work directly with me and my PA.\n\r\nI use AI tools (Claude) extensively and expect you to as well. If you've never used AI tools in your workflow, this isn't the right fit. If you've used them and found they make you faster and better, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Do Every Day\n\r\n- Build targeted prospect lists using Claude AI and research tools, then execute LinkedIn outreach under my account (with strict safety protocols).\n\r\n- Manage our Airtable CRM: create origination entries, move contacts through the pipeline, coordinate with my PA on meeting scheduling, and create deals when opportunities arise.\n\r\n- Draft\ns and follow-ups in my voice and tone. You'll be trained on my writing style and expected to match it closely.\n\r\n - Run structured cold outreach campaigns end-to-end: list building, template drafting, sending, tracking, and follow-up sequences.\n\r\n- Deliver daily output logs with specific activity numbers. No tracking software. Your outputs speak for themselves.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I Need From You\n\r\n- Proven VA experience supporting a founder, CEO, or senior executive. Not a team. Not a department. A person who moves fast and expects you to keep up.\n\r\n- Airtable proficiency (or the ability to learn it in days, not weeks). If you've built automations in Airtable before, say so. If you haven't but you've done similar work in \n, HubSpot, or another CRM, that counts.\n\r\n- LinkedIn outreach experience. You understand connection limits, the importance of VPN/dedicated IP, and how to write messages that don't sound like spam.\n\r\n- Strong written English. Not perfect grammar for the sake of it. I need you to write\ns that sound like a real person, not a template. Warm, direct, professional.\n\r\n- AI tool literacy. You use ChatGPT, Claude, or similar tools proactively in your work. Bonus if you've used Claude's Co-Worker/Projects features.\n\r\n- Judgment. You know the difference between something you can handle yourself, something you should flag, and something that needs to be escalated immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I Need From You\n\r\n- Proven VA experience supporting a founder, CEO, or senior executive.

Instead, reply with the following:\n\r\n- Your name and a one-paragraph summary of the most relevant VA role you've held. Specifically tell me: who you supported (founder/CEO/team), what tools you used daily, and one example of a task you owned end-to-end without needing to be managed.\n\r\n- Rate your Airtable proficiency from 1 to 10 and explain your rating in one sentence.\n\r\n- Rate your LinkedIn outreach experience from 1 to 10 and explain your rating in one sentence.\n\r\n- Have you used Claude AI (by Anthropic) before? If yes, describe one task you used it for. If no, that's fine, but say so.\n\r\nInclude the phrase \"I read the full posting\" at the very start of your application, before anything else.

This role is focused entirely on outbound communication and opportunity generation. Your main responsibility is to identify, contact, and secure collaborations with content creators who can produce high-quality user generated content for our brand.

You will be working inside live production systems that affect lead flow, bookings, and revenue across a real franchise network.\n\r\n\n\r\nAt Transform Hub, we care about people, and that extends to the people who work for us.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a chance to work alongside the Head of Tech and the CEO of a booming fitness franchise.

You keep our numbers clean so decisions are based on reality, not guesses.\n\r\n\n\r\nExamples:\n\r\n\n\r\nCheck that all key metrics are flowing correctly from GoHighLevel into Google Sheets / dashboards (leads, booked calls, show-ups, sales, cancels, churn).\n\r\n\n\r\nManually update or correct data when automations miss something (fixing stages, tags, sources, owners, etc.).\n\r\n\n\r\nRun daily and weekly “sanity checks” to spot problems early (e.g. a site suddenly shows 0 leads today, pipeline totals look wrong, a formula is broken).\n\r\n\n\r\nMaintain clear, documented definitions for every KPI so reporting is consistent across all locations.\n\r\n\n\r\nPrepare simple weekly summary reports for leadership and franchisees.\n\r\nWork with tools like \n (we can train you) to keep reporting flows reliable.\n\r\n\n\r\nPriority 1 – Franchisee Support & Troubleshooting (Daily)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are the first point of contact when something breaks or looks wrong.\n\r\n\n\r\nReal examples:\n\r\nA franchisee reports that automated follow-up messages have stopped sending.\n\r\nThe AI booking bot is not adding appointments to the correct calendar.\n\r\nLeads are receiving duplicate or overlapping automated messages even after staff have replied.\n\r\nBooking confirmations are going out with the wrong location or coach name.\n\r\nA workflow that was working last week has silently broken.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will:\n\r\n\n\r\nCheck workflow execution logs and trigger conditions.\n\r\nReproduce the problem in a controlled way.\n\r\nFind the root cause, not just describe the symptom.\n\r\nTest your fix safely before pushing it live.\n\r\n\n\r\nPriority 2 – Workflow & Automation Management (Regular)\n\r\n\n\r\nCreate and edit workflows and automations.\n\r\nManage pipelines, stages, and opportunity flows.\n\r\nBuild and maintain forms, surveys, calendars, and basic landing pages.\n\r\nSet up and edit SMS,\n, and WhatsApp templates.\n\r\nManage contacts and bulk actions carefully (no “oops, I messaged 10,000 people by mistake”).\n\r\n\n\r\nPriority 3 – Account Setup & Systems (As Needed)\n\r\n\n\r\nSet up new franchise sub-accounts from snapshots.\n\r\nManage snapshots and sub-account configurations.\n\r\nHandle basic webhook setup inside GoHighLevel.\n\r\nLiaise with GoHighLevel support when needed and follow through to resolution.\n\r\n\n\r\nTools You Will Use\n\r\n\n\r\nGoHighLevel (core of the role – required)\n\r\nGoogle Sheets (daily for reporting and checks)\n\r\nSlack (team communication)\n\r\nCanva (basic asset tweaks)\n\r\nGHL calendars and booking systems\n\r\nAI tools (e.g. ChatGPT) to speed up your work without reducing quality\n\r\nBonus: \n and CloseBot experience\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Type of Person We Want\n\r\n\n\r\nThis matters more than your tool list.\n\r\n\n\r\nGreen Flags\n\r\n\n\r\n- You check workflow execution history before asking what went wrong.\n\r\n- You test a fix in a controlled way before pushing it live.\n\r\n- You proactively flag issues you spot before anyone reports them.\n\r\n- You explain why something broke, not just what you changed.\n\r\n- You are comfortable saying, “I need to check this before I change anything.”\n\r\n- You notice when numbers don’t look right in a report and go dig.\n\r\n\n\r\nRed Flags\n\r\n\n\r\n- You guess or change settings without understanding the impact.\n\r\n- You say “done” without testing.\n\r\n- You need to be told what to look at every time something breaks.\n\r\n- You avoid taking ownership when something goes wrong.\n\r\n- You are not available during UK working hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience Required\n\r\n\n\r\nProven experience using GoHighLevel in a live, production environment.\n\r\nExperience supporting multiple accounts or locations is strongly preferred.\n\r\nStrong Google Sheets skills (lookups, filters, pivots, error checking).\n\r\nComfortable learning new tools and adapting to evolving systems.\n\r\nDetail-oriented, reliable, and calm when things break.\n\r\nStrong written English – you will communicate directly with franchisees (business owners, not tech people).\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n\n\r\n$1,200–$1,500 USD per month, depending on experience\n\r\nPerformance-based increases\n\r\nLong-term role with room to grow for the right person\n\r\n\n\r\nHiring Process & How To Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nWritten Application\n\r\nIn your application, please include:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n- A short summary of your GoHighLevel experience (what you actually did, not just “used it”).\n\r\n- A link to a Google Sheet dashboard or report you have built or maintained.
