You have direct, working experience with Pacvue and can hit the ground running without a learning curve. You're comfortable inside Amazon Seller Central and the advertising console, and you understand keyword research, bid strategy, search term harvesting, and negative keyword management deeply. You can build and maintain weekly performance reports in Excel or Google Sheets that are clean and easy to understand.

This is the most critical function of the role.\n\r\n•\tMeeting & Leadership Support — Prepare agendas and pre-reads, capture minutes and action items, track accountability, and ensure Directors have what they need ahead of key meetings.\n\r\n•\tFinancial & Reporting Support — Revenue summaries, targets vs actuals, invoice follow-up, department dashboards, and budget tracking across Xero and Google Sheets.\n\r\n•\tCRM & Systems — Keep CRM data clean, manage job management platforms, maintain SOPs, and support system migrations and process documentation.\n\r\n•\tSales & Client Support — Draft proposals and pitch decks, track pipeline activity, prepare client-facing collateral, and research new business opportunities.\n\r\n•\tOperations & Production — Coordinate suppliers, track SLAs, follow up on production deadlines, and manage vendor databases.\n\r\n•\tMarketing & Content — Schedule social content, draft LinkedIn posts for the GM, repurpose internal content into external thought leadership, and research competitor positioning.\n\r\n•\tTravel & Personal Admin — Book travel (domestic and international), manage personal appointments, coordinate household admin, handle remote errands, and manage subscriptions.\n\r\n•\tAI & Automation — Use Claude, ChatGPT, Zapier, and similar tools to accelerate workflows, automate repeatable processes, and continuously improve efficiency.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’re Looking For\n\r\n•\t3+ years as an EA or VA supporting a senior leader\n\r\n•\tExceptional written and verbal English — you’ll be writing as the GM\n\r\n•\tStrong commercial awareness and ability to understand business context quickly\n\r\n•\tHighly organised with relentless follow-through and attention to detail\n\r\n•\tProactive problem-solver who fixes things before anyone notices\n\r\n•\tComfortable managing up — you’ll hold leadership accountable, diplomatically\n\r\n•\tTech-fluent across Google Workspace, Slack, CRM, and project management tools\n\r\n•\tAvailable to work Australian business hours (AEST/AEDT)\n\r\n•\tDiscreet and trustworthy with confidential information\n\r\n\n\r\nYou Are\n\r\n•\tProactive — you anticipate needs and act before being asked\n\r\n•\tAn owner — you treat leadership priorities as your own\n\r\n•\tEmotionally intelligent — you read situations and adapt with discretion\n\r\n•\tRelentless — zero dropped balls, ever\n\r\n•\tResourceful — you find solutions before escalating\n\r\n•\tPremium — you take pride in polished, high-quality work\n\r\n\n\r\nHow We’ll Measure Success\n\r\n•\tGM’s inbox at zero unactioned items daily\n\r\n•\tAll action items tracked and followed up within 24 hours\n\r\n•\tZero missed deadlines across executive and Director priorities\n\r\n•\tWeekly reporting delivered on time, every time\n\r\n•\tDepartment follow-ups executed without prompting\n\r\n•\tGM operating in a full CEO capacity within 90 days\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nSubmit your resume/CV and a brief cover letter or Loom video explaining why you’re the right fit.

    "description": "\n                    WHO WE ARE\n\r\nCandor Marketing is a nationally focused agency that builds predictable patient pipelines exclusively for aesthetic and wellness clinics. We don't sell marketing services — we sell outcomes. We guarantee results, we operate on documented systems, and we build everything on the Hormozi framework: make the offer so good that saying no feels stupid, deliver so much value that clients never want to leave, and build systems that scale without depending on any one person.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe hire specialists. Not generalists. If you're the best at what you do and you want to be part of building a nationally recognized brand, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE ROLE\n\r\nYou are the engine behind every client account. You build and manage the complete GoHighLevel infrastructure that turns ad clicks into booked appointments — automatically, reliably, and at a standard that makes our clients feel like they have a world-class tech team in their corner.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a builder role. You own the system.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\nBuild and manage all client GoHighLevel sub-accounts including pipelines, automations, SMS and\n follow-up sequences, reactivation campaigns, reputation management workflows, and live reporting dashboards.\n\r\n\n\r\nConnect all client landing pages — built externally in Webflow, Lovable, or ClickFunnels — to GoHighLevel so every form submission triggers the correct pipeline stage, automation sequence, and contact record instantly and accurately.\n\r\nBuild automated follow-up sequences that convert leads into booked appointments without any manual effort from the clinic. Every sequence needs to feel human, move with urgency, and reflect the value-dense Hormozi style offer the client is running.\n\r\nRun patient reactivation campaigns into existing client databases every 60 days — segmented, sequenced, and built to generate found revenue with zero ad spend.\n\r\n\n\r\nBuild and maintain real-time dashboards every client can check from their phone showing exactly what their investment is producing. No vanity metrics. Revenue, leads, booked appointments, cost per acquisition.\n\r\nDocument every workflow, automation, and system you build in our SOP library. If you get hit by a bus tomorrow, someone else can run your accounts by end of day. That's the standard.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU NEED\n\r\nMinimum 2 years of hands-on GoHighLevel experience with complex multi-step automations and full sub-account builds.

    "description": "\n                    I have a pickleball coaching company called The Pickleball Lab: pickleballlab.co - and I am looking for a new editor, visual graphics editor and junior level graphic designer. My old editor had to resign due to personal reasons.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur main revenue focus is on our coaching platform - \n (look at it in desktop, mobile is a work in progress). It's a place where people who want to get better at pickleball can come and take our online courses, get direct coaching fro\n, and participate in a community of other pickleball players all trying to get better.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is where you pick up.\n\r\n\n\r\nMy editor has 4 main roles:\n\r\n\n\r\n1) Edit instructional videos for the The Pickleball Lab platform\n\r\n2) Edit videos for YouTube/Social (and create any graphic design elements needing to be animated) - things like instructional videos, our podcast, etc.\n\r\n3) Odd and end editing work like - put together b roll segments so when we need b roll we can go through and pick out what we need, edit social video ads I create and shoot for you, put together b roll of pro film to help me get better as a pickleball player, etc. (basically all the skills needed for 1 and 2 above, just different use cases)\n\r\n4) Odd and end graphic design like editing photos, creating basic thumbnails, creating different logo color schemes of our already existing logo, AI photo generation, etc. Basically any junior level graphic design work, any senior level graphic design work like logo creation, t shirt design creation, etc. I hire out to a senior level graphic designer. This work is relatively uncommon compared to the editing work but it does happen so you need to be prepared to be a team player on this.\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd while the main revenue focus is the platform, editing videos is pretty easy. There's hardly any visual graphic work necessary. It's literally just simple video editing ie cutting the video together, and adding the intro.\n\r\n\n\r\nYouTube is where you're really going to flex your editing skills, because our YT channel is where the main visual graphic work comes in. If you can't do visual graphic work in AE, this is not the job for you, as mentioned. Your base proficiency in editing should be the ability create this entire video on your own:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nOur YT videos are heavy visual graphic editing as you can tell. If you can't do all of this visual graphic work, do not apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you can, continue to read below:\n\r\n\n\r\nI've been doing this for 2 years now and we've had to make some pivots long the way. Our first goal was to just get our youtube channel up and running. Then we deviated from that for me to start doing local coaching. That went well and we grew into the online platform. This online platform took a lot of time to get up and running. We have (if I remember correctly) over 40 videos in there now. The platform has essentially no paying members yet, which is to be expected. We've just started more or less. But we do have around 20 members, most are not active. We're a work in progress.\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, your job will be a mix of helping edit the content I shoot for the platform and then helping me build the brand via YT and social video marketing, with that heavy emphasis on visual graphic work.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you play pickleball or even tennis or ping pong, that is an added bonus. It will make the edits that much better. You'll understand more and know what to do to make the video a high quality video. But if you don't, that's certainly not required. A good visual graphics editor is a good visual graphics editor.\n\r\n \n\r\nFull time starting at $1,100 - $1,600 USD a month and can go up based on experience.\n\r\n \n\r\nAgain, I have to stress this, if you do not have extensive experience in adobe after effects or a similar motion graphic creator, please do not apply. I keep getting applications from people who can't do this high level of editing. I am looking for good visuals that will need to be done in AE or similar. Also, you will need great graphic design to create a lot of these assets. So, if you can't do this as well, please do not apply.\n\r\n \n\r\nWhen you apply send me:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Monthly fee you require for full time\n\r\n\n\r\n2. How many hours does \"full time\" mean to you? 40, 60, etc.?\n\r\n\n\r\n3. At full time, how many YouTube videos (with heavy graphic work like the example I gave you) can you edit a month? (each video will be 5 - 12 minutes on average as well as a thumbnail created)\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Are you open to doing a 1 minute test project so I can see your skills? You may watermark the video.\n\r\n \n\r\n5. Do you play pickleball, tennis, ping pong or any other sports?\n\r\n \n\r\n6. Look at our video again: \n - can you do this type of visual graphic work?\n\r\n \n\r\n7. Do you have extensive experience in Adobe After Effects or motion graphics software? If so, detail your experience here. If not, please do not apply.\n\r\n \n\r\n8. Send me 1-2 videos with your best motion graphic work in AE or similar.\n\r\n \n\r\n9. Why do you think you'd be a good fit for this project?\n\r\n \n\r\n10. Any other information you think would be helpful\n\r\n \n\r\nLooking forward to speaking with you!                ",

Our AWS bill is sitting at $4,500/month – and we know it shouldn't be anywhere near that. We need someone who can come in, audit the whole setup, and actually fix it. Not just give us a report that sits in a folder.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe've already been through a few candidates who talked a big game but couldn't execute. We're done with that. If you're the type who needs handholding or can't work independently, this isn't for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Actually Do\n\r\n- Audit our entire AWS infrastructure and identify exactly where we're wasting money (we expect significant savings)\n\r\n- Optimize our Kubernetes clusters – right-size nodes, fix resource requests/limits, implement autoscaling that actually works\n\r\n- Implement cost controls: Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, spot instances where appropriate, and cleanup of orphaned resources\n\r\n- Set up monitoring and alerts so costs don't creep back up without us knowing\n\r\n- Document everything you do so the team can maintain it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHard Requirements (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n- 3+ years hands-on Kubernetes experience in production environments – EKS specifically preferred\n\r\n- Deep AWS knowledge: EC2, EKS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor\n\r\n- Proven track record of actually reducing AWS costs (be ready to share numbers/percentages)\n\r\n- Strong scripting skills (Python, Bash) for automation\n\r\n- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform or CloudFormation (Terraform preferred)\n\r\n- Self-starter who can take ownership and execute without constant oversight\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n!!!!CRITICAL: This Role Requires Surgical Precision\n\r\nThis is production infrastructure running live systems. Think of this like surgery – one wrong move can take everything down.\n\r\n- NO cowboy moves. You don't delete, modify, or remove anything without a clear plan first.\n\r\n- Every change must be planned out, documented, and confirmed with the CEO before execution.\n\r\n- Extreme attention to detail. You double-check and triple-check before touching anything.\n\r\n- If you're not 100% sure what something does, you ask first. You don't assume.\n\r\n- Methodical execution only. We value careful and correct over fast and reckless.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong Plus\n\r\n- Experience with blockchain/Web3 infrastructure\n\r\n- Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, or KEDA experience\n\r\n-  AWS certifications (Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer)\n\r\n- Experience with FinOps tools (Kubecost, CloudHealth, \n)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Need In Your Application\n\r\nDon't send a generic application. We will ignore it. Include:\n\r\n- Specific examples of AWS cost optimization you've done – what was the setup, what did you change, what % did you save?\n\r\n- Your Kubernetes experience – cluster sizes you've managed, scaling strategies you've implemented\n\r\n- Your availability and timezone (we need someone who can overlap with US business hours for some calls)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Structure\n\r\n- $20-25/hour based on experience and proven results\n\r\n- 20 hours/week to start – potential for more hours for the right person\n\r\n- Fully remote\n\r\n- Initial project: Comprehensive audit + implementation plan with clear cost reduction targets\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're someone who can actually deliver results and not just talk about them – we want to hear from you. Show us what you've done.                ",

Our mission is to take the \"clinical\" out of health and replace it with a brand experience that feels grounded, earthy, and trustworthy.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role is Different\n\r\nI have found that many designers can learn the technical \"how-to\" of a platform, but they lack a true creative design eye. I am looking for someone who:\n\r\n\n\r\nMasters the Muted Aesthetic: Our industry rarely uses bright, neon, or high-contrast \"tech\" colors.

AI-generated applications that simply \"parrot\" back the requirements of this ad will be immediately disregarded. I want to hear your actual voice and see your unique perspective on design.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nPlease send through your portfolio. I am specifically looking for:\n\r\n\n\r\nExamples of work that demonstrate a soft, organic, or minimal aesthetic.\n\r\n\n\r\nA brief note telling me about a brand (in any industry) whose visual aesthetic you absolutely love and why it works.

You won't be building strategy. Our team handles that. You also won't be starting from scratch on most tasks. We use AI tools to draft copy, generate code snippets, and create step-by-step implementation plans. \n\r\n\n\r\nYour job is to take those plans, execute them in the platform (Shopify or Klaviyo), QA the work, and make sure everything is correct before it goes live.\n\r\n\n\r\nThink of it this way: you'll get a detailed set of instructions that says \"here's exactly what to change, here's the code, here's where it goes.\" You follow those instructions, verify everything looks right on desktop and mobile, and flag anything that seems off.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe work spans two main platforms:\n\r\n\n\r\nShopify (about 60% of the work):\n\r\n\n\r\nEditing product pages: updating headlines, images, benefit copy, and section ordering in the theme editor\n\r\nHomepage layout changes: reordering sections, updating hero banners, simplifying navigation\n\r\nSetting up bundles, quantity breaks, and discount codes\n\r\nConfiguring apps like post-purchase upsell tools, lead capture popups, and heatmap tracking\n\r\nCheckout optimizations: enabling express pay options, adjusting form fields, adding trust badges\n\r\nBuilding landing pages using page builder tools or theme sections\n\r\nMaking small Liquid/HTML edits in the theme editor when given the exact code to paste\n\r\nPrice and shipping threshold updates\n\r\nQA-ing all changes on mobile and desktop before anything goes live\n\r\n\n\r\nKlaviyo (about 40% of the work):\n\r\n\n\r\nReviewing and QA-ing\n templates that our AI tools have drafted (checking links, images, mobile rendering, copy accuracy)\n\r\nWiring\n flows in Klaviyo (abandoned checkout, welcome series, post-purchase, winback): connecting templates to triggers and setting timing\n\r\nSetting up campaigns and scheduling sends\n\r\nEntering weekly performance metrics into our tracking system\n\r\nBasic list hygiene and segment management\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we're looking for:\n\r\n\n\r\nReal experience working inside Shopify admin and the theme editor. You know where things are and you're not afraid to make changes.\n\r\n\n\r\nHands-on experience with Klaviyo (building flows, creating campaigns, working with templates)\n\r\nComfortable following detailed written instructions to make changes you haven't done before\n\r\nStrong attention to detail. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou're the last check before changes go live to real customers paying real money.\n\r\nComfortable with basic HTML/CSS. You don't need to write code from scratch, but you should be able to paste a code snippet into the right place and understand what it's doing.\n\r\n\n\r\nReliable communication and follow-through. We work async and need to trust that tasks get done on schedule.\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to have but not required:\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with Shopify apps (Rebuy, Privy, \n, \n, \n, Intelligems, Zipify)\n\r\nExperience with Google Analytics or Meta Ads Manager\n\r\nExperience with page builders (Shogun, GemPages, or similar)\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a full-time role, approximately 40 hours per week.

You are thrilled by the idea of a lifetime job opportunity instead of applying for 100 new jobs every 6 months. \n\r\n\n\r\nRead these carefully - if this sounds like you, you’re who we want:\n\r\n\n\r\n• You love speaking with people - idea of encouraging tenants to renew their lease or confidently talking with new applicants about why they should choose our homes actually energizes you.\n\r\n• You’re calm, patient, and solution-focused under pressure - when you receive calls about issues, your natural instinct is to resolve, not get flustered.\n\r\n• You speak exceptional English with a clear voice and minimal accent - the kind that U.S.-based callers can easily understand on the phone.\n\r\n• You are resourceful and skilled at problem solving, able to think on your feet, and naturally good at handling unexpected or challenging situations.\n\r\n• You consider yourself highly intelligent - the type of person others rely on when something tricky needs solving.\n\r\n• You have prior work-from-home experience and know how to manage yourself independently.\n\r\n• You have a proven history of staying with past employers (ideally 2 years or more).\n\r\n• You want stable, long-term, full-time employment and value security over chasing short-term high pay that disappears.\n\r\nIf this is you authentically - not aspirationally - we want to meet you (even if you haven’t worked in Property Management before).\n\r\n_____________________________\n\r\n\n\r\nUS (THE COMPANY):\n\r\n• We are a U.S. based long-term rental property company - not Airbnb, not short-term rentals.\n\r\n• We currently manage 100+ houses and are growing quickly.\n\r\n• We expect to reach another 100–200 homes in the next two years.\n\r\n• We value ladies who want long-term stability with us - 10 years, not 10 months.\n\r\n_____________________________\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMMITMENT FROM YOU:\n\r\n • Full-time (40 hours/week)\n\r\n • Availability: Monday–Friday, 7 AM–7 PM Pacific Time | Active working hours occur within that window\n\r\n • This is a long-term, secure role for someone who wants to grow with us at $700-$1000 Monthly (Based on Experience) + Bonuses\n\r\n_____________________________\n\r\n\n\r\nApply Here: \n\r\nOLJ Applications or OLJ Messages will not be reviewed.

We're looking for a data-savvy Marketing Strategist who knows how to turn ad spend into real results — not just clicks, but booked appointments and closed pipelines.\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\nThe Marketing Strategist at HelloAi is responsible for researching, planning, and executing paid and organic advertising strategies for HelloAi and its clients. Your north star metric is booked appointments — every campaign you build should move the needle toward a filled calendar and a growing client base. You won't just be launching ads. You'll be studying what works, why it works, and how to replicate it across different industries and audiences. You'll be a key voice in how HelloAi and its clients show up in the market.\n\r\nWhat You'll Do\n\r\n\n\r\nResearch target audiences, competitors, and industry trends before recommending any ad strategy\n\r\nBuild and manage paid ad campaigns across platforms such as Meta, Google, LinkedIn, and others relevant to the client's audience\n\r\nDevelop clear and detailed creative briefs for our in-house design team to bring your ad concepts to life\n\r\nCollaborate closely with our designers to ensure the final creative aligns with the strategy and is optimized for conversions\n\r\nSet up and monitor tracking, analytics, and reporting to evaluate campaign performance\n\r\nContinuously test, optimize, and iterate on campaigns based on real data\n\r\nPresent strategy recommendations to internal stakeholders and clients with clear reasoning\n\r\nManage ad budgets responsibly and report on ROI regularly\n\r\nCoordinate with sales and operations teams to ensure booked appointments are being followed up on effectively\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Is NOT\n\r\nThis position is not a graphic design role, a social media management role, or a content creation role. You will not be responsible for designing ads, posting organic social content, managing brand voice day-to-day, or building websites. HelloAi has a dedicated in-house design team that handles all creative production — your job is strategy, research, and results.\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nProven experience running paid ad campaigns with measurable outcomes (appointment setting experience is a strong plus)\n\r\nStrong analytical mindset — you make decisions based on data, not gut feelings alone\n\r\nExperience writing creative briefs and directing creative teams toward a performance goal\n\r\nFamiliarity with CRM and lead tracking tools\n\r\nExcellent communication skills, both written and verbal\n\r\nAbility to manage multiple client campaigns simultaneously without dropping the ball\n\r\nSelf-motivated and comfortable working toward performance-based goals\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\nWe offer a competitive base salary plus commission. The commission is tied directly to qualified appointments booked as a result of your campaigns, with bonus potential for hitting monthly and quarterly volume targets. This structure is designed to reward performance while giving you the stability to build campaigns the right way.\n\r\nHelloAi is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diverse teams build better strategies.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe key changes are that the \"What This Role Is NOT\" section now clearly calls out that design is handled in-house, and the responsibilities now include writing creative briefs and collaborating with the design team rather than producing creative themselves.

I need a reliable, detail-oriented video editor to handle short-form content (YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels) and straightforward long-form YouTube edits on an ongoing, long-term basis — not a one-off project.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will primarily be editing for one client to start, with additional editing work from other clients as the relationship grows. This is a role with room to expand in both scope and compensation as my business scales.\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant Note About Content: The primary client you'll be editing for produces right-leaning American political commentary. The content includes strong opinions, humor, and topics that some may find controversial or offensive. You must be comfortable working with this type of material professionally, regardless of your personal views. If political content would make you uncomfortable or affect the quality of your work, this is not the right fit — no hard feelings.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Editing\n\r\nShort-form videos (YouTube Shorts / Instagram Reels):\n\r\n\n\r\n30–90 second clips cut from longer livestreams and recorded content\n\r\nTalking head commentary with b-roll, text overlays, and music\n\r\nFull styled captions/subtitles (you will handle transcription and captioning — style specs provided)\n\r\nComedy and timing are a big part of what makes these work — you need to recognize what's funny and how to land a punchline through editing\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-form YouTube videos (8–20 minutes):\n\r\n\n\r\nEdited from streams and recorded content\n\r\nCuts, pacing, basic color correction, basic transitions, and light graphics\n\r\nNo heavy motion graphics required\n\r\n\n\r\nB-Roll Sourcing (Both Short-Form and Long-Form):\n\r\nThis is a key part of the role. You will be responsible for finding and incorporating appropriate b-roll into your edits. This includes:\n\r\n\n\r\nResearching and downloading relevant news clips from YouTube — if the video covers a recent event, you need to find footage of that event to edit into the video\n\r\nFinding images of specific people, places, or i\n referenced in the content\n\r\nUsing stock footage where appropriate — you must have access to a stock footage platform (Storyblocks, Artlist, Canva Pro, or similar)\n\r\nGeneral awareness of American politics and current events is important, OR you must have excellent research skills to quickly find relevant visuals for topics you may not be familiar with\n\r\n\n\r\nAs the role grows, you may also edit similar content for other clients — short-form clips, reels, and simple long-form edits across different niches.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n\n\r\nAdobe Premiere Pro — You must own or have reliable access to Premiere Pro. You will deliver both finished exports AND the Premiere Pro project file (.prproj) with all assets organized so I can go back in and make revisions if needed. Access to the broader Adobe Suite (After Effects, Photoshop, etc.) is a plus but not required.\n\r\n\n\r\nDescript — You must have a Descript subscription for transcription and caption/subtitle work. If you don't currently have one, you must be willing to get one. I will provide the exact caption style specifications.\n\r\nStock footage access — You must have a subscription to a stock footage/media platform (Storyblocks, Artlist, Canva Pro, or equivalent) for sourcing b-roll where news clips or specific footage aren't available.\n\r\n\n\r\nExcellent English comprehension — this is absolutely critical. The primary creator you'll be editing has a very thick Southern American accent. Even native English speakers sometimes need to replay sections to catch what he's saying. You need to be confident in your ability to accurately transcribe and caption heavily accented, fast-paced American English. If English comprehension is not one of your strongest skills, this role will be extremely difficult and frustrating for both of us. Please be honest with yourself about this.\n\r\n\n\r\nResearch skills — You need to be resourceful. If the creator references a news story, a political figure, or a past i\n, you must be able to quickly research it and find relevant images, clips, or footage to include as b-roll in the edit.\n\r\n\n\r\nFamiliarity with American pop culture, internet humor, \ns, and current events is a strong plus. The content includes references to trending topics, political figures, and internet culture. You don't need to be an expert, but awareness helps you make better editing choices and find better b-roll.\n\r\n\n\r\nReliable internet connection and ability to download/upload large video files regularly.\n\r\n\n\r\nAvailable to start within 1 week.\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have (Not Required)\n\r\n\n\r\nAI image/video generation skills — Some edits benefit from AI-generated visuals, especially for comedy segments where traditional b-roll doesn't exist. If you have experience with AI tools (Midjourney, Runway, Kling, etc.), that's a major bonus. If not, I'm willing to train you on this, as it's my specialty.\n\r\n\n\r\nSkills & Qualities I'm Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nThe #1 quality I need is someone who can watch 5–10 existing videos on a channel and match that editing style independently. I don't want to micromanage every cut.\n\r\n\n\r\nSpecifically:\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong sense of pacing and comedic timing — knowing when to hold on a reaction, when to cut, when to let a \nnt breathe, and how to land a joke\n\r\nAbility to emulate an already established editing style by studying existing content — not imposing your own creative preferences\n\r\nResourceful b-roll sourcing — you can find relevant, appropriate visuals quickly without being told exactly what to search for\n\r\nBasic color correction skills\n\r\nComfortable with basic transitions — clean and intentional, nothing flashy\n\r\nSelf-directed work ethic — you study the training materials, ask smart questions when something is unclear, and deliver work that doesn't require heavy revision\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I Provide\n\r\n\n\r\nDetailed training recordings — I have multi-hour screen recordings showing my complete editing process for both short-form and long-form content, start to finish. These cover everything: how I select clips from streams, how I pace edits, how I handle captions, how I source b-roll, and the specific style choices that matter. Additional training recordings will be added as we work together.\n\r\nStyle guides and caption specifications — You won't be guessing. The visual style, caption style, and editing approach are documented.\n\r\nClear, specific feedback — If something needs adjustment, I'll tell you exactly what and why. I don't expect perfection on day one, but I do expect quick improvement and consistent effort to match the established style. To confirm you've read this far, please include the word \"mangoes\" somewhere in your application message.\n\r\nExample content — Before you start any edit, I will provide reference videos so you can see exactly what the finished product should look and feel like.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Payment\n\r\n\n\r\n$600–$1,000/month USD depending on experience, skill level, and weekly workload. Higher pay for editors who can handle more volume independently and deliver work that requires minimal revision.\n\r\n\n\r\nPayment schedule: Weekly, paid after each week of completed work. This is standard practice — you work, I review, I pay. No upfront payment required from either side. After the first 1–2 months, we can transition to biweekly or monthly if we both prefer.\n\r\n\n\r\nPayment method: EasyPay (Payoneer), PayPal, or Wise — we can discuss what works best for you.\n\r\nThis is a long-term position with room to grow in both scope and compensation as my business takes on new clients.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply (Follow These Steps Exactly)\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Use exactly 10 Apply Points when submitting your application. Applications with any other number of points will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Send a link to your portfolio OR 2–3 samples of short-form video content you've edited (YouTube Shorts, Reels, TikToks, etc.). Bonus points if any samples include b-roll that you sourced yourself.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Confirm that you have access to Adobe Premiere Pro, Descript (or willingness to get it), and a stock footage platform\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Confirm you are comfortable editing right-leaning American political commentary content.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate your ability to understand heavily accented American English? Be honest — this will be tested during the trial.\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Briefly describe your process when you're given a new channel to edit for — how do you learn and match the style?\n\r\n\n\r\n7. Do you have any experience with AI image or video generation tools? If yes, which ones?\n\r\n\n\r\nHiring Process\n\r\n\n\r\nSelected applicants will receive a paid test task ($15–$25) before any ongoing commitment is made. You'll edit one real short-form video so we can both evaluate whether the fit is right. This test is paid regardless of outcome.                ",
