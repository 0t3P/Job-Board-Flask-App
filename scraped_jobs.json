Users tell Yibby who they’re shopping for — for example, “my dad, born in 1980, loves anime, birthday gift” — and Yibby suggests thoughtful, personalized gifts based on interests, demographics, personality, seasonality, and more.\n\r\n\n\r\nYibby’s recommendation engine is powered by a curated gift database and supported through affiliate partnerships with Amazon, Target, Etsy, TikTok Shop, and others. Our mission is to make gift-giving joyful, personal, and effortless.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re hiring a Product Manager who will also serve as Yibby’s “Gift Master” — the human curator responsible for making sure Yibby recommends amazing, high-quality gifts.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a hands-on role focused on building and maintaining the universe of gifts that Yibby can recommend. You will ensure that every item in our system is:\n\r\n\n\r\n- A genuinely great gift  \n\r\n- High-quality  \n\r\n- In-stock and up to date  \n\r\n- Seasonally appropriate  \n\r\n- Eligible for strong affiliate commissions  \n\r\n- Matched to the correct recipient profiles and occasions  \n\r\n\n\r\nYour responsibilities include:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.

Optimizing Based on Business Goals\n\r\n- Filtering out low-commission, low-quality, or unavailable items  \n\r\n- Tracking seasonal trends and upcoming holidays  \n\r\n- Identifying trending items, viral products, and new releases  \n\r\n\n\r\n3. Maintaining the Gift Database\n\r\n- Creating structured attributes and metadata for each product  \n\r\n- Improving the taxonomy of categories, tags, and matching logic  \n\r\n- Ensuring the recommendation engine has the right inputs to select great gifts  \n\r\n\n\r\n4. Reviewing Gift Content\n\r\nYou will collaborate with Yibby’s content team responsible for producing:\n\r\n- Product photos  \n\r\n- Lifestyle images  \n\r\n- Short videos  \n\r\n- AI-generated UGC or demos  \n\r\n\n\r\nYour role is to ensure the content is accurate, appealing, and suited to the gifting scenario.\n\r\n\n\r\n5.

    "description": "\n                    Hi everyone — I wanted to share something a little different here.\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm with Lime Health AI. We build AI-powered tools for the U.S. home health and hospice industry — specifically AI OASIS Scribe and AI Coding. Our software helps agencies save time on documentation, reduce coding errors, and stay compliant.\n\r\nI'm reaching out because I know many of you work directly with U.S.-based home care agencies and hospices. You have relationships with owners and administrators that we simply don't have. And that's valuable.\n\r\n\n\r\nSo here's what I'd like to propose:\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you have a relationship with a home health agency or hospice owner and can make an introduction, we'd love to work with you on a referral basis. If that introduction leads to a signed client, we'll pay you a referral bonus — starting at $2,000 USD for a standard-sized agency, and it goes up from there depending on the size of the organization.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow it actually works:\n\r\n\n\r\nThe first step is just a call with us. We'd schedule a time to talk, get to know each other, and hear about the connection you have — who the agency is, your relationship with the owner, and how you'd make the introduction. Nothing complicated. On that call, we'll confirm the exact referral bonus so there are no surprises.\n\r\n\n\r\nFrom there, you introduce us to the agency owner. We take it from there on the sales side. If we close the deal, we honor the amount we agreed on. Simple as that.\n\r\n\n\r\nA few things worth mentioning:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe do ask that everyone interested schedule an intro call with us first. It's not a screening — it's just a conversation. We want to make sure we're on the same page and that we can answer any questions you have before you put your name behind an introduction. \n\r\n\n\r\nWho is this a good fit for?\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're an ICD-10 or OASIS coder who works with U.S. home health or hospice agencies and you're on good terms with an owner or decision-maker — this could be a great fit. Even if you're just curious about how it works, we're happy to hop on a quick call and explain more.\n\r\n\n\r\nFeel free to send a message if you're interested. Looking forward to connecting.\n\r\n— Lime Health AI                ",

My name is Mel, and I own the top Christian speed-dating services in the United States! I’m on the lookout for a new assistant to grow with me. There are countless opportunities for growth, and I’m so excited to find the right person to join the team.

Here's a testimonial from one of my assistants:\n\r\n\n\r\n\"I’ve been working as Mel's VA since September 2024, and I genuinely love it. The work is meaningful (helping people find their Godly spouses), fast-paced, and never boring. You’re supporting a business that’s actively scaling. Mel is professional, clear, and respectful of boundaries. I can fully enjoy my days off, travel when needed, and never worry about work piling up. She also pays weekly and always on time. That said, a great client is great for a reason. This role requires great - truly GREAT - attention to detail. Mel has high standards, and rightfully so. If you’re not detail-oriented, proactive, and committed to doing excellent work, this won’t be the right fit. But if you are, working with her is incredibly fulfilling. I’m grateful to be part of her team and to support a leader who is clear, mission-driven, and genuinely good to work with.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease read carefully before applying\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is not creative, not social-media strategy, and not “wing-it” work.\n\r\nThis role is for someone who genuinely enjoys:\n\r\n• Following detailed SOPs\n\r\n• Working from templates\n\r\n• Tracking numbers\n\r\n• Executing conditional logic accurately\n\r\n• Catching mistakes before they happen\n\r\n• Doing important but sometimes tedious admin work extremely well\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are not naturally obsessive about details, this role will feel overwhelming.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Role:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run highly organized, multi-city events with complex ticket logic, conditional\n workflows, and time-sensitive admin tasks. One small mistake can create downstream issues, so precision matters. You will be responsible for executing systems exactly as documented, while also helping improve them over time once you fully understand how everything works.
