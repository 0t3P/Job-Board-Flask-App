    "description": "\n                    Honestly, all these other job postings here sound reallyy dry and boring :D \n\r\n\n\r\nLet me try differently.\n\r\n\n\r\nI don't care about hard skills. I just need someone outgoing and ON FIRE about personal development, who would like to use my App for his/her day-to-day personal development and share the journey online, through all ups and downs :)\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's it.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour win: Well, the salary, of course.\n\r\nYour other win: You'll improve in the areas you would like to improve in, personally - 100% guaranteed.\n\r\nYour other win: You'll learn how to build a personal, authentic brand online. That you may later use for your own business? I'm very happy to help with any experiment of your own.\n\r\nMy win: You become an authentic face of the brand :) Super valuable for growing a community.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE APP (iPhone only)\n\r\nI realized that almost everyone would like to grow as a person, but no one REALLY knows how and where to start.\n\r\nHaving lots of experience in this area, I've built the first proper SYSTEM for personal development - so that literally anyone can start easily and doesn't need to buy an expensive Coach.\n\r\n-> \"Identity - Your Growth System\" in the App Store, just check it out, it's free. Early user feedback (250 users) has been insane! \n\r\n\n\r\nThe App structures this whole journey, gives lots of guidance and makes tracking super intuitive.\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR CONCRETE DELIVERABLES\n\r\n1 Reel per Day. \n\r\nWe iterate between low-effort reels, medium-effort, and high-effort.\n\r\nLow-Effort: Static shot, with single-statement on the screen\n\r\nMedium-Effort: Talking to the camera, sharing some learning/insight/struggle/tips\n\r\nHigh-Effort: \"Day in the Life\" type Reel\n\r\n-> I built a content engine that spits out a lot of ideas/messages, for the days where you don't have something natural to share\n\r\n\n\r\nWAYS OF WORKING\n\r\nNo micro-managing at all. We discuss the goals I have for the channel, and you have full creative freedom. I'm always available to assist with sparring ideas or removing blockers. We do a (paid) weekly feedback call, to discuss what is going good and what can be improved from both sides.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT I'M HOPING FOR\n\r\nThe only thing important for me is that you are an outgoing personality, and that you are really passionate about personal growth. Not necessarily that you're already an expert, but that you would LOVE to become one.\n\r\nSome examples:\n\r\n- reaching fitness goals (gym, calisthenics, pilates, yoga, core workouts, running, ..)\n\r\n- happiness and mindfulness (meditation, breathing, journaling, reducing doomscrolling, ..)\n\r\n- getting a better rhythm (sleeping times, waking times, evening routine, morning routine, ..)\n\r\n- better social life (meeting friends for coffee, organizing a dinner, calling friends/family, ..)\n\r\n- learning/curiosity (reading, podcasts, ..)\n\r\n- creativity (writing, painting, making music, ..)\n\r\n- purpose (side hustle, volunteering, ..)\n\r\n\n\r\nIF YOU HAVE READ UNTIL HERE\n\r\nYou're most likely a good candidate, otherwise you wouldn't have remained interested ;)\n\r\nBegin your application with \"LETS HAVE SOME FUN\", then a small text (2-5 sentences) explaining why you would love to get this job, and what makes you a good fit. End with \"I have an iPhone\" (you must be an iPhone user, because the App is iPhone-only).\n\r\nFeel free to attach any supporting material if you want.\n\r\n\n\r\nKICKOFF\n\r\nTwo paid trial weeks, for both of us to see whether it's a good fit :)                ",

    "description": "\n                    Hey there smarty pants!\n\r\n\n\r\nMy name is Jason and I run one of the top eBay shoe stores in the US for men's and women's shoes for over 6 years. Think of your Nike's, Asics, Adidas, Hoka, etc. I am looking to bring on an experienced technical person to join our small, but intimate team.\n\r\n\n\r\nCurrent Challenge:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe use many different supplier websites to fulfill our orders, and this list is growing. We don't use huge ecommerce websites like Amazon, Walmart, or Walmart, our main suppliers are shoe retailers like Nike, Finishline, FootLocker, and even small mom and pop shoe stores that host their website using Shopify. However, everything is done manually by our team, meaning every day, we need to go on the supplier website, check price and inventory levels, and then manually update our listings on eBay. This process is not only time consuming, it regularly causes issues such as missing a sale/markdown, selling shoes that are already out of stock, and prevents us from reaching higher levels as add more shoes means more time added to updating our price and stock levels.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We Are Looking For:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe want to optimize and automate our price and stock checking process as much as possible. If you've built and maintained web scrapers at scale, understand the full web scraping stack (proxies, browser automation, parsing, anti-bot bypass), an expert in organizing scraped data in a spreadsheet, can make smart decisions about tools and costs, or if all this web scraping talk is a piece of cake for you based on your technical skill level, you are who we are looking for.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs I said before, we use a lot of different supplier websites, so each website will need its own solution. Some are difficult to scrape, some are easy, some requires you to add item to cart before getting price. If you completely understand what I am talking about and you are already thinking of solutions in your head, please keep reading..\n\r\n\n\r\nMust Have's:\n\r\n\n\r\n3-5+ years of professional working experience in web scraping, data engineering, full-stack/backend development, or automation engineering, basically, work where building scrapers would be an easy straightforward task, not a stretch.\n\r\n\n\r\nProficient in Python and/or JavaScript (Node.js):\n\r\n- Most scraping work is done in Python (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Playwright, requests) or JavaScript (Puppeteer, Playwright)\n\r\n- You need to be able to write real code, not just use no-code tools\n\r\n\n\r\nDeep understanding of the web scraping stack\n\r\n- Fetching (HTTP requests, headless browsers, Playwright/Puppeteer)\n\r\n- Anti-bot bypass (proxies, residential IPs, fingerprinting, CAPTCHAs)\n\r\n- Parsing (CSS selectors, XPath, or AI-based extraction)\n\r\n- Scheduling and orchestration\n\r\n- You know when to use what, and why\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong Google Sheets and Google Apps Script skills:\n\r\n- This is important. The logic layer and dashboard will live in Google Sheets.\n\r\n- You should be comfortable building complex formulas, data transformations, and automated workflows in Sheets\n\r\n- You should be able to write Apps Script to process data, run calculations, trigger actions, and connect to external APIs\n\r\n- If you've built systems where Google Sheets is the \"brain\" that processes incoming data and outputs decisions — that's exactly what I need\n\r\n- I'm not looking for someone who thinks Sheets is \"just a spreadsheet.\" I need someone who knows how to make it do real work.\n\r\n\n\r\nFamiliarity with modern tools and services:\n\r\n- You know what Apify, Bright Data, ScraperAPI, Browse AI, etc. are\n\r\n- You understand the tradeoffs between building custom vs using services\n\r\n- You can make smart decisions about cost vs complexity\n\r\n\n\r\nCost-conscious mindset:\n\r\n- I need someone who thinks about \"what's the cheapest way to reliably solve this\", not \"what's the most technically impressive\"\n\r\n- We will be making a lot of requests, so we must keep variable costs as low as possible.\n\r\n\n\r\nAPI integration experience:\n\r\n- You've connected systems together via APIs before\n\r\n- You don't need eBay-specific experience, but you should be comfortable figuring it out\n\r\n\n\r\nAbility to be self-directed and own your decisions\n\r\n- I'll explain the business requirements and any context needed. You figure out and build the technical approach/solution.\n\r\n- I'm not a developer, nor is anyone else on the team. We need someone who can make decisions, not just take orders and wait for instructions.\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus\n\r\n- Professional experience with AI/LLM automation or integration\n\r\n- Familiarity with eBay backend/API\n\r\n\n\r\nDay-to-Day:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be building web scrapers (or any other solutions) to get data we need for update-to-date price/stock levels and then maintaining these scrapers, fixing any alerts/flags that pop. You will also be building and maintaining the logic layer in Google Sheets & Google Apps Script. This layer contains the complex logic, formulas, and automations that turn the raw scraped data into useful information that will be displayed in the command layer. You will also be building and maintaining the command layer dashboard for all tea\nmbers to use. This layer will show the useful information such as final price, best supplier, stock levels, any alerts/items that need attention. You will also be building and maintaining the automation to eBay, making sure that all price and stock changes from each scrape cycle is automatically updating our eBay listings smoothly.\n\r\n\n\r\nLong story short, you will be in charge of making sure that our process from building the scrapers for each website to automating our eBay listings is running smoothly.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnce this upfront work is finished and we are in maintenance mode, we will be using your expertise to automate other processes our business. At the end of the day, our business is very simple and don't take much technical knowledge to automate.\n\r\n\n\r\nLogistics & Salary:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Full-time, fully remote,\n\r\n- Preferably Mon-Fri (PST), especially in the beginning, but can be negotiable\n\r\n- Communication through Slack\n\r\n- Ready to begin immediately\n\r\n- Salary ranging anywhere from $5-$12 USD per hour, of course, all based on experience\n\r\n\n\r\nFinal Remarks:\n\r\n\n\r\nIf any of this sounds confusing, or worse, you don't even have at least 3 year of actual working professional experience (one-time projects do not count), please do not apply as we will be wasting our times. After all, for the person who is truly experienced, web scraping is a quite the low level skill, even for complex websites with anti bot technology. So, if you are a person who has worked in environments where much higher technical skills were required from you than simple web scraping and data organization, you are someone we would love to add to our team!\n\r\n\n\r\nHow To Apply:\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease don't send me a generic cover letter or your life story. I just want to see that you've done this kind of work, or work that would make this look like a walk in the park. I also want you to see your ability to think though the problem. Send me:\n\r\n\n\r\n- A brief intro: who you are, where you're based, and why you think you are perfect for this role\n\r\n- Relevant experience(s): any professional working experience, no one off projects or experiences that has nothing to do with what I am looking for\n\r\n- Your approach: briefly tell me in your own words/understanding what the issue is with my currently process and how you would approach solving this issue\n\r\n- Your rate: whatever you prefer, just give me a ballpark if you are unsure\n\r\n\n\r\nMessage me with the subject line \"GSTEAM AUTOMATOR\". Subject lines without this will be ignored. Also, DO NOT SEND\nS, I will not respond.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf something in this post is unclear, please feel free to ask, I would be glad to clarify.\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you!

Thanks! ***\n\r\n\n\r\nCompany Description\n\r\nEngage Video Production (EVP) creates educational and communication focused video content, primarily for aerospace, defense, and technical clients. Our work helps high stakes organizations explain complex ideas clearly, train teams effectively, and communicate with absolute precision. We operate with a military grade standard of excellence and are looking for a Motion Graphics Artist & Graphic Designer who is ready to grow within a high accountability environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Three Pillars of Success at EVP\n\r\nTo succeed here, you must embody these three core values:\n\r\n\n\r\nDiscipline: You follow through on every task without \"floundering\" or ghosting. You possess the self-discipline to manage your time and meet deadlines without constant supervision.\n\r\n\n\r\nMotivation and Dedication: You are dedicated to the mission and the company's growth. You don't just \"do a job\"; you look for ways to contribute to the overall success of the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nRadical Integrity and Accountability: You own your mistakes immediately. You have the backbone to point out errors for correction, even if they are your own, because you understand that precision is non-negotiable.\n\r\n\n\r\n*** Role Overview *** \n\r\nThis is a dual-focus role. You will be the primary creator for our dedicated explainer and motion graphics videos, but you will also assist in the creation of graphic assets (when needed) for our standard video team. You will coordinate with our video editors to provide the graphic elements, overlays, and design assets that elevate every project we produce.\n\r\n*** Core Responsibilities *** \n\r\nMotion Graphics Mastery: Lead the production of full-scale explainer videos, from storyboarding and asset creation to final animation.\n\r\nCollaborative Design: Act as the internal design resource for our standard video editors. You will create the lower thirds, callouts, and technical diagrams they need for their edits.\n\r\nWeb & Digital Assets: Design high-fidelity web page elements and marketing collateral that align with our brand and our clients' technical standards.\n\r\nBrand Consistency: Ensure a \"Rising Tide\" level of quality across all visual touchpoints, maintaining a clean, professional, and sophisticated aesthetic.\n\r\n\n\r\n*** Must-Have Technical Skills*** \n\r\nTechnical Stack: Proficiency in Adobe After Effects, Illustrator, and Photoshop - or similar graphical editing software.\n\r\n\n\r\nPortfolio: A strong reel showcasing explainer videos and a portfolio of clean, functional graphic design (web elements, technical icons, etc.).\n\r\n\n\r\nLeadership/Coordination: Ability to work alongside other editors, providing them with the assets they need to succeed on their timelines.\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunication: Exceptional English skills and a proactive communication style.\n\r\n\n\r\n*** Compensation ***\n\r\nStarting at: $350 (~20,000 PHP) to $600 (~34,500 PHP) USD per month, based on 20 hours/week, subject to change. \n\r\nStarting Rate: $4.00 to $7.00 USD per hour.  [*Conversions are approximate.]\n\r\n\n\r\nPart-Time (20 hrs/week): $345 – $605 USD (~?19,500 – ?34,250 PHP) monthly.\n\r\nFull-Time (40 hrs/week): $640 – $1,120 USD (~?36,800 – ?64,500 PHP) monthly.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nRate Determination: Starting salary/rates are dependent upon experience and demonstrated skill.\n\r\n\n\r\nA Note on AI and Judgment\n\r\nAt EVP, we use advanced tools every day. However, this role requires high level human judgment and Radical Integrity. We are hiring a human, not a prompt. If you use AI to draft your personal responses in the “How to Apply” section, you are failing the first test of this role: Honesty. We want to hear your real thoughts and see your real personality to ensure you will be a good fit on our team. If your application lacks a unique human voice, it will be discarded. Use AI to assist your workflow later; do not use it to represent your character now.\n\r\n\n\r\n*** How to Apply ***\n\r\nTo be considered, you must follow these steps exactly. Precision is a requirement for this role.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Subject Line - change it to: \"Technical Visual Artist – [Your Name]\".\n\r\n\n\r\n-Provide a link to your best motion and static design work. (No portfolio = no consideration).\n\r\n\n\r\n-State the 10th word of our \"Three Pillars\" section.\n\r\n\n\r\n-In exactly two sentences, describe a specific time you had to fix a mistake you made in a motion graphics project. Use plain English; no AI-generated fluff.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Attach or link to your CV/resume.  Must be in PDF format only.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Want to really stand out? Record a 60-second video (Loom or similar) introducing yourself. Tell me why you are the right pick and what about Aerospace & Defense interests you. Start the video by addressing me by name (Ryan). Applicants who include this video move to the top of the list.\n\r\n\n\r\nThanks for your time and genuine interest!                ",

Thanks! ***\n\r\n\n\r\nCompany Description\n\r\nEngage Video Production (EVP) creates educational and communication focused video content, primarily for aerospace, defense, and technical clients. Our work helps high stakes organizations explain complex ideas clearly, train teams effectively, and communicate with absolute precision. We operate with a military grade standard of excellence and are looking for a Junior VA (Junior Business Operations Assistant) who is ready to grow within a high accountability environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Three Pillars of Success at EVP\n\r\nTo succeed here, you must embody these three core values:\n\r\n\n\r\nDiscipline: You follow through on every task without \"floundering\" or ghosting. You possess the self-discipline to manage your time and meet deadlines without constant supervision.\n\r\n\n\r\nMotivation and Dedication: You are dedicated to the mission and the company's growth. You don't just \"do a job\"; you look for ways to contribute to the overall success of the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nRadical Integrity and Accountability: You own your mistakes immediately. You have the backbone to point out errors for correction, even if they are your own, because you understand that precision is non-negotiable.\n\r\n\n\r\n*** Role Overview *** \n\r\nThis is a \"Junior Plus\" role designed for someone who is not completely green but is looking to move toward a high level lead position. We invest in people who show discipline, but we have zero tolerance for lack of communication.\n\r\n\n\r\n*** Core Responsibilities *** \n\r\nData Management: Update and maintain Google Sheets with project tracking data.\n\r\n\n\r\nSocial Media Support: Basic scheduling and engagement via Meta Business Suite and LinkedIn.\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunication: Drafting clear, concise internal updates and client\ns.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdministrative Support: Scheduling meetings, business organization tasks, coordinating with other members of the team/business.  May also include helping the team by organizing digital files and ensuring project folders meet our strict naming conventions.\n\r\n\n\r\n*** Must-Have Technical Skills*** \n\r\nGoogle Workspace: High proficiency in Google Sheets (data entry and basic formulas) and\n communications.\n\r\n\n\r\nMeta Business Suite: Experience scheduling posts and monitoring basic analytics (LinkedIn,\n, Instagram).\n\r\n\n\r\nEnglish Fluency: Excellent written and verbal communication skills.\n\r\n\n\r\n*** Compensation ***\n\r\nStarting at: $250 (~14,500 PHP) to $350 (~20,000 PHP) USD per month, based on 20 hours/week, subject to change and operational demand. [*Conversions are approximate.]\n\r\n\n\r\nRate Determination: Starting salary within the ranges above is dependent upon experience and skill.\n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule: Flexible, but requires a 2 hour overlap with US Central Time (CST) for sync meetings.  There are also responsiveness requirements for urgent issues/communications. \n\r\n\n\r\nA Note on AI and Judgment\n\r\nAt EVP, we use advanced tools every day. However, this role requires high level human judgment and Radical Integrity. We are hiring a human, not a prompt. If you use AI to draft your personal responses in the “How to Apply” section, you are failing the first test of this role: Honesty We want to hear your real thoughts and see your real personality to ensure you will be a good fit on our team. If your application lacks a unique human voice, it will be discarded. Use AI to assist your workflow later; do not use it to represent your character now.\n\r\n\n\r\n*** How to Apply ***\n\r\nTo be considered, you must follow these steps exactly. Precision is a requirement for this role.\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject Line - change it to: \"Precision Assistant – [Your Name]\".\n\r\n\n\r\n-State the 10th word of our \"Three Pillars\" section.\n\r\n\n\r\n-List three bullet points on why you are the right fit. Constraint: Do not use the words passionate, synergy, leverage, innovative, or dynamic.\n\r\n\n\r\n-In two sentences, describe a specific time you had to fix a mistake you made. Use plain English. Do not use corporate jargon or AI generated \"fluff.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n-Attach or link to your CV/resume.  Must be in PDF format only.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Want to really stand out? Record a 60-second video (Loom or similar) introducing yourself. Tell me why you are the right pick and what about Aerospace & Defense interests you. Start the video by addressing me by name (Ryan). Applicants who include this video move to the top of the list.\n\r\n\n\r\nThanks for your time and genuine interest!                ",

Custom Quote: Based on their website selections.\n\r\n• The Legal Lock: Implement a strict \"Contract First\" logic—the system must require a signature before the payment portal is unlocked.\n\r\n• Automated Nurturing: Smart\n sequences for follow-ups, event prep, and post-event reviews.\n\r\n• Pipeline Clarity: A visual stage-gate system: Inquiry ? Quote Sent ? Contract Pending ? Retainer Paid ? Fully Booked.\n\r\n3. Data & Financial Command Center (Excel/Sheets)\n\r\nBuild a master dashboard that pulls data (via Zapier/Make) to track:\n\r\n• Revenue Metrics: Monthly totals, deposit statuses, and outstanding balances.\n\r\n• Inventory Performance: Which packages/add-ons are the most profitable?\n\r\n• Sales Data: Lead sources and conversion rates.\n\r\n4.

yachts, coaching businesses and more.\n\r\n\n\r\nAlthough we are based in Australia, this is a full-time remote position being recruited in South Africa and the Philippines.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for a Senior SEO Specialist (5+ years’ experience) with a proven track record of delivering measurable organic growth that translates into real revenue.\n\r\nThis is not a role for someone who focuses on rankings alone.\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who understands that:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\tRankings without traffic are meaningless\n\r\n•\tTraffic without conversions is vanity\n\r\n•\tSEO must generate measurable ROI\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be accountable not just for ranking commercial keywords — but for driving qualified visitors and proving that the traffic generated produces leads and/or e-commerce sales.\n\r\nIf Google Ads dominates certain search results, you must know how to identify opportunities where organic traffic can still win and produce measurable commercial impact.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\r\n\n\r\nSuccess in this role means:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\tIdentifying revenue-driving keyword opportunities\n\r\n•\tIncreasing qualified organic

achieved.\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who takes ownership and proves performance.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience & Skills Required\n\r\n\n\r\n•\t5+ years of professional SEO experience\n\r\n•\tProven track record of increasing rankings and qualified organic traffic\n\r\n•\tClear evidence of SEO campaigns that generated measurable leads or revenue\n\r\n•\tStrong experience in on-page SEO and content creation\n\r\n•\tDeep understanding of technical SEO\n\r\n•\tExperience with Local SEO (Google Business Profile optimisation)\n\r\n•\tStrong commercial mindset — understands revenue impact\n\r\n•\tExperience using leading SEO tools (Ahrefs, SEMrush, Screaming Frog, etc.)\n\r\n•\tAbility to independently execute both strategy and implementation\n\r\nYou must be able to demonstrate past campaigns where SEO generated real ROI.\n\r\n\n\r\nAccountability\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be directly responsible for:\n\r\n•\tIncreasing qualified organic traffic\n\r\n•\tImproving rankings for

Our flagship offers are mentor-led, cohort-based programs focused on shipping production-grade projects and landing Rust-heavy roles.\n\r\n\n\r\n is one of our main revenue channels. We use it to fill cohorts, book sales calls, and reactivate our warm audience. We’re hiring someone to own this function end-to-end.\n\r\n\n\r\nRole Overview\n\r\nYou will own the strategy, copy, and execution of\n campaigns that drive launches, bookings, reactivations, and long-term revenue from our list. This is a senior, full-time role for someone who wants clear ownership, measurable impact, and a long-term seat on the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are not “writing some\ns.” You are building a repeatable\n machine that keeps our calendar full and our cohorts sold out.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Own\n\r\n1. Launch Campaigns (Cohorts & Fast-Cash Promos)\n\r\nPlan and write complete launch sequences for our cohorts and promo offers (pre-launch, open cart, objections, FAQ, deadline, last call, sold-out, etc.).\n\r\nStandardize, document, and templatize launches so they’re easy to clone and improve.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Evergreen Nurture & Segmentation\n\r\nBuild and maintain evergreen sequences that warm new subscribers and move them toward a call or application.\n\r\nSegment based on behavior and stage (new leads, engaged, inactive, past applicants, buyers) so people get the right messages at the right time.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Show-Up & No-Show Sequences\n\r\nWrite and optimize sequences that increase show-up rates for booked calls.\n\r\nCreate follow-up for no-shows and no-buys to recover missed revenue and keep good leads in motion.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Reactivation Campaigns\n\r\nRun quarterly reactivation campaigns for cold or inactive subscribers to generate “found” revenue from the list.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like in the First 90 Days\n\r\n- 3 complete launch sequences live, documented, and reusable.\n\r\n- 1 evergreen nurture sequence live, for new leads.\n\r\n- Show-up rate on\n-sourced calls improved vs. baseline.\n\r\n- At least 1 reactivation campaign shipped with clear revenue attribution.\n\r\n- Clear\n playbook (templates, frameworks, naming) the team can understand and reuse.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n- 3+ years professional B2C\n copy experience.\n\r\n- Proven track record owning full launch/email sequences (not just individual\ns).\n\r\n- Strong understanding of offer positioning, sequencing, and deadlines for high-ticket educational or coaching products.\n\r\n- Ability to write in a clear, human voice that resonates with senior, technical audiences.\n\r\n- Comfortable with at least 3-hour overlap with US pacific time zone, async with a distributed team, and being accountable to numbers (revenue, bookings, show rates).\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus\n\r\n- Experience with technical or software developer audiences.\n\r\n- Familiarity with platforms like Kartra, ActiveCampaign, or similar.\n\r\n- Comfortable pulling basic numbers from dashboards/CRMs to see what’s working.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nIn your application, include:\n\r\n- A brief personal intro (2–5 short sentences) in your own words.\n\r\n- 1–2 examples of launch or promo sequences you’ve written (cohort, course, or high-ticket offers).\n\r\n- A short note explaining how you approach writing launch\ns for a high-ticket cohort program.\n\r\n- Your monthly salary expectation in USD (full-time) and your official\n address.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication Question (Required):\n\r\n1. Which part of the\n lifecycle do you enjoy owning most? (launches, nurture, reactivation, post-purchase, etc.) What\n platforms have you worked in?\n\r\n2. Briefly describe one launch\n sequence you’ve owned end-to-end.\n\r\n3. In 5–7 bullet points, outline:\n\r\n- the audience\n\r\n- the goal of the sequence\n\r\n- how you structured the sequence (early ? middle ? final\ns)\n\r\n- one decision you made to avoid audience fatigue\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that skip any of the above will not be considered.
