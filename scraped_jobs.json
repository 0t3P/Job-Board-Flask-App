    "description": "\n                    Hello! I've just made a profile based off my friends recommendation to use this website. \n\r\n\n\r\nI have looked, looked and looked some more for a video editor for my project but have found it very hard. I have so much footage and it is a long video, many video editors didn't understand what I wanted. \n\r\n\n\r\nHere is the brief (it is obvious that I used chatgpt for this brief because every other brief I wrote myself, nobody seemed to understand the vibe or atmosphere of a video I wanted to create):\n\r\n\n\r\nObjective:\n\r\nCreate a polished travel vlog from my footage in Seoul that feels cinematic, immersive, and story-driven, similar in vibe to the reference video I shared (YouTube link at the bottom). I want the viewer to feel like they’re experiencing Seoul with me, rather than just watching random clips.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Overall Style & Tone\n\r\n• Vibe: Authentic, warm, cinematic travel storytelling — a mix of visual montage and voiceover narration that feels reflective and personal.\n\r\n• Editing Style: Smooth pacing — not too fast like a flashy/viral style, but engaging enough to keep interest (think visual rhythm matched to music, subtle mood changes throughout the video).\n\r\n• Color Grading: Natural with slight warmth — enhance city lights, food scenes, nightlife, and candid \nnts without overly heavy filters.\n\r\n• Transitions: Clean cuts, some soft dissolves or film-like transitions where appropriate for mood shifts.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Narrative Structure\n\r\n1. Intro (0:00–0:15)\n\r\n• Establishing shots of Seoul — city skyline, streets, markets, your arrival, etc.\n\r\n• Overlay a short intro voiceover (e.g., “I lived in Seoul for three years and love the people here etc;/I’m here for my friend’s wedding…”) — set the tone for the story.\n\r\n2. Story Progression\n\r\nI want the video to feel like a journey with emotional beats:\n\r\nSection Visuals Voiceover\n\r\nSeeing friends Footage of meetups, greetings, city walks Reflective, personal memories\n\r\nEating & food scenes Shots of plates, eating, street food Voiceover about favourite meals\n\r\nPartying / nightlife Club clips, street scenes Personal commentary about experiences\n\r\nDaily life & exploration Temples, markets, streets, trains Relating thoughts and mood\n\r\n• Only use my speaking footage as voiceover commentary, never as full on-camera talking segments.\n\r\n• Align visuals to the rhythm and emotion of the voiceover — emotional, real, conversational.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Audio & Music\n\r\n• Music: Ambient, chill beats that enhance atmosphere but don’t overpower voiceover.\n\r\n• Voiceover: Clear, balanced — place emphasis transitions between scenes.\n\r\n• Sound Design: Include ambient sounds when useful (street noise, laughter, music in the background) but keep clarity of the voiceover.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Pacing & Feel\n\r\n• Have visual pacing match the emotion of each section — slower and immersive during reflective parts, slightly more kinetic during fun outings.\n\r\n• Avoid hyper–fast jump cuts. Let \nnts breathe.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Reference Inspiration\n\r\nHere’s the link to a video with the vibe I love:\n\r\n???? YouTube Reference: \n\r\n(The storytelling cadence, emotional pacing, and seamless integration of voiceover with visuals is the style I want to emulate.)\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're interested I can tell you more over a Zoom chat.

You build trust, clarity, and momentum — and you know how to turn that into leads, bookings, and measurable growth.\n\n\n\nWe are building two fast-moving, purpose-led businesses. One focuses on empowering Indigenous entrepreneurs and community organisations. The other drives sustainable property development. Our work is values-driven, culturally aware, and trust-first.\n\n\n\nWe need a Social Media Manager & Growth Marketer who can help us show up with integrity and consistency — and convert interest into action (without sounding salesy or “marketing-ish”).\n\n\n\nThis is not a role for a task executor.\n\nThis is for someone who can collaborate with the Founder, protect the tone, and build a growth engine that compounds.\n\n\n\nWhy This Role Matters\n\n • Build trust with an audience that is cautious for good reason\n\n • Translate the Founder’s vision into content that feels human, grounded, and culturally safe\n\n • Create consistent momentum across channels (not random posting)\n\n • Generate leads that flow into our funnel: form ?\n ? booking ? delivery\n\n • Use data to improve what we do — without losing heart in the messaging\n\n\n\nWhat You’ll Own\n\n\n\nPillar 1: Trust-First Content That Sounds Like Us\n\n • Write captions that are warm, direct, and emotionally intelligent\n\n • Avoid hype, gimmicks, or “internet marketer” tone\n\n • Speak to community with respect and clarity — we “walk alongside,” we don’t “sell at”\n\n • Repurpose insights, frameworks, and resources into posts that are easy to understand\n\n\n\nPillar 2: Lead Generation & Conversion\n\n • Drive traffic to booking links and lead magnets\n\n • Create simple campaign flows that convert (post ? DM/form ? nurture ? booked call)\n\n • Improve CTAs, hooks, and formats based on results\n\n • Collaborate with the systems lead to ensure content matches the funnel and\n sequences\n\n\n\nPillar 3: Publishing Rhythm & Community Engagement\n\n • Maintain a consistent posting cadence for the WhichWay FB page (and member community where relevant)\n\n • Plan weekly content aligned to priority themes, events, and offers\n\n • Encourage meaningful engagement: questions, prompts, feedback loops\n\n • Manage basic comment/DM responses using approved scripts and escalation rules\n\n\n\nPillar 4: Reporting & Optimisation (No Vanity Metrics)\n\n • Track what matters: reach, clicks, leads, bookings, and conversion rates\n\n • Share weekly insights: what worked, what didn’t, what we’ll change next\n\n • Test and iterate thoughtfully (not chaos)\n\n • Build a simple content library system so we’re not reinventing the wheel\n\n\n\nYou’ll Succeed If You\n\n • Are values-aligned and emotionally intelligent\n\n • Can write like a real human (not a brand robot)\n\n • Understand that trust is the conversion strategy\n\n • Can translate vision into content that’s consistent and clear\n\n • Think in systems: cadence, workflow, templates, repeatability\n\n • Can handle feedback well and protect the Founder’s voice\n\n • Enjoy both creativity and accountability\n\n\n\nSuccess Looks Like\n\n • Consistent weekly content output aligned to our voice and priorities\n\n • Leads generated weekly (not just engagement)\n\n • Measurable improvement in click-through and booking conversion over time\n\n • A working content system we can hand off and scale\n\n • The Founder feels confident that the tone and integrity are protected\n\n • Community feels seen, respected, and supported\n\n\n\nMust-Have Experience\n\n • Proven experience running social media with lead generation outcomes\n\n • Strong copywriting and audience-aware storytelling\n\n • Comfort with basic performance metrics and conversion thinking\n\n • Experience scheduling and managing posts (Meta Business Suite preferred)\n\n • Ability to collaborate, take initiative, and work without micromanagement\n\n\n\nStrongly Preferred\n\n • Experience working with Indigenous communities or culturally sensitive audiences (or strong willingness to learn and follow guidance)\n\n • Experience integrating social content with funnels (forms,\n nurture, booking links)\n\n • Confidence turning long ideas into short, clear, human content\n\n\n\nPay & Perks\n\n\n\n • High-autonomy, high-trust role\n\n • Direct collaboration with the Founder and systems team\n\n • Purpose-led work with real-world outcomes\n\n • Room to grow as the businesses scale\n\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\nSend us:\n\n • Your CV or LinkedIn profile\n\n • A short Loom video (2–3 minutes) answering:\n\n 1. Why this work matters to you\n\n 2. A campaign you ran that generated leads (what were the results?)\n\n 3. How you protect brand voice and tone\n\n • 1–2 examples of posts or campaigns you’re proud of (with performance results if possible)\n\n\n\nWe are not hiring a person to “just post.”\n\nWe are looking for a thoughtful growth partner — someone who can build momentum, protect integrity, and generate leads in a way that feels aligned and human.

The concept is \"Remote-Piloted Labor\"—using pilots in the Philippines to operate robots that stock shelves in US stores.\n\r\n\n\r\nI have not built the hardware yet. This is a test to see if US store managers are interested in this service before I move into production. I need a scrappy, smart caller to help me find out if this is a business worth building.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\n\n\r\nYour job isn't to \"sell\" a product; it’s to gauge interest and book test runs. You will be my boots on the ground (via the phone) to find out which managers are desperate for help and willing to try a futuristic solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nLead Hunting: Use Indeed and Google to find stores/warehouses in Seattle, SF, and LA that are \"Urgently Hiring\" for night-shift stockers.\n\r\n\n\r\nCold Calling: Call these managers and present the concept.\n\r\n\n\r\nData Collection: I need you to take detailed notes. If they say \"No,\" I want to know exactly why. Is it safety? Price? Or do they just not believe it?\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Win: Getting a manager to agree to a 15-minute follow-up call with me to discuss a future test run.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be able to hold a real conversation. If you sound like you are reading a script, this won't work.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou need to be able to \"read\" the manager’s tone and pivot the conversation.\n\r\n\n\r\nProfessional headset, quiet workspace, and stable fiber internet.\n\r\n\n\r\nSince this is a solo experiment, I need someone who doesn't need constant hand-holding.\n\r\n\n\r\n?? HOW TO APPLY (2-Minute max Voice Memo) ??\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a cover letter. I only care about how you sound on the phone. Send a 180-second voice memo with the following:\n\r\n\n\r\n1 - Briefly summarize your US cold-calling experience.\n\r\n\n\r\n2- How will you find the direct phone numbers of store managers in Seattle for free?\n\r\n\n\r\n3 - What tools will you use? What VoIP?\n\r\n\n\r\n4 - Pitch me the \"Remote-Piloted Stocker\" concept in 2 sentences.\n\r\n\n\r\n5 - Tell me one reason you think this experiment might be difficult and how you’ll handle it.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications without this voice memo will be ignored.

    "description": "\n                    Here's a thorough post you can use on both platforms:\n\r\nSupplier Relations Specialist Needed — POD Apparel Brand (One-Time Project)\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us\n\r\nWe're a growing e-commerce brand selling custom apparel to a highly engaged niche market. We operate a Print-on-Demand model and work with an overseas supplier to fulfill orders across 50-100+ active SKUs. Our customers are loyal and have high expectations — which means our supplier relationship needs to match that standard.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Problem We Need Solved\n\r\nWe've hit a wall with our current supplier relationship and need an experienced specialist to come in, take ownership of the situation, and get it resolved. Here's what we're dealing with:\n\r\n\n\r\nWrong fabrics being used — Products are being produced with lower quality fabrics than what our brand requires. We have mockups and product specifications, but they haven't been properly communicated or enforced, and the supplier has been making material decisions without our approval.\n\r\n\n\r\nNo clear point of contact — Communication is scattered across multiple WhatsApp threads with no clear accountability. It's difficult to know who is responsible for what and nothing gets resolved in a timely manner.\n\r\n\n\r\nSlow or no responses — Response times are unacceptably slow, and follow-ups often go unanswered. This creates a lag that directly impacts our customers and our ability to fix problems quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\nUnresolved open issues — There are multiple outstanding problems that have been lingering without resolution. We need someone to audit everything, identify what's open, and drive each issue to a close.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Responsible For\n\r\nCommunication Audit — Review all existing supplier communication threads (primarily WhatsApp), organize the information, and create a clear log of every unresolved issue with status and priority.\n\r\n\n\r\nSupplier Restructure — Establish a single point of contact on the supplier's side. Define clear roles and accountability so we always know who handles quality, who handles fulfillment, and who handles escalations.\n\r\n\n\r\nProduct Standards Documentation — Work with us to document our product quality standards for each SKU category — fabric weight, material type, construction requirements — and get written acknowledgment from the supplier that they understand and will comply.\n\r\n\n\r\nIssue Resolution — Actively drive all open issues to resolution. This means following up consistently, escalating when necessary, and not letting things fall through the cracks.\n\r\n\n\r\nSOP Creation — Before the project closes, deliver a simple, clear Standard Operating Procedure for how supplier communication and quality control should be handled going forward so this situation doesn't repeat itself.\n\r\n\n\r\nSupplier Evaluation — If the current supplier is unable or unwilling to meet our standards after this engagement, we need your honest assessment and ideally a shortlist of alternative POD suppliers who can.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We're Looking For\n\r\nProven experience managing supplier relationships, preferably with Print-on-Demand or apparel manufacturers\n\r\nStrong understanding of fabric quality, blank apparel standards, and print-on-demand fulfillment processes\n\r\nAvailable during Asian business hours (China/Philippines timezone)\n\r\nMandarin fluency is a strong plus — not required if your English communication with the supplier is strong\n\r\nHighly organized with the ability to take a messy situation and bring structure to it\n\r\nDirect communicator who follows through — we need someone who pushes for answers, not someone who waits for them\n\r\nExperience creating SOPs or process documentation is a plus\n\r\n\n\r\nProject Scope & Timeline\n\r\nThis is a one-time fixed project estimated at 3-4 weeks. There is potential for an ongoing retainer role if the engagement goes well and the need continues.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply\n\r\nPlease answer the following in your proposal:\n\r\nHave you managed supplier relationships with overseas POD or apparel manufacturers before? Describe the situation and what you resolved.\n\r\nAre you available during Asian business hours?\n\r\nDo you speak Mandarin? If so, what is your proficiency level?\n\r\nWhat would your first 5 days on this project look like?\n\r\nWhat is your proposed fixed fee for this scope of work?\n\r\nWe are looking to move quickly. Detailed, specific proposals will be prioritized over generic ones.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Job Description:\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\nWe're a blockchain/DeFi company running production infrastructure that's bleeding money unnecessarily. Our AWS bill is sitting at $4,500/month – and we know it shouldn't be anywhere near that. We need someone who can come in, audit the whole setup, and actually fix it. Not just give us a report that sits in a folder.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe've already been through a few candidates who talked a big game but couldn't execute. We're done with that. If you're the type who needs handholding or can't work independently, this isn't for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Actually Do\n\r\n- Audit our entire AWS infrastructure and identify exactly where we're wasting money (we expect significant savings)\n\r\n- Optimize our Kubernetes clusters – right-size nodes, fix resource requests/limits, implement autoscaling that actually works\n\r\n- Implement cost controls: Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, spot instances where appropriate, and cleanup of orphaned resources\n\r\n- Set up monitoring and alerts so costs don't creep back up without us knowing\n\r\n- Document everything you do so the team can maintain it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHard Requirements (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n- 3+ years hands-on Kubernetes experience in production environments – EKS specifically preferred\n\r\n- Deep AWS knowledge: EC2, EKS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor\n\r\n- Proven track record of actually reducing AWS costs (be ready to share numbers/percentages)\n\r\n- Strong scripting skills (Python, Bash) for automation\n\r\n- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform or CloudFormation (Terraform preferred)\n\r\n- Self-starter who can take ownership and execute without constant oversight\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n!!!!CRITICAL: This Role Requires Surgical Precision\n\r\nThis is production infrastructure running live systems. Think of this like surgery – one wrong move can take everything down.\n\r\n- NO cowboy moves. You don't delete, modify, or remove anything without a clear plan first.\n\r\n- Every change must be planned out, documented, and confirmed with the CEO before execution.\n\r\n- Extreme attention to detail. You double-check and triple-check before touching anything.\n\r\n- If you're not 100% sure what something does, you ask first. You don't assume.\n\r\n- Methodical execution only. We value careful and correct over fast and reckless.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong Plus\n\r\n- Experience with blockchain/Web3 infrastructure\n\r\n- Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, or KEDA experience\n\r\n-  AWS certifications (Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer)\n\r\n- Experience with FinOps tools (Kubecost, CloudHealth, \n)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Need In Your Application\n\r\nDon't send a generic application. We will ignore it. Include:\n\r\n- Specific examples of AWS cost optimization you've done – what was the setup, what did you change, what % did you save?\n\r\n- Your Kubernetes experience – cluster sizes you've managed, scaling strategies you've implemented\n\r\n- Your availability and timezone (we need someone who can overlap with US business hours for some calls)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Structure\n\r\n- $20-25/hour based on experience and proven results\n\r\n- 20 hours/week to start – potential for more hours for the right person\n\r\n- Fully remote\n\r\n- Initial project: Comprehensive audit + implementation plan with clear cost reduction targets\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're someone who can actually deliver results and not just talk about them – we want to hear from you. Show us what you've done.                ",

We take pride in our systematic, data-driven approach to sourcing and our commitment to building a world-class remote team. We are not looking for someone to coast — we are looking for someone ready to grow with us.\n\r\n\n\r\nROLE OVERVIEW\n\r\nWe are seeking a motivated, detail-oriented Virtual Assistant to join our Online Arbitrage (OA) sourcing team. Your primary responsibility will be to identify profitable product opportunities for resale on Amazon using industry-standard tools and strict criteria provided by our team. This is a high-accountability role that rewards consistency, accuracy, and a willingness to learn.\n\r\n\n\r\nKEY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\n• Source profitable OA leads using Keepa, Seller AMP, and other approved tools\n\r\n• Analyze sales rank history, price trends, buy box behavior, and competition data\n\r\n• Evaluate ROI, estimated monthly sales, and competition levels against our sourcing criteria\n\r\n• Submit leads through our internal tracking system with complete data documentation\n\r\n• Maintain a consistent daily lead quota as outlined during training\n\r\n• Communicate clearly and promptly with team leads regarding sourcing findings\n\r\n• Complete our mandatory 2-week training course before independent sourcing begins\n\r\n• Stay up-to-date on Amazon policy changes that may affect sourcing decisions\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED TOOLS & KNOWLEDGE\n\r\nYou Must Have Experience With (or Be Willing to Learn):\n\r\n• Keepa – understanding sales rank history, price history, buy box trends, and offer count tracking\n\r\n• Seller AMP (SAS) – using the Chrome extension for quick ASIN analysis, ROI calculation, and eligibility checks\n\r\n• Basic understanding of Amazon FBA, Buy Box mechanics, and how IP complaints or hazmat flags can disqualify leads\n\r\n• Google Sheets or Excel – for data entry and lead documentation\n\r\n• Reliable internet connection and a computer capable of running browser extensions smoothly\n\r\nNice to Have (Bonus Skills):\n\r\n• Familiarity with Tactical Arbitrage, BrickSeek, or similar sourcing platforms\n\r\n• Understanding of ungating and restricted category navigation\n\r\n• Experience working within a VA team structure or with SOPs\n\r\n\n\r\nMANDATORY 2-WEEK TRAINING PROGRAM\n\r\nALL new hires are required to complete our structured onboarding and training program before sourcing independently.

Submitting leads sourced from shared lead lists, paid lead groups,\n lead groups, or any third-party shared lead service is STRICTLY PROHIBITED and is grounds for IMMEDIATE termination without appeal.\n\r\n\n\r\nEvery lead submitted must be independently sourced by you using approved methods.

We take lead integrity extremely seriously — it is the foundation of our competitive edge.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\r\n• Competitive pay (rate discussed during interview, based on experience and output)\n\r\n• Flexible, remote work schedule — work from anywhere\n\r\n• A structured, supportive onboarding experience with real feedback\n\r\n• A clear path for growth within our expanding operation\n\r\n• Performance-based bonuses for consistent, high-quality lead submission\n\r\n• A stable, long-term position with a serious, professional team\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR\n\r\nWe are not necessarily looking for the most experienced VA. We are looking for the RIGHT person. That means someone who is:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Trainable and coachable — willing to follow systems without cutting corners\n\r\n• Detail-oriented — small mistakes in OA sourcing cost real money\n\r\n• Self-motivated — able to hit daily targets without being micromanaged\n\r\n• Honest and transparent — we have a zero-tolerance policy for dishonesty\n\r\n• Reliable — showing up consistently, meeting deadlines, and communicating proactively\n\r\n• Growth-minded — we want people who want to be part of something bigger\n\r\n\n\r\nAUTOMATIC DISQUALIFIERS\n\r\n? Do NOT apply if you source from or intend to use shared lead lists or lead groups.\n\r\n? Do NOT apply if you are not willing to complete the 2-week training program.\n\r\n? Do NOT apply if you cannot commit to consistent daily output.\n\r\n? Do NOT apply if you are not open to following strict sourcing criteria and SOPs.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nTo be considered, please submit the following:\n\r\n\n\r\n• A brief introduction about yourself and your background\n\r\n• Your experience level with Keepa and Seller AMP (beginner / intermediate / advanced)\n\r\n• Your availability (hours per day / days per week)\n\r\n• Your desired pay rate or range\n\r\n• One example of a sourcing decision you've made (even hypothetical is fine for beginners)\n\r\n• 3 sample leads sourced within the last 7 days — include the ASIN, source store/URL, buy cost, Amazon selling price, estimated ROI, and a Keepa screenshot or link for each\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that do not include all of the above will not be reviewed.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe look forward to finding our next great tea\nmber.

    "description": "\n                    About Us:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a fast-growing e-commerce company operating multiple online stores across different niches — currently fashion and home decor/lighting, with more on the way. We are scaling quickly and expanding our team to match.\n\r\nThis is not a typical CS job. We are looking for someone who starts as a Customer Service Representative but is being hired with the explicit intention of growing into a Customer Service Manager — someone who will eventually own the entire CS function, hire their own team, and manage reps across multiple stores.\n\r\nIf you want a job where you answer\ns and clock out, this is not for you. If you want to grow fast, take on real responsibility, and be part of building something from the ground up — read on.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nYou will start as a CS Representative handling customer\ns across our stores. As you demonstrate competence, reliability, and leadership, you will take on increasing responsibility until you are running the CS department yourself.\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 1 — CS Representative\n\r\n\n\r\nHandle all inbound customer service\ns across multiple e-commerce stores\n\r\nResolve customer issues including returns, refunds, damaged items, order inquiries, and complaints — following our detailed SOPs for each niche\n\r\nMaintain fast response times (target: under 4 hours during business hours)\n\r\nEscalate complex cases to management with clear notes\n\r\nLearn our products, policies, and resolution procedures inside out\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 2 — CS Manager (earned through performance)\n\r\n\n\r\nHire, train, and manage additional CS representatives as the team scales\n\r\nOwn quality control — review rep responses, identify gaps, improve processes\n\r\nRefine and update SOPs as new stores and niches are added\n\r\nReport on CS performance metrics to company leadership\n\r\nBe the first point of escalation before issues reach management\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Need to Succeed\n\r\nRequired:\n\r\n\n\r\nAt least 1 year of customer service experience, preferably in e-commerce\n\r\nExcellent written English — professional, clear, and empathetic\n\r\nComfortable handling upset or frustrated customers calmly and confidently\n\r\nStrong attention to detail — you will be following specific SOPs and every step matters\n\r\nReliable internet connection and availability during US business hours\n\r\nSelf-starter who can work independently without constant supervision\n\r\n\n\r\nBig plus if you have:\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience in e-commerce customer service (returns, refunds, disputes)\n\r\nExperience with Shopify, Gorgias, Zendesk, or similar helpdesk tools\n\r\nAny prior experience training or supervising others\n\r\nFamiliarity with handling international shipping or dropshipping complaints\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Makes This Different\n\r\nMost CS jobs are dead ends. This one has a clear and fast path upward.\n\r\nWe are a growing company that needs leaders, not just ticket-closers. You will be trained on exactly how we handle every type of customer situation across every store we run. Once you know the business inside out, the next step is managing others doing the same thing — and you will be compensated significantly more when you get there.\n\r\nWe move fast. If you perform, you will not be waiting 3 years for a promotion.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n\n\r\nStarting: $5–$10/day depending on experience\n\r\nIncrease: Fast and significant as you prove yourself and take on more responsibility\n\r\nManager level: Considerably higher — this will be discussed as you progress\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are transparent: the starting rate reflects an entry-level beginning with a small team. The growth potential and salary increase are real, not a promise we use to fill a seat. We are looking for someone who values trajectory over starting pay. \n\r\n\n\r\n*As our business grows, we increase the pay heavily.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nTo be considered, please send:\n\r\n\n\r\nA short introduction — who you are, what type of work experience you have, and why this role interests you\n\r\nAn example of how you would respond to this customer\n (write it out in full):\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\"I ordered a lamp 3 weeks ago and it looks completely different from the photos. The color is way off and I want a full refund. I'm going to leave a bad review everywhere if this isn't resolved today.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYour availability — confirm you can work business hours and list any blackout dates in the next 30 days\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications without the example response will not be reviewed. This is intentional — we want to see how you think and write before anything else.                ",

This is primarily a design and layout execution job, not a copywriting job.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf your work is high quality and your pricing is competitive, there may be an opportunity to redesign my entire website, redesign several other websites I own, and work on ongoing landing pages and funnels.
