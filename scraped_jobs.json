Our CaniCol model tests many products every month using strict rules and lean budgets. Creatives are the main fuel.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are hiring one dedicated video editor to turn existing assets into short-form ads for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work only with existing footage, b-roll, product clips, images, reviews, ad library downloads, and AI tools. Your goal is to produce 100 ads per month that give us enough shots on goal to find winning products.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is ideal if you like high-output work, clear targets, and long-term stability.\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT US AND THE CANICOL MODEL\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run a lean, volume-based dropshipping system. We test many products each month and make decisions fast based on data.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur model focuses on:\n\r\nFast product testing with controlled budgets\n\r\nHigh volume of creatives per product\n\r\nClear kill, pass, and scale rules\n\r\nAccepting some false negatives in exchange for more total tests\n\r\n\n\r\nYour edits plug directly into this engine. Your ads are what we run in Phase 1 and Phase 2 tests. When a product reaches validated status using your creatives, you earn a bonus. This aligns your work with our real goal: validated products and profitable campaigns.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe work with Slack, ClickUp or Notion, and Google Drive. You will receive clear briefs and assets, and we will give feedback based on real ad performance such as hook rate and click through rate.\n\r\n\n\r\nMAIN RESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will edit 100 short-form video ads per month. Each video is usually 15 to 35 seconds, vertical 9:16 format, for TikTok, Reels, and Shorts.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work only from existing assets. Examples include competitor ads from TikTok and Meta Ad Libraries, supplier or manufacturer videos, product b-roll, product photos, customer reviews, screenshots, stock clips, and AI generated or AI assisted clips.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will create multiple variations from the same base assets. This means trying different hooks in the first 1 to 3 seconds, different scene order and pacing, and different angles and calls to action.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will add strong direct response elements. This includes clear on screen text, readable subtitles, benefit driven captions, problem and solution framing, social proof, and urgency when appropriate.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will export files correctly and keep all files named and organized following our structure in Google Drive.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will make fast revisions when we see what is working and what is not. When a product shows good signals, we will ask you for more variations quickly so we can push it through the CaniCol gates.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED SKILLS\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have experience editing short-form vertical videos for platforms such as TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be able to edit using at least one of the following: CapCut, Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or DaVinci Resolve.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must understand pacing and hooks. You know that the first 1 to 3 seconds d\n whether people keep watching or scroll.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be comfortable working completely from existing footage and from AI tools. This is an editing and repurposing role, not a filming role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be able to create clean subtitles and on-screen text in clear English.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have a reliable computer and stable internet connection that can handle video editing work.\n\r\n\n\r\nSOFT SKILLS WE VALUE\n\r\n\n\r\nYou follow instructions very carefully and care about details such as file names and structure.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou hit deadlines and weekly output targets without needing to be chased.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are open to direct feedback and can adjust your style based on performance data and comments.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou ask questions when something is unclear instead of guessing and wasting time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou want a long-term, stable role and are not just looking for a quick project.\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION AND GROWTH\n\r\n\n\r\nPay is 150USD per month retainer in exchange for 80 edited short-form ads for the first month. After proven, retainer will increase.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou also receive a 50 USD bonus for each validated product. A product is considered validated when campaigns using your creatives hit our internal performance targets over several days at proper ad spend. We will share these rules clearly in writing so you know exactly what has to happen for a product to count as validated.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs your creatives help us find more winning products, we will review your base pay and bonus structure. There is potential for higher pay and for you to become a lead editor in the future.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe pay on time and review performance regularly.\n\r\n\n\r\nWORK SCHEDULE AND SETUP\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a part-time, long-term, remote role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can set your own schedule as long as you consistently deliver your weekly output and can overlap at least 2 to 3 hours with US Eastern Time on agreed days for feedback calls or messages.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will use Slack for communication, Google Drive for assets and exports, and ClickUp or Notion for tasks. You will use your own editing software.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nOnlineJobs.ph subject line requirement:\n\r\n\n\r\nUse this exact subject line when you apply:\n\r\nBLUE – Short-Form Ads Video Editor\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the body of your application, include the following in plain text:\n\r\n\n\r\nFirst, a short introduction of 3 to 5 sentences. Tell us who you are, your experience with short-form ads, and why a high volume, repurposing focused role like this fits you.\n\r\n\n\r\nSecond, links to 3 to 6 examples of your work. These should be vertical short-form videos. Ad style edits are preferred. You can send Google Drive links, TikTok or Instagram profiles, or YouTube links. If any of these performed well in terms of views or sales, mention that.\n\r\n\n\r\nThird, answer these questions in simple text:\n\r\nWhat editing software do you use every day?\n\r\nHow many 15 to 30 second ads can you realistically edit in a full working day at good quality?\n\r\nHave you worked with ecommerce, dropshipping, or DTC brands before? If yes, what did you do?\n\r\nHave you used TikTok or Meta Ad Library before to study or repurpose ads?\n\r\nAre you comfortable with 150$ per month base pay plus 50 USD per validated product and an output of 80-100 ads per month?\n\r\n\n\r\nFourth, describe your setup. Write your computer specs including CPU, RAM, and GPU if you have one. Also tell us your internet speed. You can paste your speedtest result if you want.\n\r\n\n\r\nFifth, optional but a big plus. You may send a 1 to 2 minute Loom or unlisted YouTube video where you show one ad you edited and explain how you built the hook, the middle, and the call to action.\n\r\n\n\r\nHIRING PROCESS\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will first review applications that follow all instructions and use the correct subject line.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will then shortlist candidates based on portfolio, clarity of answers, and fit for a high-volume testing environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nShortlisted candidates will be invited to a paid test project using our assets.\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter the test project, we will choose one editor for a one month paid trial. If both sides are happy after the trial, we will continue on a long-term basis.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want a long-term, data driven editing role where your work is directly tied to validated products and bonuses, we invite you to apply.

    "description": "\n                    About the Role\n\r\nI run a portfolio of four companies across branding, defence advisory, healthcare infrastructure, and software/AI. I need a sharp, self-directed VA to own the operational layer of business development across all four. This is not a data entry role. You will be the engine behind LinkedIn outreach, CRM pipeline management, meeting coordination,\n drafting, cold outreach campaigns, and research. You will work directly with me and my PA.\n\r\nI use AI tools (Claude) extensively and expect you to as well. If you've never used AI tools in your workflow, this isn't the right fit. If you've used them and found they make you faster and better, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Do Every Day\n\r\n- Build targeted prospect lists using Claude AI and research tools, then execute LinkedIn outreach under my account (with strict safety protocols).\n\r\n- Manage our Airtable CRM: create origination entries, move contacts through the pipeline, coordinate with my PA on meeting scheduling, and create deals when opportunities arise.\n\r\n- Draft\ns and follow-ups in my voice and tone. You'll be trained on my writing style and expected to match it closely.\n\r\n - Run structured cold outreach campaigns end-to-end: list building, template drafting, sending, tracking, and follow-up sequences.\n\r\n- Deliver daily output logs with specific activity numbers. No tracking software. Your outputs speak for themselves.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I Need From You\n\r\n- Proven VA experience supporting a founder, CEO, or senior executive. Not a team. Not a department. A person who moves fast and expects you to keep up.\n\r\n- Airtable proficiency (or the ability to learn it in days, not weeks). If you've built automations in Airtable before, say so. If you haven't but you've done similar work in \n, HubSpot, or another CRM, that counts.\n\r\n- LinkedIn outreach experience. You understand connection limits, the importance of VPN/dedicated IP, and how to write messages that don't sound like spam.\n\r\n- Strong written English. Not perfect grammar for the sake of it. I need you to write\ns that sound like a real person, not a template. Warm, direct, professional.\n\r\n- AI tool literacy. You use ChatGPT, Claude, or similar tools proactively in your work. Bonus if you've used Claude's Co-Worker/Projects features.\n\r\n- Judgment. You know the difference between something you can handle yourself, something you should flag, and something that needs to be escalated immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I Need From You\n\r\n- Proven VA experience supporting a founder, CEO, or senior executive.

Instead, reply with the following:\n\r\n- Your name and a one-paragraph summary of the most relevant VA role you've held. Specifically tell me: who you supported (founder/CEO/team), what tools you used daily, and one example of a task you owned end-to-end without needing to be managed.\n\r\n- Rate your Airtable proficiency from 1 to 10 and explain your rating in one sentence.\n\r\n- Rate your LinkedIn outreach experience from 1 to 10 and explain your rating in one sentence.\n\r\n- Have you used Claude AI (by Anthropic) before? If yes, describe one task you used it for. If no, that's fine, but say so.\n\r\nInclude the phrase \"I read the full posting\" at the very start of your application, before anything else.

Thanks! ***\n\r\n\n\r\n*** Company Description ***\n\r\nEngage Video Production (EVP) creates educational and communication focused video content, primarily for aerospace, defense, and technical clients. Our work helps high stakes organizations explain complex ideas clearly, train teams effectively, and communicate with absolute precision. We operate with a military grade standard of excellence and are looking for a Junior/Senior Video Editor who is ready to grow within a high accountability environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhile aerospace and defense are our core specialties, our projects vary widely. We need an editor who is adaptable, technically proficient, and comfortable shifting styles to meet the specific goals of a diverse client base.\n\r\n\n\r\n*** The Three Pillars of Success at EVP ***\n\r\nTo succeed here, you must embody these three core values:\n\r\n\n\r\nDiscipline: You follow through on every task without \"floundering\" or ghosting. You possess the self-discipline to manage your time and meet deadlines without constant supervision.\n\r\n\n\r\nMotivation and Dedication: You are dedicated to the mission and the company's growth. You don't just \"do a job\"; you look for ways to contribute to the overall success of the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nRadical Integrity and Accountability: You own your mistakes immediately. You have the backbone to point out errors for correction, even if they are your own, because you understand that precision is non-negotiable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n*** Role Overview *** \n\r\nWe are seeking a Full-Time Video Editor to join our team. This is a stable, 40-hour-per-week role. You will be responsible for executing the editing of active projects under the guidance of our Creative Director.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe ideal candidate can work independently on assigned tasks, manage massive amounts of data, and communicate proactively. We are looking for a professional who takes pride in technical accuracy and understanding how a project’s storytelling can achieve success for our clients.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n*** Core Responsibilities ***\n\r\nVideo Editing: Execute the editing process for short- and long-form video content from start to finish, ensuring high-quality storytelling and pacing for all client projects.\n\r\n\n\r\nMedia Management: Organize, sync, and manage large volumes of footage. You must be comfortable handling projects ranging from hundreds of gigabytes to multiple terabytes.\n\r\n\n\r\nTechnical Finishing: Perform professional color correction and grading on all deliverables. This includes managing RAW workflows and ensuring visual consistency.\n\r\n\n\r\nAudio & Sound Design: Integrate music, perform basic audio cleanup/mixing, and ensure sound design aligns with the project’s goals.\n\r\n\n\r\nVisual Polish: Apply motion graphics, titles, and lower thirds as required by the project scope to create a polished, professional product.\n\r\n\n\r\nFeedback & Coordination: Implement revisions efficiently and meet agreed-upon deadlines. You will coordinate daily with the Creative Director and, when applicable, other freelancers or editors.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n*** Required Qualifications ***\n\r\nProfessional Background: Demonstrated experience in video editing (freelance or agency). You should have a solid understanding of editing pacing, storytelling, and professional delivery formats.\n\r\n\n\r\nSoftware Proficiency: High proficiency in DaVinci Resolve or Adobe Premiere Pro. While Resolve is our preferred NLE, we welcome expert Premiere editors who can deliver professional results.\n\r\n\n\r\nTechnical Foundations: Strong grasp of audio cleanup and mixing, as well as color correction and grading workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\nRAW Workflow (Preferred): Experience editing and color grading RED RAW footage. If you haven't handled RED RAW, you must be a fast learner capable of managing complex, high-resolution media workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\nData & Infrastructure: A reliable, high-speed internet connection is non-negotiable. You will regularly receive hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes of footage and must be comfortable managing that volume of data.\n\r\n\n\r\nAutonomy & Communication: Excellent written English and a proactive approach to reporting. You must be able to work independently without micromanagement and remain vocal about timelines, challenges, and progress.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n*** Bonus / Preferred Skills ***\n\r\nMotion Graphics: Experience with Fusion, After Effects, or equivalent tools for adding visual layers.\n\r\n\n\r\nGraphic Design: Ability to create images, maps, diagrams, simple layouts, or visual explainers for complex concepts.\n\r\n\n\r\nIndustry Experience: Previous experience with educational, corporate, or technical content.\n\r\n\n\r\nCollaboration Tools: Familiarity with structured feedback and client-facing revision workflows (specifically experience with \n).\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject Matter Interest: A genuine interest in aerospace, defense, science, or complex technical subject matter.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n*** Compensation ***\n\r\nStarting at: $640 (~36,800 PHP) to $1,120 (~64,500 PHP) USD per month, based on 40 hours/week, subject to change. \n\r\n\n\r\nStarting Rate: $4.00 to $7.00 USD per hour.  [*Conversions are approximate.]\n\r\n\n\r\nRate Determination: Starting salary/rates are dependent upon experience and demonstrated skill.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nA Note on AI and Judgment\n\r\nAt EVP, we use advanced tools every day. However, this role requires high level human judgment and Radical Integrity. We are hiring a human, not a prompt. If you use AI to draft your personal responses on the “How to Apply” section, you are failing the first test of this role: Honesty. We want to hear your real thoughts and see your real personality to ensure you will be a good fit on our team. If your application lacks a unique human voice, it will be discarded. Use AI to assist your workflow later; do not use it to represent your character now.\n\r\n\n\r\n*** How to Apply ***\n\r\nTo be considered, you must follow these steps exactly. Attention to details is a requirement for this role.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Change your subject line to: \"Motivated Video Editor – [Your Name]\".\n\r\n\n\r\n-Must use a minimum of 7 apply points (AP)\n\r\n\n\r\n-Provide a link to your best and most current video editing work (to include any additional skills you want to highlight, such as motion graphic heavy editing, etc.)  No portfolio = no consideration.\n\r\n\n\r\n-In exactly two sentences, describe your experience  level with RED RAW footage? If none, how do you plan to manage the learning curve and hardware demands of high-resolution RAW media?  Use plain English; no AI-generated fluff.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Attach or link to your CV/resume.  Must be in PDF format only.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Want to really stand out? Record a 60-second video (Loom or similar) introducing yourself. Tell me why you are the right pick and what about Aerospace & Defense interests you. Start the video by addressing me by name (Ryan). Applicants who include this video move to the top of the list.\n\r\n\n\r\nThanks for your time and genuine interest!                ",

Because of that, we suggest that you give us thoughtful responses and rich stories. We typically only interview applicants who give rich and detailed answers to our questions. If you write short responses so that you can hurry up and finish the application, you will not get interviewed.\n\r\n2) Tell us stories about how your actions match your beliefs and values. For example, if I say I value health and fitness, you don't know if I'm telling you the truth or if I'm just telling you what sounds good. But, if I tell you things I've done, I can illustrate my values of health and fitness with proof. For example, I go to the gym 4 days per week, I've done 6 triathlons, including an Ironman, and I can swim 3000 meters in one hour. My examples of things I've done prove that my actions match my values system.\n\r\n3) Be vulnerable and honest. We take very detailed notes during the interview process, and we conduct extensive background checks. If the stories you tell about yourself don't match what your references say, we will not hire you. We'd rather hire a C student who is honest about being a C student than someone who is a C student but tries to pass themselves off as an A student. Remember, this is an entry-level job. We're not looking for perfect. We're looking for an excellent cultural fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply: Please click on the link: \n/work-opportunities/administration-agent                ",

You’re a retention-minded builder.\n\r\n- You have strong taste and you know what “boring” looks like in the first 30 seconds\n\r\n- You think in terms of viewer psychology: curiosity, \nntum, payoff, pattern breaks, cognitive load\n\r\n- You can take a messy timeline and make it feel inevitable\n\r\n- You’re fast because you’re systematic, not because you rush\n\r\n- You’re the kind of person who says:\n\r\n       “We can cut 20% of this and make it hit harder”\n\r\n       “That visual doesn’t match what he’s saying”\n\r\n       \"We need a state change here or retention will dip”\n\r\n- You’re comfortable working with a founder-led brand (direct feedback, high standards, iterative improvement)\n\r\n- You communicate cleanly: brief updates, clear questions, no drama\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n- Proven experience editing YouTube long-form content with strong pacing (please include portfolio links)\n\r\n- Strong command of Premiere Pro / DaVinci Resolve (Final Cut ok if you’re excellent)\n\r\n- Solid audio handling: EQ, noise reduction, leveling, basic mastering\n\r\n- Ability to implement feedback quickly and accurately\n\r\n- Comfortable working during PH time overlap (1pm–10pm PH)\n\r\n- Can deliver consistently (this is a full-time workload, not “a few hours a week”)\n\r\n- Organized file management and version control habits (clean project files, naming conventions, exports)\n\r\n- Familiarity with AI tools for:\n\r\n     graphics generation\n\r\n     faster asset creation\n\r\n     transcript-based editing / cut detection / ideation support\n\r\n- Reliable internet + a machine that can handle heavy editing\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Points If You...\n\r\n- Have edited content in B2B,  SEO / marketing / business / technical niches (where clarity matters more than flashy edits)\n\r\n- Know how to read retention graphs and make surgical improvements\n\r\n- Can build motion templates (After Effects) or clean UI-style animations\n\r\n- Have a good eye for brand consistency (fonts, spacing, hierarchy, visual cleanliness)\n\r\n- Can help improve our editing SOPs and make the process faster every month\n\r\n\n\r\nHave experience with:\n\r\n- Descript / Premiere text-based editing\n\r\n- Runway / Pika / Midjourney / Photoshop AI (or equivalents)\n\r\n- Caption workflows that don’t look cheesy\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Get\n\r\n- USD\n/ month based on skills and experience\n\r\n- Remote-first, async-friendly culture — results over hours\n\r\n- Real autonomy and real impact — this is your department to build\n\r\n- A sharp team, strong values (Competence, Adaptability, Trust, Collaboration, Humanity), and no fluff\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply (Follow These Steps Precisely)\n\r\nPlease\n the following to \n with the subject:\n\r\n“Video Editor – I’m [Your Name] and I edit high-retention content.”\n\r\nInclude:\n\r\n    Your resume with two professional references\n\r\n    Your DISC profile (free test at \n)\n\r\n    Your portfolio (2–5 examples most relevant to retention + long-form)\n\r\n    A short note: what makes your edits retain attention?\n\r\n    Which tools you use (editing + AI)\n\r\n    Your monthly rate expectation (USD range) and availability\n\r\n    (Optional but strong) A 30–60s “before/after” showing how you improved pacing on a clip                ",

This is a long-term position with clearly documented systems already in place. You will not be building anything from scratch — you will be executing proven processes daily.\n\r\nBrand 1: Professional Services Firm (Bookkeeping, Accounting & Cash Flow Management)\n\r\nThis brand serves medium-sized business owners generating $500K–$5M in annual revenue. Your responsibilities include:\n\r\n\n\r\nManaging my personal calendar, coordinating meetings, sending reminders, and handling scheduling conflicts before I have to ask.\n\r\nGrowing my LinkedIn account by posting provided content, engaging with prospects, and running connection campaigns targeting business owners, CEOs, founders, and operations managers in that revenue range. You will use LinkedIn automation tools (we currently use Meet Alfred but are open to your recommendation if you can back it up with results).\n\r\nThe goal is simple: build a network of business owners who need accounting, bookkeeping, and cash flow management services. You post, you engage, you grow the audience. Content will be provided.\n\r\n\n\r\nBrand 2: Music Artist Management\n\r\nThis brand manages a Nashville-based country music artist who performs with a full band and is actively booking paid shows across five U.S. states. Your responsibilities include:\n\r\n\n\r\nExecuting a pre-built venue outreach system. There are 624 venue contacts loaded into a spreadsheet with a full\n Playbook and SOP already written. Every\n is pre-written. You customize the placeholders, send on schedule, and log every touchpoint. You do not write or rewrite anything.\n\r\nGrowing the artist's LinkedIn account by posting provided content and running connection campaigns targeting venue booking managers, talent buyers, promoters, event coordinators, festival organizers, and music industry professionals. Same approach — post, engage, grow.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Requires Every Day:\n\r\n\n\r\nFollow documented SOPs and Playbooks exactly as written. No improvising.\n\r\nSend 30–50 outreach\ns per day on a structured schedule and log every send same-day.\n\r\nPost and engage on two LinkedIn accounts using automation tools.\n\r\nManage my calendar and flag conflicts or gaps proactively.\n\r\nCommunicate clearly. If something is unclear, ask before you act.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Do NOT Need To Do:\n\r\n\n\r\nWrite\ns or marketing copy. Everything is pre-written.\n\r\nCreate content. It will all be provided to you.\n\r\nMake strategic decisions. We handle strategy. You handle execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Will Make You Stand Out:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou have real experience with LinkedIn automation tools — Meet Alfred, Linked Helper, Expandi, or similar.\n\r\nYou have managed\n outreach sequences before and understand follow-up timing and tracking.\n\r\nYou are organized enough to manage two brands without mixing things up.\n\r\nYou work during U.S. Central Time business hours with at least 4–6 hours of overlap.\n\r\nYou treat this like a career, not a task list.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you read this entire post, include the word \"828\" somewhere in your application so we know.

Human. Clear.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’re reading this and thinking,\n\r\n“Wait. That’s literally me.”\n\r\nKeep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY THIS ROLE EXISTS\n\r\n\n\r\nSGEN is building something better.\n\r\n\n\r\nBut here’s the truth:\n\r\n\n\r\nIt doesn’t matter how good a product is if no one understands it.\n\r\nWe need someone who makes SGEN understandable to the outside world.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen someone Googles a question at 1:14 AM — frustrated, stuck, ready to quit —\n\r\n they shouldn’t find silence.\n\r\n\n\r\nThey should find you.\n\r\n\n\r\nClear answers.\n\r\nHonest comparisons.\n\r\nStep-by-step guidance.\n\r\nA voice that sounds like a smart friend, not a corporate manual.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are the bridge between complexity and clarity.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO YOU ARE\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re naturally curious.\n\r\nIf something doesn’t have documentation, you don’t wait to be assigned. You fix it.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou open a product and instinctively think:\n\r\n“This needs a getting-started guide.”\n\r\n“That error message needs explaining.”\n\r\n“New users will get stuck here.”\n\r\n\n\r\nYou remember what it felt like to not know what a CMS was.\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd when you explain it, you don’t use jargon.\n\r\nYou don’t flex vocabulary.\n\r\nYou just make it make sense.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour writing feels like a conversation over coffee.\n\r\nNot stiff.\n\r\nNot robotic.\n\r\nNot AI-generated.\n\r\nJust clear.\n\r\n\n\r\nYOU HAVE OPINIONS (AND THAT'S GOOD)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou probably have thoughts about WordPress architecture.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou might love it.\n\r\nYou might be tired of it.\n\r\nYou definitely have stories.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe don’t need neutral.\n\r\nWe don’t need safe.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone who can say:\n\r\n“Here’s why this is broken.”\n\r\n“Here’s why this is better.”\n\r\n“And here’s where we still need to improve.”\n\r\n\n\r\nFair. Honest. Confident.\n\r\n\n\r\nNot loud. Not defensive.\n\r\n\n\r\nJust grounded in real experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nYOU'RE NOT FRAGILE ONLINE\n\r\n\n\r\nReddit can be brutal.\n\r\n\n\r\nBlog comments can be snarky.\n\r\n\n\r\nSomeone will say:\n\r\n“SGEN is just another startup that’ll be dead in a year.”\n\r\n\n\r\nYou don’t panic.\n\r\nYou don’t rage-reply.\n\r\nYou don’t disappear.\n\r\nYou respond with clarity and calm.\n\r\n\n\r\nBecause you know the difference between criticism and noise.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL ACTUALLY DO\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll dive deep into SGEN.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll build test sites. Break things. Explore edges.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll document:\n\r\n- The first-click experience\n\r\n- The confusing parts\n\r\n- The missing explanations\n\r\n- The friction\n\r\n\n\r\nThen you’ll write:\n\r\n\n\r\nClear documentation.\n\r\nStep 1. Step 2. Screenshot. Expected result.\n\r\n\n\r\nBlog posts that actually say something.\n\r\nNot filler. Not fluff. Not SEO sludge.\n\r\n\n\r\nComparison pages that feel honest.\n\r\nGuides that prevent support tickets.\n\r\nReddit answers that genuinely help someone.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll publish consistently. Weekly. Reliably.\n\r\nBecause content works through rhythm, not bursts.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT MATTERS MOST\n\r\nNative-level written English.\n\r\nNot technically correct — natural.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen someone in the US reads your writing, they shouldn’t think,\n\r\n“Oh, this was written overseas.”\n\r\n\n\r\nThey should think,\n\r\n“This person gets it.”\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ve built WordPress sites for at least 2 years.\n\r\nNot theory. Not tutorials. Real clients. Real mess.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand:\n\r\n- Plugin conflicts\n\r\n- Theme weirdness\n\r\n- Hosting nightmares\n\r\n- Security scares\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd when you write about them, it’s fro\nmory — not Google.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can write both:\n\r\n- A bold opinion piece\n\r\n and\n\r\n- A precise technical guide.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand basic SEO — not in a spammy way, but structurally.\n\r\nYou know what helps content rank without making it unreadable.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can screenshot. Screen record. Annotate.\n\r\nBecause visual tools deserve visual documentation.\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd most importantly:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou edit yourself.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou don’t ship first drafts.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou refine.

We are a small, tight-knit team that values quality over quantity, clear communication, and people who take ownership of their work.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nWe are looking for a full-time website and page designer to own the visual design layer across all of our clients. Everything that goes on a client’s website starts with your design in Figma. You will be the person responsible for how every client’s website and strategic pages look before they go to development.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a dedicated, full-time position. We are not looking for freelancers juggling multiple clients. We need someone who is fully committed to our team and available during working hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Be Doing\n\r\n• Website design for all clients — homepage redesigns, new website builds, landing page designs, and any other page design work. All designs live in Figma.\n\r\n• Strategic page design — pillar pages, service pages, and city/geo landing pages. These are high-impact pages that drive SEO rankings and conversions. You will create design templates per client for each page type so new pages can be produced efficiently while staying visually consistent.\n\r\n• Design QA — after the developer builds your designs, you review the live build against your Figma to make sure everything matches. You catch what’s off before it goes live.\n\r\n• Conversion optimization — you design with conversions in mind. CTA placement, visual hierarchy, form positioning, and trust signals. When data shows a page isn’t converting, you’ll adjust the design based on what the SEO strategist flags.\n\r\n• Social media graphics — static post designs for client social media accounts. Consistent brand design across platforms.\n\r\n• Collaboration — you’ll work closely with our content writer, SEO strategist, and developer. Communication happens in Slack and you’re expected to be responsive during working hours.\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n• Proficient in Figma — this is our primary design tool. Everything you create lives here.\n\r\n• Website design experience — you understand layout, spacing, typography, and how to design pages that look professional and convert visitors into leads.\n\r\n• Mobile-first design — every design must account for both desktop and mobile. This is non-negotiable.\n\r\n• Attention to detail — pixel-level precision matters. When you hand off a design to development, it should be clean and complete.\n\r\n• Strong communication — you respond promptly in Slack, ask questions when something is unclear, and flag issues before they become problems.\n\r\n• Reliable and consistent — you show up, you meet deadlines, and you don’t need to be chased for updates.\n\r\n• Able to take direction and also think independently — we’ll give you briefs and feedback, but we also want you to bring your own design perspective and speak up when you see something that could be better.\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have\n\r\n• Experience designing for WordPress or Elementor-based websites\n\r\n• Understanding of basic SEO principles (headings, CTAs, page structure)\n\r\n• Experience creating infographics or data visualizations\n\r\n• Familiarity with brand identity and style guide creation\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n• Fixed monthly salary — no tracking hours, no guessing what your paycheck will be. Stable, predictable income every month.\n\r\n• Long-term position — we are not hiring for a project. We want someone who grows with the team.\n\r\n• Clear role and ownership — you own the design layer across every client. Your work is valued and visible.\n\r\n• Small team, real impact — you’re not a number. Your input matters and your work directly affects our clients’ results.\n\r\n• Room to grow — as we expand social media and take on new clients, your role and responsibilities will grow with the agency.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nDo not send your resume as I am not interested in that but your work. \n\r\n\n\r\n• A link to your portfolio or Figma projects showing website design work (not just logos or social media graphics — we need to see full page designs)\n\r\n• A brief message telling us about your experience and why you’re a good fit\n\r\n• Your availability to start\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications without a portfolio will not be considered.

    "description": "\n                    I'm an Australian business owner looking for an experienced Xero bookkeeper with strong knowledge of the Australian tax system to reconcile 18 months of transactions across two separate entities — a partnership (tied to a personal ABN) and a Pty Ltd company. Both entities are GST registered and operate in professional services.\n\r\nThis is a project-based role with a clear path to regular ongoing work if you do a great job.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Scope\n\r\nThe company generates roughly 5–10 transactions per day. The partnership generates 1–3 per day. Neither entity has been reconciled — we're starting from scratch across approximately 18 months. In total you're likely looking at 3,000–5,000+ transactions across both files.\n\r\nYour job is to get both Xero files clean, correctly categorised, and ready for my BAS agent to review and lodge. You do not need to lodge anything yourself.\n\r\n\n\r\nSpecifically you will:\n\r\n\n\r\nReconcile all bank transactions across both Xero entities from the start\n\r\nCategorise expenses to the correct accounts using the right Australian chart of accounts\n\r\nApply correct GST tax codes (GST, GST-free, BAS excluded, input-taxed) to all transactions\n\r\nProactively identify and flag legitimate business expenses that can be claimed — I want to make sure nothing is missed\n\r\nFlag any transactions you're unsure about so I can clarify — I'm available for questions throughout\n\r\nDeliver both files in a state where my BAS agent can go straight to lodgement without cleaning up behind you\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I'm Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nMinimum 3 years experience bookkeeping for Australian clients or working within an Australian accounting firm or BPO\n\r\nDeep understanding of Australian GST — not just how to apply codes, but knowing what's claimable and what isn't for a professional services business\n\r\nXero proficient — bank reconciliation, tax codes, chart of accounts, and working across multiple separate organisations\n\r\nSomeone who works independently but communicates clearly when they have questions\n\r\nDetail-oriented — I'd rather you ask than guess\n\r\n\n\r\nScreening Question — Required\n\r\nApplications without this will not be considered.\n\r\nIn your own words, explain: what is GST, how does it apply to a registered Australian business, and what is a BAS? Also briefly describe how you would approach reconciling a Xero file that has had no reconciliation done from the start.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply Include:\n\r\n\n\r\nYour CV with specific Australian clients or firms you've worked with\n\r\nYour answer to the screening question above\n\r\nYour proposed project rate (fixed fee preferred, or hourly with an estimated total)\n\r\nYour availability and how quickly you could start\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Happens After You Apply\n\r\nShortlisted candidates will be given a small paid test task — approximately 20–30 sample transactions to categorise. This is paid and takes around 30–60 minutes. It's the fastest way for both of us to know if it's a good fit before committing to the full project.\n\r\nStrong performers on this project will be offered regular ongoing bookkeeping work.

    "description": "\n                    We're not looking for someone who's \"pretty good.\" We need someone who's obsessive about details.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe kind of person who notices when an image is 2 pixels off. Who reads a caption four times before hitting publish. Who finds typos that spell-check misses. If you've been called \"picky\" or \"perfectionist\" before—and you took it as a compliment—keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Actually Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\nRight now, we have two core needs. More will come as you grow with us.\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Social Media Scheduling in \n\r\n\n\r\nUpload posts across Instagram,\n, GMB, X, and Pinterest. Add images, captions, alt tags—and make sure everything is polished before it goes live. You'll work inside Sprout Social, which handles all platforms in one place. If you haven't used Sprout, we'll train you. And the skills will make you more marketable if we ever part ways.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Web Content in WordPress + Elementor\n\r\n\n\r\nPlace content on pages. Follow our standards for styling, spacing, image handling, and metadata. You’ll also create and categorize pages intelligently. If you've used Elementor before, great. If not, we'll train you—but you need to be comfortable in WordPress already. You do not need to be a designer, but you need to know if something looks good or not. \n\r\n\n\r\nThat's the work. It's repetitive. It requires focus. And it must be nearly error-free because our clients have zero tolerance for sloppy presentation. We're saying that out loud so you can self-select. If you thrive on variety and hate repeating tasks, or you’re just looking for something to pay you, this isn't for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nVital info: In your application, use this phrase somewhere so we know you actually read this: \"detail-driven\"\n\r\n\n\r\nWe expect general competencies in typing, Google Workspace, Gmail, Google Drive, and all of the other Google Apps. We also expect you to be self-managed and proactive. You should expect that out of yourself as well. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou may have other VA-type tasks assigned to you as well. We may even need some assistance with AI in writing and running assessments and checks. Have a background in SEO or design? Let us know!\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We're Hoping to Find\n\r\n\n\r\nWe realize our budget is entry-level. We're not hiding that. What we offer in exchange: real training, meaningful work, and a long-term home if you're the COMMITTED kind of person who grows with the companies you join. We've built this agency on relationships, not revolving doors. If you’re younger and getting going, come aboard. If you’re more experienced but without work, read on…\n\r\n\n\r\nSo who fits?\n\r\n\n\r\n• A social media manager who wants hands-on experience with Sprout and a more technical workflow.\n\r\n• A web designer or WordPress builder who wants more exposure to other areas of digital marketing and content strategy.\n\r\n• A VA or data entry professional looking to level up into WordPress, Elementor, and real marketing projects.\n\r\n• A project manager or strategist between gigs who wants to get your foot in the door and prove your skills—even if the starting rate is lower than you'd normally take. Come show your value and we may have another place for you. \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're motivated, reliable, and obsessively detail-oriented? We want to hear from you.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n• Equipped with a reliable computer and stable internet connection\n\r\n• Able to meet via video call 2–3x per week with management (up to 5 the first few weeks)\n\r\n• Willing to produce brief daily reports in our time-tracking software\n\r\n• Comfortable learning new industry-leading online tools (we'll train the right person)\n\r\n• Available 4–8 hours per day, consistently (you can let us know what works for you)\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n\n\r\nUSD $3-$4/hour depending on experience (starting). We pay bi-weekly initially to get you some fuel and build trust for the 1st three pay periods and monthly thereafter. There's room to grow as you prove yourself—this is meant to be a long-term fit, not a quick gig.\n\r\n\n\r\nWant a Long-Term Career?\n\r\n\n\r\nWe take our investments in our partners seriously. Ideally, we’d like this to work ou,t and you continue without agency. Here’s how it works:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe Dance, We Date, We Marry: All independent contractors entering our organization enter into a probationary period of one month, followed by three months (minimum) before we commit to anything longer. We operate in this manner to determine fit, climate/cultural countenance, and to ensure you are in “the right seat on the bus.”\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not reply here with a generic message. We will not respond.\n\r\n\n\r\nInstead:\n\r\n\n\r\nSubmit your application via this form: \n\r\n\n\r\nThen reply here to confirm you submitted the form.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you only reply here without using the form, your application won't be considered. You’d be amazed at how many people on here don’t follow directions and keep following up.  \n\r\n\n\r\nThanks!                ",

We're not seeking rabbit chasers, \n\r\n\n\r\nWe have a small and focused marketing agency that works for a few products and personal brands. We need a skilled editor who is also an artist... \n\r\n\n\r\nYou have high competency in Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and the Adobe Suite... as well as the technicalities of video production, media sizes, audio clean-up, etc. We find the best post-production creatives typically play in many areas, such as photography, design, motion, drawing, painting, etc. Share your passions for us to have a great sense of who you are. \n\r\n\n\r\nIdeally, you have a strong portfolio in animation and a good sense of graphic design principles. And you know how to manage files in a professional workflow.\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd most of all, you are intuitive and versatile. You know that millisecond when to cut between words... You know how to select an appropriate stock b-roll clip and can choose a song to match the objective. You LOVE having all the tools with flexibility for your creativity to flourish, yet you have a solid track record of moving projects to completion. \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you primarily stick to lighter tools such as Canva and phone app-based editing programs, we're not a fit. We'll be asking about your computer's specs, your upload speed, and other requirements for more experienced designers. If you also know when and how to use them \n\r\n\n\r\nShow us your best work. Looking for portfolios with both animation and editing, but open to people who may have a specialization in one or the other. In terms of animation and design style, our initial project will be with simple, minimal graphics that are intelligently orchestrated with philosophical insights. \n\r\n\n\r\nAll applicants who we feel may be a fit will be hired for 1-3 paid test projects. We'll invest in seeing if we are a fit because we are determining how much project management and input we'll need to have in the early stages. Ideally, we're looking for someone who wants to grow and evolve with our unique, potent, growing agency for many years. If you're a proactive self-starter who \"gets it,\" write us. \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you have a friend or two you love working with, we're also open to hiring a team. Pay will be determined on your competency, productivity, and overall efficiency. We are rapidly expanding in video production, so there is an opportunity to start part-time and grow into something greater. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply: Prepare your portfolio and info. Then follow the instructions below. \n\r\n\n\r\n1) You must submit your application via this link: \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n2) Reply here to notify us that you've submitted. Note: if you only reply here, you will not get a response and your application won't be considered.

We need a video editor who lives and breathes direct-response — someone who understands that every frame has a job to do, and that job is to sell.\n\r\nThis isn't a creative passion project. It's performance-driven work where your edits are measured against real results — clicks, conversions, and revenue.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Looks Like\n\r\n\n\r\nRemote, anywhere in the world\n\r\nPer-ad compensation — you're paid for output, not hours\n\r\n5–10 ads per week — fast-paced but sustainable if you have a system\n\r\nOngoing work with room to grow as we scale\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\nEditing short-form video ads (20–60 seconds) built to stop the scroll and drive purchases\n\r\nTurning raw UGC footage into polished, high-performing creatives\n\r\nBuilding strong hooks, tight pacing, and visual storytelling that moves people to act\n\r\nSourcing B-roll and reference clips from TikTok, Adspy, and Pipiads\n\r\nAdding captions, SFX, music, and transitions that feel native to the feed\n\r\nUsing 11 Labs for voiceovers and audio — this is a core part of the workflow, not a nice-to-have\n\r\nCollaborating on creative angles and scripts when needed\n\r\nStaying current on what's winning in direct-response and short-form content\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're the Right Fit If:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou have a real portfolio of Meta or TikTok ads — not just general video work\n\r\nYou've edited UGC content specifically, and you know how to make it feel authentic while still converting\n\r\nYou're fluent in CapCut, Premiere Pro, Final Cut, or DaVinci Resolve\n\r\nYou've used 11 Labs in actual client or brand projects\n\r\nYou're familiar with Claude AI for scripting and ideation\n\r\nYou work fast without cutting corners — speed is part of the skill set here\n\r\nYou don't need hand-holding on briefs. You can take a concept and run with it\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't for you if you need weeks of feedback cycles, prefer slow methodical editing, or don't have proven ad experience specifically.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nStart your message with the word \"STORM\" — applications without it won't be reviewed.\n\r\nThen answer the following:\n\r\n\n\r\nHave you edited ads for an e-commerce brand? Name the product type, your role, and what the ads were trying to accomplish.\n\r\nShare your portfolio. Which piece are you most proud of — and what made it work?\n\r\nWalk us through one ad from brief to final cut. What was the challenge, and how did you solve it?\n\r\nHow have you used 11 Labs? Be specific — what projects, what use case, what result?\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWe move fast and we respond to strong applicants quickly. If your work is good, you'll hear from us.                ",

Across all of them, we move fast, build with cutting-edge AI tools, and ship features at startup speed.\n\r\n\n\r\nBut speed without quality is just chaos. That's where you come in.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're looking for an experienced QA Tester on a contract basis, someone we can call on to thoroughly test new features, hunt down bugs, and make sure everything works before it hits our users.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe build fast using AI-powered development tools, which means new features land constantly. Your job is to make sure nothing slips through the cracks. You'll be the last line of defense before our users see anything, and you'll be critical to us confidently launching our product.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a flexible, ongoing contract, workload will vary depending on development cycles. Some weeks will be busy with feature releases and launch testing; other weeks may be lighter. We're looking for someone who can be responsive when needed and is happy with a variable workload. For the right person, there's potential for this to grow into a longer-term or more regular arrangement as the product scales.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't just \"click around and see what happens.\" We need someone who thinks systematically, documents thoroughly, and can test across different devices, browsers, operating systems, and user scenarios. If you find a broken button before a customer does, you've done your job.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\n-Manually test web app and mobile app features across multiple browsers, devices, and operating systems\n\r\n-Create and maintain detailed test cases and test plans for new and existing features\n\r\n-Perform regression testing after releases to ensure existing functionality still works\n\r\n-Log bugs with clear, reproducible steps, screenshots, and device/browser details\n\r\n-Test across different user roles, permissions, and real-world scenarios\n\r\n-Verify fixes and track issues through to resolution\n\r\n-Work closely with the development team to communicate issues and priorities\n\r\n-Help build and maintain our QA checklists and documentation\n\r\n-Identify patterns in recurring bugs (hardware-specific, browser-specific, user-type-specific)\n\r\n-Support exploratory testing - actively try to break things in ways real users would\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll Thrive Here If You…\n\r\n\n\r\n-Have a sharp eye for detail and a low tolerance for \"it's probably fine\"\n\r\n-Think like a user - you can anticipate how different people on different devices will interact with software\n\r\n-Are methodical and organised in how you document and track issues\n\r\n-Communicate clearly - your bug reports are so good a developer can reproduce the issue in minutes\n\r\n-Have experience testing web applications and mobile apps (iOS and Android)\n\r\n-Understand cross-browser and cross-device testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge - desktop and mobile)\n\r\n-Are familiar with bug tracking tools (e.g., \n, Jira, or similar)\n\r\n-Can jump in quickly when needed and turn around testing within agreed timeframes\n\r\n-Are reliable and responsive - when we need you, we need to know you're available\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have (But Not Required)\n\r\n\n\r\n-Experience with test automation tools (Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, or similar)\n\r\n-Familiarity with developer tools (browser console, network tab) to help diagnose issues\n\r\n-Understanding of responsive design and how apps should behave across screen sizes\n\r\n-Experience in a startup or fast-paced environment where things change quickly\n\r\n\n\r\nHow This Works\n\r\n\n\r\n-Contract basis - paid hourly or per testing cycle, depending on what works best\n\r\n-Workload will vary, we'll give you as much notice as possible when testing is needed\n\r\n-You'll need your own devices for testing (we can discuss specifics)\n\r\n-We communicate primarily via Slack and \n\r\n-Australian business hours overlap preferred but not required for every task\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a contract role, not a full-time position but we're looking for someone who wants to build a long-term working relationship with us. We want a go-to person we can rely on, not a one-off freelancer.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're already juggling too many clients to be responsive when we need you, this probably isn't the right fit. We need someone who can prioritise our work when testing cycles come up.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n-Flexible, ongoing work with a fast-moving team\n\r\n-The chance to shape QA processes from the ground up\n\r\n-Work with modern AI-powered development tools and workflows\n\r\n-Potential to grow into a more regular or permanent role as the product scales\n\r\n-A team culture built on curiosity, accountability, and fun                ",
