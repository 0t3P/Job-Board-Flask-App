You should be as comfortable in PHP and server config as you are in CSS and animations.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll start part time (30 hours/week). For the right person, this role grows into a technical full time lead position.

Not just committing to main\n\r\nAI coding tools this is critical. We expect you to use Claude Code, Cursor, or similar AI tools daily. Not as a crutch, but as a force multiplier. If you're not already using AI in your development workflow, this isn't the right fit\n\r\nDocumentation habits you write code comments, maintain READMEs, and document architecture decisions. We never want to be in a position where only you understand how something is built\n\r\nIndependence you can take a brief, ask smart questions, and deliver without constant oversight\n\r\nAttention to detail pixel level precision on implementation.

You'll have input into how we set these up\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Standards\n\r\nWe're moving away from an external agency because their output consistently didn't meet our standards. To be direct about what that means:\n\r\n\n\r\nA page duplication with copy and image swaps should take 2–3 hours, not 20\n\r\nA loading animation should actually loop until the page is ready, not play once and show a black screen\n\r\nIf you're building ACF sections, they should be modular enough to reuse across pages without rebuilding from scratch every time\n\r\nCode should be clean, commented, documented, and structured — not 150 lines of inline CSS with no explanation\n\r\nIf something will take longer than expected, we want to know upfront with a clear explanation — not a post-hoc justification\n\r\nEvery project should have a README. Every architectural decision should be documented. We will never again be in a position where only one person or team understands how something works\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're not unreasonable. We understand complexity.

    "description": "\n                    Please read the ENTIRE description.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur previous candidate couldn't continue due to personal life problems so we're now ONLY looking for VERY dedicated members with experience in CapCut and other AI tools mentioned. This opportunity is seriously much better than it sounds at first glance!\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nA few words about us\n\r\n\n\r\nHey! We are Organic Media, a micro-agency creating and distributing educational and engaging AI-generated short-form videos for e-commerce brands, mainly in the pet niche.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll work directly with our amazing manager ( 20 years old from Europe, with over 3 years of real experience in this exact space ), who has personally prepared step-by-step tutorials on Loom to teach you everything from the ground up.\n\r\nNo confusion. No guessing. No wasted time. ( Most team members learned the workflow within a few days and are now working fully independently )\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat kind of videos will you create?\n\r\nSimple UGC-like short-form videos fully based on the provided scripts by us ( you might just need to tweak a few words if needed ) which look realistic and feel \"natural\" to the viewers on platforms like YouTube Shorts, Instagram or Facebook. Some of them are silently advertising products at the end but the key is that it doesn't sound like an ad but rather a native short-form video which a real person/influencer would record with their iPhone. There are a few styles such as just a calm \"sit down\" video ( where there's only one image and the influencer would just talk for 2 minutes ) or other ones where there're a few \"shots\" of them with a few seconds each and the scenes change but it's really not difficult at all - just a few more generations and then connecting them in CapCut.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe process is straightforward:\n\r\nGetting our scripts ready and approved, using your own creativity and generating high quality base images using tools like Nano Banana Pro, turning these images into video clips using platforms like Veo3, Kling or HeyGen and for voice ElevenLabs, cuts and trimming, other minor adjustments such as background audio effects if needed ( like supermarket background audio ). Whole process is 90% just creating the right images/video clips etc, we might not even do transitions or captions so there won't be much editing skill needed. Everything is shown clearly in the training.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be creating a lot of videos a day but these are not complex edits AT ALL. Difficulty level: 6/10 ( again, 80% is just generating the rate \"input\" images and later just animating them with voice. That's it )\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHere are visual examples of what the videos look like ( NOT OURS ):\n\r\n1. www.instagram.com/reel/DTty7hsAHe_/\n\r\n2. www.instagram.com/reel/DT0R9KgDkuW/\n\r\n3. www.instagram.com/reel/DSc75hsDQV6/\n\r\n4. www.instagram.com/reel/DT8pDFngXfp/\n\r\n5. www.instagram.com/reel/DUOAHm3kY7P/\n\r\n\n\r\n( In your application, let us know your thoughts, do you think you can easily recreate them - what tools would you use and why? )\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTraining & onboarding ( this is the biggest advantage )\n\r\nOnce hired, you will receive structured video tutorials. In total, we have a few hours available, though most people don’t need all of it. The workflow is clear so no missing steps and no “figure it out yourself.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nDaily workload ( important )\n\r\nYou’ll create around 10 to 20+ videos per day ( 1 to 2 min long - we’ll start with a smaller amount and later increase it - won't negatively affect your monthly pay. We just want to make it easier for you to start - ultimately we'll be doing 20+ but making sure it's under 8-10h a day, at first it may take you longer and we may work harder - but once learned it easily becomes manageable ).\n\r\nIn reality, you'd have exactly 4 unique \"AI influencers\" but all of 4 them have the same scripts to use, you'd just need to change a few words to help with the context ( some of them might be talking only about \"dogs\" but some about \"cats\" so just need to change a few words to make it all make sense ) and you could use the same image prompts to generate almost identical images for each influencer. In reality it’s just 2 to 6 original videos PER INFLUENCER ( 4 of them ) and each with a very similar structure. Once trained, this is very manageable.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour job is simple:\n\r\nCreate the videos, export them, and send them to us daily on Discord.\n\r\nThat’s it. No posting. No account management. No stress.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nEquipment & storage ( we make this easy )\n\r\nYou’ll need a good computer that can smoothly handle 1080p/light 4k video editing ( we’ll do 1080p but we’re going to work on multiple browser tabs ), a stable internet connection, and at least 16GB of RAM and 250GB+ of fast storage AVAILABLE. 1TB+ of SSD storage is preferred ( make sure it’s SSD and not old and slow HDD ).\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you need to buy storage/RAM ( for example, a 1TB SSD for around $100 ), we will refund you. This is required ONLY to save you time and speed up your workflow so you can be more efficient since it can be a couple GB of files a day ( you can later remove them after sending them to us. )\n\r\n\n\r\nThere also may be small subscription costs which you’d have to cover later if needed ( only around $10 a month ) for services like iCloud+ on iPhone/iPad or Discord Nitro - we refund those as well.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTools & software ( HUGE upside )\n\r\nYou get FREE access to ALL paid tools that cost us hundreds of dollars per month, including:\n\r\n- AI avatar tools like HeyGen or Veo3,\n\r\n- Copywriting software like ChatGPT+, Grok or Claude,\n\r\n- Editing software like CapCut PRO on Desktop,\n\r\n- and our CUSTOM voice-over tools like ElevenLabs,\n\r\nWe provide logins, instructions, and full support.\n\r\n( ALL OF THEM ARE WORTH $500+ MONTHLY )\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWork environment & communication\n\r\nYou’ll have a private 1:1 chat with our manager and separate one to send your daily work in, work fully remotely through Discord, receive clear feedback, and be treated as a long-term team member, not disposable labor.\n\r\nNo stressful interviews. No micromanagement. No slow emails back and forth.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nResponsibilities\n\r\n- Adjust our scripts for the context\n\r\n- Create videos from start to finish.\n\r\n- Export and send them.\n\r\n- Apply feedback and improve.\n\r\n- Prepare scripts for the next day.\n\r\n- Organize files properly.\n\r\n- Communicate clearly.\n\r\n- Hit deadlines without reminders.\n\r\nThat’s it. Simple, repetitive, and enjoyable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis job is perfect for you if\n\r\nYou’re looking for long-term stability ( months or years ), you’re willing to learn, tech-savvy, creative, organized, and able to focus consistently. You already have video creation/editing experience. Already done some AI influencers related jobs and have good experience in: Google VEO3, Nano Banana Pro, HeyGen, ElevenLabs, CapCut PRO and other similar tools. Your computer can handle multiple tabs open ( A LOT of them ). You care about doing things properly, understand and speak English well, respond to messages quickly, and can work up to 6 days per week. You’re a young, talented, smart individual. You’re okay with a slightly heavier learning phase in the first week, you’re not afraid to ask questions, you’re reliable and honest about mistakes, and you either already have or can get an iPhone device ( used only for specific verification codes - refunded if needed. You can even get some used iPhone 8 for like $40 which works ).\n\r\nWe value dedication, reliability, and improvement more than raw talent.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis job is not for you if\n\r\nYou’re looking for quick money, disappear without communication, can’t focus, you’re on the older side and have never edited 1 video in your life, never played with the AI tools mentioned above, your computer can’t handle having multiple tabs open at the same time, have unstable internet, refuse feedback, rush work carelessly, avoid consistency, or cannot communicate in English.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSalary & payments\n\r\nThis is a full-time position, starting at 6 days per week, under 10 hours per day. ( ultimately under 8h once you become very efficient, which our manager will help you achieve and it won't impact your salary working less - quite the opposite! )\n\r\n\n\r\nStarting salary ranges from around $440-$540/month based on experience, with the potential in the future to increase to $540+ based on a few factors such as performance, dedication, and quality of work.\n\r\n\n\r\nPayments are monthly, in any currency or method available in your country. ( we’ll try )\n\r\n\n\r\nTo build trust, we’re offering to pay you $100 after the first week of working with us, with the remaining balance at month end. ( we already got scammed by other platforms so please respect this )\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd remember, we pay $500+ dollars/month for paid tools so you can get them for FREE meaning your pay is actually 100% profit + refunds for any costs of yours. ( meaning in theory your total compensation is closer to $1000+ including tool access )\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHiring process (step-by-step)\n\r\n- Please re-read this job post carefully and only then submit your application.\n\r\n- In your job application, make sure to set the right title and answer every point.\n\r\n- We will review it and reach out with an extra message if accepted.\n\r\n- We'll send you a Google Form to fill out with contact info, etc.\n\r\n- You’ll be invited to our Discord server and will get your 1:1 chat.\n\r\n- You'll complete the training and take notes of it to learn everything.\n\r\n- We'll give you access to all the tools and refund any required purchases.\n\r\n- You'll officially start creating videos for Organic Media and get hired.\n\r\nSimple and effective.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy this is a real opportunity\n\r\nNo confusion, no guessing, no unpaid trials. You get real structured video training on Loom, real tools, real support, and real long-term growth - including potential promotion to coach or lead roles.\n\r\nSome jobs may offer to pay more, but very few:\n\r\nTeach you properly step by step, invest in you, respect your time, and give you paid tools for free.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply (pay attention)\n\r\nYour application title must start with the first word “ Influencer ”:\n\r\n“ Influencer: (…) “\n\r\nApplications without this will be ignored.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application, please include the following:\n\r\n- Your thoughts on the 5 videos linked above,\n\r\n- Your past experience ( or none - that’s fine ),\n\r\n- Links to any past work or simple edits,\n\r\n- a detailed introduction about yourself,\n\r\n- Your daily routine and availability,\n\r\n- Why you want this opportunity and why we should pick you over someone else. ( why you’re special )\n\r\n- and detailed answers to these 15 questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Do you have experience using CapCut on DESKTOP? How long have you been using it, and what type of videos do you usually create with it?\n\r\n2. Which AI video tools have you personally used? ( For example: VEO, Kling, Nano Banana Pro, Seedream 4,5, HeyGen, Vozo, etc.) Briefly describe what you used them for.\n\r\n3. When you watch short-form videos that reuse existing footage, are you able to recognize patterns such as hooks, pacing, avatar placement, and caption timing? Please explain how you notice these patterns.\n\r\n4. We work with very detailed step-by-step SOPs that specify exactly which clips to use and how to assemble them. How do you typically work when instructions are extremely clear and structured?\n\r\n5. If you are unsure about a task or something does not match the instructions, what do you do?\n\r\n6. When generating AI videos, what are the most common problems you run into? (for example: bad lip sync, weird hands, low realism, wrong lighting, artifacts, etc.)\n\r\n7. Would you say you’re more of a creative problem-solver who looks for shortcuts, loopholes, or ways around limitations, or someone who prefers to strictly follow rules and structure?\n\r\n8. Have you ever had to regenerate the same AI scene or just an image multiple times to get a usable result? What usually goes wrong and how do you fix it?\n\r\n9. When working with AI tools, do you prefer experimenting freely or strictly following a proven workflow? Why?\n\r\n10. Tell us about your PC specs, how much RAM and Available Storage and is it a PC or laptop/Macbook. Also, do you already have an iPhone/iPad? If so, which model is it/generation?\n\r\n11. Are you good at learning? Meaning if you want to learn something by for example, watching YouTube tutorials - do you usually rewatch it or take notes? Or just watch it once and try it yourself?\n\r\n12. Describe exactly how you usually organize your project files when working on multiple videos at the same time.\n\r\nFor example: how you name folders, how you separate drafts vs finals, and how you avoid losing assets.\n\r\n13. Take a look at the job post once again and find the 5 video example links we've included above. Watch all of them fully and let us know your overall thoughts, how do you think they were created - what tools would you use and why? Please cover the whole process in detail ( these aren't our videos but very similar )\n\r\n14. What are your long-term plans or goals with this opportunity?\n\r\n15. To confirm that you’ve read everything carefully, please tell us your favorite meal and dessert, as well as a restaurant in your country. Explain why someone from outside your country should absolutely try it. :)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not use ChatGPT or any AI to fully write your application. Be real, honest and detailed. We value spelling mistakes over perfect, AI generated responses. ( Yes, we can detect AI generated responses and it just isn't a good look on you )\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must also follow our Instagram: ( www.instagram.com/organicxmedia )\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nFinal note\n\r\nWe are hiring ONLY 1 PERSON for this role and are focused strictly on long-term relationships ( months + )\n\r\nIf you are dedicated, reliable, and willing to learn, this can be a very comfortable long-term position. Can’t wait to have you on - good luck!                ",

We are an accounting and tax firm based out of Phoenix, AZ (United States).\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a small, but growing company and are experiencing quite a bit of growth. This has pushed the need for us to hire you, our newest tea\nmber.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe help small businesses, just like ours, maintain, manage, and grow their businesses by ensuring accurate financials, processing payroll for their employees, tax preparation and strategy. We ensure we can take as much off the owner’s plate as possible while building trust within our working relationships.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re probably wondering if you would be our first Filipino tea\nmber?\n\r\n\n\r\nActually, no. We currently have 4 tea\nmbers who are from the Philippines like yourself. We have 2 bookkeeping specialists, a payroll specialist, and a tax specialist that are based in the Philippines as well. In addition to them, our operations manager is US based.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’re wondering what you would be doing?\n\r\n\n\r\nThe job title is Bookkeeping Specialist. I am looking for someone who can perform detailed bookkeeping for several small business clients. Your primary duties as a bookkeeper would include document processing, data entry, account reconciliation, ledger management, and financial report processing while understanding the business structure and needs. We are QuickBooks based, so a QuickBooks background is required. However, we will also train on processes.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, why should you join us over anyone and everyone else?\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you would like…\n\r\n1) a steady pay check with the chance for bonuses based on performance,\n\r\n2) the opportunity to work from home without a boss breathing down your neck,\n\r\n3) a team environment where you work with others to share the work, and\n\r\n4 ) if you want to work for a stable, growing U.S. firm,\n\r\n…then this is a job you will enjoy and excel at.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to know if you’re qualified for this opportunity?\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who has bookkeeping experience, complete understanding of debits and credits, assets and liabilities, inter-company transfers, problem solving skills, fluent in English speaking and writing with the experience of speaking directly with US clients, and most importantly someone who can work with little to no direction and meet deadlines. We do not expect you to know it all as we will train you in your position with everything you need to know about our clients and our field for you to be able to excel at your job.\n\r\n\n\r\nI do need you to be a good leader- someone who can effectively manage him or herself at the job as well as manage others; someone who has extensive attention to detail, can manage and meet deadlines, follow processes and provide ideas for enhanced processes, problem solve and troubleshoot on their own with little to no direction, be able to effectively resolve issues with upset clients. Intermediate bookkeeping/accounting experience, and QuickBooks experience is required.\n\r\n\n\r\nI also cannot teach you to have a good attitude and to be self-motivated. These are things you must demonstrate in the interview process.\n\r\n\n\r\nA successful applicant must be able to demonstrate:\n\r\n\n\r\n* A can do attitude, and the ability to work without constant supervision\n\r\n* Be able to speak in conversational English and write in passable English as well\n\r\n* Knowledge of Microsoft Office, Google Workspace, Dropbox, QuickBooks, and general ability to use windows based software\n\r\n* Have or be willing to obtain Internet fast enough to allow for virtual meeting such as zoom and VOIP phone calls without degradation\n\r\n* Working microphone and Internet video camera\n\r\n* Workstation with 2 monitors\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, what are the working hours?\n\r\n\n\r\nAs I stated before, our company is based in Phoenix, Arizona so we would require you to work during the US business hours, Monday to Friday 8:00am to 5:00pm Arizona Time\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about pay?\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are serious about hiring someone and are looking to fill this position ASAP. I also want this to be a real job that can meet your financial needs. Therefore, pay is negotiable but know I want you to be happy and satisfied working here, and a good pay scale is part of that.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about the 13th Month?\n\r\n\n\r\nWondering if we pay the 13th month? Unfortunately, we do not. However, we do offer other benefits such as pay time off, holiday pay, and sick time for Full-Time positions. These benefits begin to accrue after your 90 days probation period of a full-time position.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat happens next?\n\r\n\n\r\nSince our jobs are so popular we generally get deluged with applicants. So, I have designed a multi-part interview process to make the process as simple and efficient for all parties.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe first part of the interview process is designed to examine your English-speaking & writing skills, personality type, internet speed and ability to follow directions. Please realize the initial application process will take a time commitment on your part of roughly 10-20 minutes. Since this job is intended to be well paying, I hope this time commitment is acceptable to you. Please be advised that those who submit incomplete applications will be passed over.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you make it through this first round, we will talk via video chat to answer any questions you may have as well as get to know you better. If this goes well, I will invite you to meet some other tea\nmbers, as well as call your references to see if there is still a good fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will then ultimately hire someone.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nTherefore, to submit your application for the job, please complete all of the following and\n them to me at the reply to\n address: \n Please send me all the following to applications at resilientpros dot com\n\r\na.

Your job is to take the knowledge sitting inside our Leaders’ heads and turn it into simple, step-by-step processes that our staff can actually follow.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Leaders know exactly how things need to be done, but they don’t have the time to document every detail. You will build the playbook that keeps our operations consistent, scalable and easy to follow.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Do\n\r\n1. Process Detective (Extracting the Information)\n\r\nMeet with Team Leads across Operations, Scheduling, Cleaner Management, Finance and Sales.\n\r\nAsk them to walk you through how a task is done — you dig out the details.\n\r\nBreak big explanations into clear, small steps.\n\r\nIdentify missing pieces, unclear instructions or inconsistent approaches.\n\r\nSpot where staff are getting confused and help close those gaps.\n\r\n\n\r\n2.

Quality & Consistency Guardian\n\r\nEnsure all workflows follow best practice and support consistent delivery.\n\r\nKeep processes aligned across teams so everyone works the same way.\n\r\nMake sure we have the right documentation and audit trail when needed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are (Skills & Traits)\n\r\nLogical and organised — you think in steps.\n\r\nA simple, clear writer — no jargon, no fluff.\n\r\nConfident asking questions until you get the full picture.\n\r\nTech-comfortable — you can use tools to document processes and create flowcharts.\n\r\nCalm and steady — you focus on process, not people drama.\n\r\nYou enjoy turning chaos into structure and making things easy to follow.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow We Measure Success\n\r\nThe Maid My Day Playbook is complete, accurate and easy to follow.\n\r\nTeam Leads receive fewer “how do I do this?” messages from staff.\n\r\nStaff follow processes correctly without guesswork.\n\r\nYou turn Leaders’ knowledge into polished documents quickly and logically.\n\r\n\n\r\nNot a Fit If…\n\r\nYou expect others to write the processes for you.\n\r\nYou get overwhelmed by big-picture thinkers who jump around quickly.\n\r\nYou want to manage cleaners or run a team — this role is about systems.\n\r\nYou struggle to simplify information or create structure fro\nssy details.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this sounds like you, kindly send your resume to \n and please add 'Process, Systems & Training Specialist\" in the\n Subject line.
