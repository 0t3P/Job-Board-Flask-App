    "description": "\n                    Who We Are:\n\r\n - We are a focused product team building and evolving a suite of internal and customer-facing applications, including web admin tools, signage systems, and smart TV applications. Our work includes both new product development and ongoing improvements to existing production tools.\n\r\n - This is a part-time contract role starting at approximately 10 hours per week. Workload will vary based on active projects, and we want someone comfortable with that flexibility. If the relationship works well and work expands, there is potential for the role to grow over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role:\n\r\n - We are looking for a UI/UX Designer with strong Figma expertise who can take product requirements and translate them into clean, developer-ready designs — fast. This is a design execution role, not a brand strategy role. You will work within an existing design framework and system, producing screens, flows, and components that developers can build directly from.\n\r\n - Primary focus will be on Conqrse and AEO projects. You will take PRDs and convert them into usable UI so developers are never in the position of making layout decisions themselves.\n\r\n - This role is a part-time contract position with hours that will flex based on active project needs.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities:\n\r\n - Translate PRDs and wireframes into polished, developer-ready Figma files.\n\r\n - Work within the existing design system — extending it, not reinventing it.\n\r\n - Produce screens, flows, and component specs across desktop, tablet, and mobile as needed.\n\r\n - Build and maintain reusable components, variants, and patterns within Figma.\n\r\n - Document component states, usage guidelines, and design decisions clearly for engineers.\n\r\n - Iterate quickly on feedback from the PM and team leads.\n\r\n - Collaborate async with developers and PM using modern, AI-assisted workflows (Antigravity, MCP, etc.).\n\r\n - Participate in brief check-ins with overlap during U.S. hours.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Bring:\n\r\n - Strong Figma expertise — components, variants, auto-layout, styles, and tokens.\n\r\n - Experience building and maintaining reusable design systems for long-running products.\n\r\n - Ability to break down complex apps into consistent layouts, components, and patterns.\n\r\n - Good visual design sense: hierarchy, spacing, typography, color, and contrast.\n\r\n - Comfortable working from existing templates and systems rather than starting from scratch.\n\r\n - Understands responsive design and can design for desktop, tablet, and phone.\n\r\n\n\r\nCollaboration:\n\r\n - Comfortable working async with developers and PM, iterating quickly on feedback.\n\r\n - Able to document components, states, and usage clearly for engineers.\n\r\n - Comfortable collaborating with AI-assisted workflows and tools.\n\r\n - Good English communication skills.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Join Us:\n\r\n - Part-time contract starting at ~10 hours per week — flexible and project-driven.\n\r\n - Potential for the role to grow as projects and workload expand.\n\r\n - Ownership of real product screens used in live applications.\n\r\n - Small, supportive team where your work has direct impact.\n\r\n - Modern workflow using AI tools and current best practices.\n\r\n\n\r\nDesign Test:\n\r\nAll applicants will be given a short design test (~1 hour) as part of the hiring process. You will be provided with existing design elements and asked to build components and two views within Figma. This is not a test of creativity or brand vision — it is a test of your ability to work accurately and efficiently within an existing system.\n\r\n\n\r\nPortfolio Requirement:\n\r\nPlease include at least one example of a robust design system or multi-page web app built in Figma. We want to see how you organize files, structure components, and hand them off to developers.                ",

That you may later use for your own business? I'm very happy to help with any experiment of your own.\n\r\nMy win: You become an authentic face of the brand :) Super valuable for growing a community.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE APP (iPhone only)\n\r\nI realized that almost everyone would like to grow as a person, but no one REALLY knows how and where to start.\n\r\nHaving lots of experience in this area, I've built the first proper SYSTEM for personal development - so that literally anyone can start easily and doesn't need to buy an expensive Coach.\n\r\n-> \"Identity - Your Growth System\" in the App Store, just check it out, it's free. Early user feedback (250 users) has been insane! \n\r\n\n\r\nThe App structures this whole journey, gives lots of guidance and makes tracking super intuitive.\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR CONCRETE DELIVERABLES\n\r\n1 Reel per Day. \n\r\nWe iterate between low-effort reels, medium-effort, and high-effort.\n\r\nLow-Effort: Static shot, with single-statement on the screen\n\r\nMedium-Effort: Talking to the camera, sharing some learning/insight/struggle/tips\n\r\nHigh-Effort: \"Day in the Life\" type Reel\n\r\n-> I built a content engine that spits out a lot of ideas/messages, for the days where you don't have something natural to share\n\r\n\n\r\nWAYS OF WORKING\n\r\nNo micro-managing at all. We discuss the goals I have for the channel, and you have full creative freedom. I'm always available to assist with sparring ideas or removing blockers. We do a (paid) weekly feedback call, to discuss what is going good and what can be improved from both sides.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT I'M HOPING FOR\n\r\nThe only thing important for me is that you are an outgoing personality, and that you are really passionate about personal growth. Not necessarily that you're already an expert, but that you would LOVE to become one.\n\r\nSome examples:\n\r\n- reaching fitness goals (gym, calisthenics, pilates, yoga, core workouts, running, ..)\n\r\n- happiness and mindfulness (meditation, breathing, journaling, reducing doomscrolling, ..)\n\r\n- getting a better rhythm (sleeping times, waking times, evening routine, morning routine, ..)\n\r\n- better social life (meeting friends for coffee, organizing a dinner, calling friends/family, ..)\n\r\n- learning/curiosity (reading, podcasts, ..)\n\r\n- creativity (writing, painting, making music, ..)\n\r\n- purpose (side hustle, volunteering, ..)\n\r\n\n\r\nIF YOU HAVE READ UNTIL HERE\n\r\nYou're most likely a good candidate, otherwise you wouldn't have remained interested ;)\n\r\nBegin your application with \"LETS HAVE SOME FUN\", then a small text (2-5 sentences) explaining why you would love to get this job, and what makes you a good fit. End with \"I have an iPhone\" (you must be an iPhone user, because the App is iPhone-only).\n\r\nFeel free to attach any supporting material if you want.\n\r\n\n\r\nKICKOFF\n\r\nTwo paid trial weeks, for both of us to see whether it's a good fit :)                ",

    "description": "\n                    We are a small team specializing in wedding video editing. We create emotional highlight reels and are looking for someone with a good eye for \nnts and a feel for music.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe work is split into two separate paid tasks:\n\r\n\n\r\nShot Selection (Cuts): You will receive raw footage and a reference music track. Your task is to select the best shots and make rough cuts – essentially choosing the \nnts that tell the story. Payment for this stage: $17.50 per project.\n\r\n\n\r\nAssembly on Timeline: After the selection is approved, you will arrange those clips on the timeline perfectly synced to the beat of the music, add simple speed ramps or slow-motion where needed, and prepare the video for client review. Later, you will also implement any revision requests. Payment for this stage: $25.40 per project.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: Color grading and audio mixing are not required – we handle those separately.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho we are looking for:\n\r\nWe are primarily looking for beginners with no experience – we will train you. However, we are also open to candidates who already know DaVinci Resolve or Adobe Premiere Pro and have some editing experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nTraining plan:\n\r\nWe provide step-by-step training, starting with shot selection (understanding what makes a good wedding \nnt) and then moving to beat-synced assembly.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe first training project (shot selection only) is unpaid – it's a mutual test to see if you like the work and we like your style.\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter that, you will start with real projects and receive payment per stage as described above.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply:\n\r\nPlease fill out a short Google Form \n. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe will contact selected candidates via\n. You can find us by adding the phone number \n. \n\r\n\n\r\nResponse time: We reply within 24 hours (GMT+3, 5 hours behind Manila). Our working hours are 9 AM – 7 PM (2 PM – 12 AM Manila time).                ",

A guest wants to book for 1 night and whether quiet hours are strictly enforced. How do you respond?\n\r\n\n\r\n7. Occupancy is strong, but our pricing is lower than comparable properties nearby. What do you evaluate before adjusting pricing?\n\r\n\n\r\n8. Guest response times increased from 5 minutes to 45 minutes over the past two weeks. No one has complained yet. What do you do?\n\r\n\n\r\n9. Describe a system or workflow you built or improved in an property management operation. What was the problem and what changed after implementation?\n\r\n\n\r\n10. When do you escalate an issue to an owner instead of solving it yourself? Provide an example.\n\r\n\n\r\n11. What makes you stand out from other candidates applying for this role?\n\r\n\n\r\n12.

Even by American standards, our 7 cultural values are highly unusual. Our culture is challenging for people accustomed to corporate culture and especially difficult for people who grew up in Confucian cultures.

If you identify as a misfit, you'll do well.\n\r\nMultiple Software Systems - You're going to need to learn how to use 12 different software systems. This is great if you want to get exposed to and experience lots of technology, but it can be tough if you have a hard time learning technology.

Type in PINK ELEPHANT in all capital letters exactly as we've shown it here. \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCheat Code for getting a job with us:\n\r\n1) Our application comprises the majority of our recruiting process. Because of that, we suggest that you give us thoughtful responses and rich stories. We typically only interview applicants who give rich and detailed answers to our questions. If you write short responses so that you can hurry up and finish the application, you will not get interviewed. \n\r\n2) Tell us stories about how your actions match your beliefs and values. For example, if I say I value health and fitness, you don't know if I'm telling you the truth or if I'm just telling you what sounds good. But, if I tell you things I've done, I can illustrate my values of health and fitness with proof. For example, I go to the gym 4 days per week, I've done 6 triathlons, including an Ironman, and I can swim 3000 meters in one hour. My examples of things I've done prove that my actions match my values system. \n\r\n3) Be vulnerable and honest. We take very detailed notes during the interview process, and we conduct extensive background checks. If the stories you tell about yourself don't match what your references say, we will not hire you. We'd rather hire a C student who is honest about being a C student than someone who is a C student but tries to pass themselves off as an A student. Remember, this is an entry-level job. We're not looking for perfect. We're looking for an excellent cultural fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply: Please click on the link: \n                ",

Your mission is to bridge the gap between raw creative energy and algorithmic performance. You will be responsible for engineering virality, managing the high-stakes \"First Hour\" of every launch, and turning casual viewers into a loyal community. If you live for CTR spikes and retention graphs, this is your playground.\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Responsibilities\n\r\n1. Strategy & Growth\n\r\nPackaging Mastermind: Own the \"Big Three\"—Ideation, Titles, and Thumbnails. You will collaborate with the creative team to ensure every video has a \"lethal\" hook before a single frame is filmed.\n\r\n\n\r\nRetention Engineering: Audit scripts and rough cuts. You’ll identify \"boredom leaks\" and work with editors to ensure pacing keeps viewers glued to the screen.\n\r\n\n\r\nData-Driven Iteration: Conduct deep-dive audits of YouTube Analytics. You should be able to explain why a video underperformed and provide a concrete pivot strategy for the next one.\n\r\n\n\r\nA/B Testing: Constantly rotate and test titles/thumbnails using tools to squeeze every bit of potential out of the library.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Publishing & Technical Ops\n\r\nEnd-to-End Upload Management: Manage the entire \"Publishing Checklist\"—from raw file upload to final scheduling for peak audience activity.\n\r\n\n\r\nMetadata Optimization: Write SEO-rich descriptions, keyword-optimized tags, and accurate Chapter Markers (timestamps) to help the algorithm categorize our content.\n\r\n\n\r\nFeature Management: Execute \"The Handshake\"—optimizing End Screens and Info Cards to keep viewers on the channel, and setting up Pinned Comments to drive conversions.\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunity Engagement: Own the \"First Hour.\" You’ll be the voice of the channel, hearting and replying to top comments to signal high engagement to the algorithm.\n\r\n\n\r\nCopyright & Compliance: Ensure all uploads are ad-suitable and resolve any Content ID or copyright issues before the video goes public.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\nAlgorithm-Fluent: You understand CTR, AVD, and RPM like a second language.\n\r\n\n\r\nMeticulous & Detail-Oriented: You never miss a broken link in a description or a typo in a thumbnail. You treat every upload like a high-stakes launch.\n\r\n\n\r\nPsychology-Driven: You know how to leverage the \"curiosity gap\" without resorting to cheap clickbait.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe \"Truth-Teller\": You aren't afraid to tell the creative team that an idea \"won't work for the algorithm,\" even if it’s a high-production concept.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nProven Track Record: You have managed or grown a channel to [Insert Milestone, e.g., 100k+ subscribers] or have a portfolio of high-performing case studies.\n\r\n\n\r\nTool Kit: Proficient in YouTube Studio, [TubeBuddy/VidIQ], and Project Management software (Notion/Asana).\n\r\n\n\r\nVisual Literacy: You don't need to be a designer, but you must be able to direct designers to create world-class, high-CTR thumbnails.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nGeneric resumes will be ignored. To be considered, please send:\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Evidence: Links to 1–2 channels you’ve managed or helped grow, including one specific \"win\" you're proud of.\n\r\nThe Audit: One specific thing you would change about our current YouTube channel to improve performance.\n\r\nThe Checklist: List the 5 most important things you check in YouTube Studio before hitting \"Public.\"\n\r\nThe Favorite: Who is your favorite YouTuber right now, and what is one secret to their success?

    "description": "\n                    JOB DESCRIPTION:\n\r\nThis is not a typical EA role. We don’t need someone who takes notes and waits for instructions. We need a relentless, proactive operator who treats every hour of the executive’s time like capital deployed — if it doesn’t generate a return, it doesn’t make the schedule.\n\r\nYou will own the calendar. You will own the inbox. You will own the day. You will anticipate problems before they exist and eliminate bottlenecks before anyone notices them. You will protect the executive’s time ruthlessly and ensure every meeting, decision point, and commitment moves the business forward.\n\r\nIf you need to be told what to do twice, this isn’t for you. If you thrive on running the show behind the scenes and making things happen without being asked, keep reading.\n\r\nWhat You Will Own:\n\r\nSchedule & Calendar Management:\n\r\n ? Total ownership of the executive’s calendar — you d\n what gets time and what doesn’t\n\r\n ? Prioritise, schedule, reschedule, and decline meetings based on business impact, not politics\n\r\n ? Coordinate across multiple time zones with clients, contractors, project teams, and stakeholders across construction, mining, and energy sectors\n\r\n ? Build and enforce daily, weekly, and monthly routines that protect deep work time and maximise productivity\n\r\n ? Prepare daily briefing packs — what’s on, who’s attending, what decisions are needed, what background is required\n\r\n ? Anticipate scheduling conflicts and resolve them before they become problems\n\r\n & Communications Management:\n\r\n ? Manage and triage the executive’s inbox — filter, prioritise, flag, draft responses, and action items\n\r\n ? Draft correspondence, proposals, and communications on behalf of the executive in a professional, industry-appropriate tone\n\r\n ? Follow up on outstanding items relentlessly — nothing falls through the cracks on your watch\n\r\n ? Manage stakeholder communications with clients, contractors, government bodies, and internal teams\n\r\n ? Screen and manage phone calls, enquiries, and requests — gatekeep without creating friction\n\r\nTask & Project Coordination:\n\r\n ? Track and drive action items, deadlines, and commitments to completion — you are the accountability engine\n\r\n ? Coordinate with project teams, PMO, document controllers, and operational staff to ensure deliverables are on track\n\r\n ? Manage travel arrangements including flights, accommodation, visas, site access, and FIFO logistics for remote and international project sites\n\r\n ? Prepare and compile meeting agendas, minutes, and action registers — then chase every single action to closure\n\r\n ? Support tender coordination, client submissions, and business development activities as required\n\r\n ? Manage expense reports, purchase orders, and basic financial administration\n\r\nBusiness Operations Support:\n\r\n ? Maintain CRM entries, contact databases, and business development pipelines\n\r\n ? Prepare presentations, reports, and executive summaries for board meetings, client presentations, and internal reviews\n\r\n ? Conduct research on potential clients, projects, market opportunities, and competitors\n\r\n ? Manage confidential and sensitive information with absolute discretion\n\r\n ? Coordinate with legal, finance, HR, and compliance teams on behalf of the executive\n\r\n ? Identify and implement process improvements to streamline executive operations — if something is inefficient, fix it without being asked\n\r\nWhat We Expect:\n\r\n ? Minimum 5 years’ experience as an Executive Assistant, Chief of Staff, or similar high-accountability support role\n\r\n ? Direct experience supporting senior executives in construction, mining, energy, oil & gas, or heavy industrial sectors — you must understand the language, pace, and pressure of these industries\n\r\n ? Battle-tested calendar and inbox management — you’ve managed chaotic schedules across multiple time zones and made them run like clockwork\n\r\n ? Exceptional written and verbal English — your\ns, documents, and communications are indistinguishable from the executive’s own\n\r\n ? Advanced proficiency in Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Teams, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, SharePoint, OneDrive)\n\r\n ? Experience with project and task management tools (Asana, \n, Trello, ClickUp, or similar)\n\r\n ? Experience coordinating travel, logistics, and site mobilisations for remote and FIFO environments\n\r\n ? Relentless follow-through — you track every commitment and chase every action until it’s done\n\r\n ? Sound judgement and decision-making — you know when to act independently and when to escalate\n\r\n ? Thick skin, high standards, and zero tolerance for mediocrity — including your own\n\r\n ? Reliable high-speed internet and a professional home office setup with backup connectivity\n\r\nNon-Negotiables:\n\r\n ? You are proactive, not reactive — you anticipate, you don’t wait\n\r\n ? You are the gatekeeper — you protect time, you don’t waste it\n\r\n ? You are accountable — you own outcomes, not excuses\n\r\n ? You are discreet — you handle sensitive information without exception\n\r\n ? You are relentless — nothing slips, nothing is forgotten, nothing is late\n\r\nPreferred:\n\r\n ? Experience supporting C-suite or director-level executives in EPCM/EPC or owner-operator environments\n\r\n ? Familiarity with Aconex, SAP, Pronto, or other enterprise systems used in construction and mining\n\r\n ? Experience with Australian business practices, regulations, and corporate culture\n\r\n ? Exposure to business development, tendering, and client relationship management\n\r\n ? Experience managing multiple executives or small leadership teams simultaneously\n\r\nThis is a fully remote position. You must be available to align with Australian business hours or as otherwise directed. This role demands someone who operates with urgency, precision, and ownership every single day.
