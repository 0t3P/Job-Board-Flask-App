Even if there are many, you should apply. We are looking for the right person\n\r\n\n\r\nHello ????\n\r\nI run several small businesses and products and also consult for a few companies on product development and strategy. I previously founded, grew, and sold a software development agency: so there's a lot going on at any given time. I need someone to help me bring order to the chaos and execute on marketing tasks I know exactly how to do but don't have the time for.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPLEASE\n\r\nRead this job description carefully. You are much more likely to get this job if:\n\r\n1. You don't copy-paste some AI response to our questions\n\r\n2. You read carefully and provide everything we request\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n## What is the job about?\n\r\nThis is a hybrid Admin Assistant + Marketing Executor role. You'll support me across multiple businesses and projects with two types of work:\n\r\n\n\r\nAdmin & operations — the unglamorous but essential stuff: bookkeeping tasks, organizing documents, managing inboxes, preparing presentations, matching invoices to transactions, and keeping things from falling through the cracks.\n\r\n\n\r\nMarketing execution — following clear directions (and sometimes figuring things out yourself) to get marketing work done: scheduling social media posts, sourcing leads, researching influencers, preparing demos, creating AI-generated promo videos, reaching out to partners, and more.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou do NOT need to be a marketing expert. You need to be sharp, resourceful, and able to follow instructions well... while also having enough taste and initiative to move things forward without me micromanaging every step.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat will you be doing?\n\r\nIn no particular order:\n\r\n- Bookkeeping support — uploading invoices, matching bank transactions, reconciling spreadsheets\n\r\n- Lead research — using tools I'll provide to find and compile prospect lists based on criteria (company size, industry, location, etc.)\n\r\n- Influencer & partnership outreach — researching potential partners, reaching out according to templates we define together, managing relationships\n\r\n- Demo preparation — setting up product demos for leads/customers following given instructions\n\r\n- Content & social media — creating posting schedules, defining what gets posted when, using AI tools to generate promotional videos\n\r\n-\n/support inbox management — responding to questions, investigating user issues with internal tools, drafting responses for approval\n\r\n- GTM support — reaching out to targets for consulting initiatives, light negotiation, keeping me in the loop\n\r\n- Partner program management — keeping a webpage updated, onboarding new partners\n\r\n- A variety of other admin + marketing tasks — these will evolve as we go\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat does the engagement look like?\n\r\nThis is not a traditional role with a manual you follow every day. The tasks change daily. Some days are boring and repetitive. Other days are creative and strategic. You need to be comfortable with both.\n\r\nI'm juggling a lot and won't always have time for long briefings. You'll often get short instructions (or video walkthroughs) and need to run with them. Initiative matters enormously here.\n\r\n\n\r\n## How many hours? How does it progress?\n\r\nStarting at 100–120 hours/month (~25-30h/week). There is clear growth potential to full-time (160h/month) as we prove the fit and workload increases.\n\r\n\n\r\n## What are the requirements?\n\r\nStable internet connection\n\r\nAbility to do video calls\n\r\nFluent in English (written and spoken)\n\r\nAvailability must overlap at least 4–5 hours with Lisbon/Portugal time\n\r\nHighly organized and detail-oriented\n\r\nComfortable switching between very different tasks throughout the day\n\r\nResourceful — you Google things (or ChatGPT-them), you figure things out, you don't wait to be unblocked\n\r\nBasic comfort with spreadsheets,\n, and common online tools\n\r\nMarketing experience is a plus but not required\n\r\nBookkeeping/admin experience is a plus but not required\n\r\n\n\r\n## Why should you care?\n\r\nThis is an immense opportunity to learn and grow. You'll be exposed to multiple businesses, tools, marketing strategies, and AI products. For the right person — someone curious, proactive, and hungry to learn — this can be a career accelerator.\n\r\n\n\r\n## How to apply?\n\r\nSend your cover letter and introduction.\n\r\nYou MUST answer our screening questions or you will be immediately disqualified.\n\r\nYou MUST submit a introduction video or you will be immediately disqualified. Why? We need to see that you are proficient in English without back and forth.                ",

    "description": "\n                    We are a U.S.-based bookkeeping services company managing books for multiple clients across different industries. We need a senior bookkeeper who does not need to be managed.\n\r\nThat means you get assigned a client, you review their accounts, you understand their business, and you categorize their transactions correctly. On your own. The first time. If you need someone to tell you what each transaction means, this job is not for you.\n\r\nWe have two requirements that are not negotiable: integrity and independent judgment. In that order.\n\r\nWhat This Job Actually Is\n\r\nThis is not a follow-the-instructions role. You will be given client accounts and expected to own them. That means:\n\r\nReviewing a client's chart of accounts and transaction history and understanding it without being coached\n\r\nCategorizing transactions correctly based on the type of business they run\n\r\nSpotting anything unusual, ambiguous, or wrong and flagging it before it becomes a problem\n\r\nKnowing that a medical practice and a construction company have different books and applying that knowledge\n\r\nCommunicating problems early, not after the fact\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are the type who waits to be told what to do, please do not apply. If you are the type who figures it out and escalates only the genuinely unclear stuff, we want to talk to you.\n\r\nDay to Day Responsibilities\n\r\nTransaction categorization across multiple client accounts, independently\n\r\nBank and credit card reconciliations\n\r\nAccounts payable and accounts receivable\n\r\nPayroll entry from Gusto payroll reports into QBO\n\r\nRecording Stripe and other payment processor transactions, including fee handling\n\r\nFinancial reporting support\n\r\nSending templated client requests such as asking for bank statements. No freeform client communication.\n\r\nLight VA work including entering financial data into Excel or Fathom for KPI reporting, and occasional website posting\n\r\n\n\r\nSoftware\n\r\nRequired:\n\r\nQuickBooks Online (QBO), must be proficient\n\r\nXero, must be proficient\n\r\nMicrosoft Excel or Google Sheets\n\r\n\n\r\nPreferred, training available if needed:\n\r\nDouble, formerly known as Keeper, for transaction review and categorization\n\r\nFathom for KPI reporting\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Are Looking For\n\r\nEducation:\n\r\nBS Accountancy degree required. CPA preferred but not required.\n\r\nSolid working knowledge of U.S. accounting standards and practices\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience:\n\r\nAt least 3 years managing books for multiple U.S.-based clients at the same time\n\r\nProven ability to onboard a new client account without hand-holding\n\r\nExperience across different business types and industries\n\r\n\n\r\nWho you are:\n\r\nHonest. You flag mistakes, including your own. You do not hide them.\n\r\nSelf-directed. You take ownership of your accounts.\n\r\nProactive. You raise issues before they become problems.\n\r\nAvailable to overlap with U.S. Central Standard Time business hours\n\r\nStrong written English\n\r\n\n\r\nPay and Benefits\n\r\n$5.00 USD per hour, full-time at 40 hours per week, with CST overlap required.\n\r\n\n\r\nBenefits include:\n\r\n13th month pay\n\r\nPaid Philippine public holidays\n\r\nPaid trial period before full onboarding\n\r\n\n\r\nWe start every new hire with a paid trial period of 2 to 3 weeks on a single client account. It lets both sides confirm the fit before full onboarding. We are looking for someone long-term, not a short engagement.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nRead every word of this section. Following instructions is part of the job.\n\r\nPhase 1: Written Application\n\r\nApply through OnlineJobs.ph and include:\n\r\nYour resume or work history with specific bookkeeping experience and the industries you have worked in\n\r\nYour education and any accounting certifications\n\r\nA short paragraph about why integrity matters to you in a bookkeeping role\n\r\nWritten answers to all four screening questions below\n\r\n\n\r\nScreening Questions:\n\r\nQuestion 1: You are assigned a new client who runs a physical therapy practice. You have their chart of accounts and three months of uncategorized transactions. Walk us through how you approach it. What do you look at first? How do you determine the right categories? And what do you do when a transaction is unclear?\n\r\nQuestion 2: How do you record a Stripe payout in QuickBooks Online? Walk us through how you handle Stripe fees and the difference between the gross payout and the amount that actually hits the bank account.\n\r\nQuestion 3: A client's Gusto payroll report shows gross wages of $4,200, employer taxes of $380, and net pay of $3,820. Walk us through every account you would use in QBO and how you confirm the net pay matches the bank withdrawal.\n\r\nQuestion 4: Tell us about a time you caught a bookkeeping error, yours or someone else's. What was the error, what did you do, and what happened?\n\r\nOne more thing: somewhere in the middle of your application, include the word Tangerine exactly once in your subject line. Applications without it will not be reviewed.\n\r\nPhase 2: Video Response\n\r\nIf your written application stands out, we will send you a client scenario and ask for a short Loom video, 2 to 3 minutes, walking through your answer. No preparation needed. This just confirms that what you wrote is what you actually know.\n\r\nPhase 3: Live Interview\n\r\nFinalists will have a short live video call with follow-up questions based on their earlier answers. It is a conversation, not a test. We want to make sure this works for both of us.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run a professional operation, and we take the quality of our work seriously. If you are an accountant who owns their accounts, catches problems early, and does not need to be managed, we would like to hear from you.\n\r\nWe look forward to your application.                ",

You are the person who keeps communication, scheduling, and small ops decisions moving without drama, guesswork, or missed details.\n\r\nIf you love clear rules, organized systems, and making a busy operator’s life easier, this is for you.\n\r\nCompensation & Hours\n\r\nRate: Competitive, based on experience and location\n\r\nHours: 10–25 hours/week to start, with potential to increase as the role expands\n\r\nSchedule: You choose a consistent 3–4 hour window within 9am–5pm Pacific, Monday–Friday\n\r\nGrowth path: Start with Phase 1 (inbox + calendar). As you master it, we’ll expand into more operations and potentially increase hours and rate.\n\r\nWhen you apply, include your desired hourly rate in USD and target weekly hours.\n\r\nAbout This Role\n\r\nThis position was previously held by someone who helped the business through its early, more informal stage but preferred more autonomy as we shifted to systems?driven growth. We’re now looking for someone who thrives in structure, SOPs, and checklists and wants to be in this type of role for years, not months.\n\r\nOutcomes (What You’re Measured On)\n\r\nInbox zero in the main business inbox every workday, with correct tagging and escalation.\n\r\nClean, reliable calendar that protects deep work and client time.\n\r\nSOP execution: You read, follow, and improve written processes without needing things repeated.\n\r\nOn?time logistics: Travel, calls, and events are booked and confirmed without last?minute surprises.\n\r\nResponsibilities\n\r\nPhase 1 (First 30 Days): Inbox & Calendar\n\r\nOwn the main inbox:\n\r\nTriage, reply, or route\ns using clear rules (Urgent, To Respond, Waiting On, Financial, etc.).\n\r\nApply the 72?hour “urgent” rule (anything affecting money, clients, or reputation in the next and previous 72 hours).\n\r\nSummarize\ns and provide next action\n\r\nDraft and send replies from templates and SOPs.\n\r\nEscalate urgent items in chat using a simple template:\n\r\nWho it’s from, when it matters, summary, what happens if we ignore it, what decision you need from Zac, and your recommendation.\n\r\nManage Zac’s calendar within constraints:\n\r\nProtect focus blocks and client blocks.\n\r\nBook/reschedule calls with correct Zoom links and time zones.\n\r\nAdd buffers and color coding per SOP.\n\r\nPhase 2 (After ~30–60 Days): Ops & Logistics\n\r\nBook and manage travel (flights, hotels, cars) inside written price and airline rules (“Keep It 100,” notify on bigger changes, etc.).\n\r\nCoordinate logistics for in?person seminars (printing manuals/waivers, scanning, shipping small items).\n\r\nLight phone work: confirming or rescheduling appointments using scripts.\n\r\nLoad/schedule\ns and simple content (Mailerlite, social schedulers) from a pre?built content calendar and copy provided by the team.\n\r\nPhase 3 (Optional, After Mastery): Light Lead Management\n\r\nMonitor high?intent inquiries and forms.\n\r\nUse a simple decision tree to route people to the right next step (coach call, waitlist, free resource) with scripted replies.\n\r\nYou do not create offers or pricing; you execute the existing playbook.\n\r\nTrial Period (First 30 Days)\n\r\nThis starts as a paid 30?day trial focused on Phase 1 (inbox + calendar).\n\r\nTo continue past 30 days, you must consistently:\n\r\nMaintain inbox zero on 90%+ of workdays.\n\r\nCorrectly identify and escalate urgent\ns using the 72?hour rule at least 90% of the time.\n\r\nKeep the calendar clean: zero double?bookings, time?zone errors, or broken Zoom links.\n\r\nFollow all Phase 1 SOPs without needing to be reminded.\n\r\nIf you hit these, we move into Phase 2 and discuss hours / rate at 90 days. If you don’t, we part ways professionally.\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nExcellent written and spoken English.\n\r\nStrong attention to detail and follow?through.\n\r\nComfortable working from detailed SOPs and checklists.\n\r\nTech?savvy with\n, calendars, Zoom, cloud storage, and basic spreadsheets.\n\r\nWilling to use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Loom, etc.) as force multipliers.\n\r\nStable internet and ability to check in daily during agreed hours.\n\r\nAvailable for a consistent 3–4 hour block within 9am–5pm Pacific, Monday–Friday.\n\r\nNice to Have (Not Required)\n\r\nExperience supporting online coaches, creators, or small education businesses.\n\r\nPrior experience as an EA/VA or operations assistant.\n\r\nYou’ll Thrive Here If…\n\r\nYou love structure and systems (not just tolerate them).\n\r\nYour first question is, “What’s the SOP?” not “What do you want me to do?”\n\r\nFeedback feels like coaching, not criticism.\n\r\nYou’d rather have 10 clear rules than vague “figure it out” autonomy.\n\r\nYou’re comfortable saying, “I don’t know yet, but here’s how I’d find out.”\n\r\nYou default to over?communication: flag early, confirm often.\n\r\nThis Is Not For You If…\n\r\nYou prefer loose guidelines over detailed checklists.\n\r\nYou feel micromanaged when work is spot?checked.\n\r\nYou’re “more of a big?picture person” (this role is the details).\n\r\nYou’re juggling 3+ other clients and can’t give this role consistent focus.\n\r\nYou’re looking for a short?term stepping stone, not a multi?year seat.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply (Read Carefully) - Upwork and PH\n\r\nStart with this exact line: VA Application – Keep It 100\n\r\nIn the very next line, answer in one sentence:\n\r\n\n\r\n According to our SOPs, what should you do if an expense is $100 or less?\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nBelow that, include:\n\r\n3–5 bullet points of your most relevant experience.\n\r\nYour typical working hours and time zone.\n\r\nYour desired hourly rate in USD and target weekly hours.\n\r\nA short note (5–8 sentences) on why this role fits you long?term.\n\r\nAt the very end of your proposal, include these two sentences exactly:\n\r\n\n\r\n I understand this role requires daily inbox zero and spot?checks on my work for the first 90 days. I’m comfortable with both.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that do not follow these steps will not be considered.                ",

Our products—including the Hardwire gaming earbuds and SANWEAR-GT wireless earbuds—are built for gamers who demand exceptional audio quality and comfort. We’re a lean, fast-moving team that punches well above its weight.\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nWe’re looking for a Customer Experience Manager to take full, end-to-end ownership of customer support at SAN Sound. This is not a ticket-answering role—this is a department-building role. You will be the first dedicated hire in this function and will be responsible for architecting, executing, and scaling our entire customer experience operation from the ground up.\n\r\nIn the early days, you’ll be hands-on—handling all inbound customer inquiries, building AI-powered response systems, creating templates, and establishing the processes and data infrastructure that will allow us to scale. As the business grows, you’ll hire and manage a team beneath you. You’ll work closely with our AI system developers and communications team (copywriting and product tech) to build intelligent, seamless support across\n, website, and potentially voice channels.\n\r\nThe right person for this role has built a CS department before, thinks strategically about customer experience as a competitive advantage, and is energized by the challenge of building infrastructure that can handle 10x growth.\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\nDepartment Strategy & Build-Out\n\r\n• Own the full customer experience function from day one—strategy, execution, and continuous improvement\n\r\n• Design and implement the CS department architecture working with our developers: workflows, escalation paths, SLAs, and KPIs\n\r\n• Develop a scalable support model leveraging AI-first principles with human oversight\n\r\n• Propose and get approval for builds, tooling, and team expansion from the COO\n\r\n• Create a roadmap to move from one-person operation to a fully staffed, scalable department\n\r\nAI-Powered Support Operations\n\r\n• Collaborate with AI system developers to architect and optimize automated\n responses, website AI chat support, and future AI voice/call support\n\r\n• Work with the communications team (copywriting and product tech) to ensure AI responses reflect brand voice, product accuracy, and customer empathy\n\r\n• Build, maintain, and continuously refine response templates and AI training data\n\r\n• Monitor AI performance and identify gaps where human intervention improves outcomes\n\r\nHands-On Customer Support\n\r\n• Handle all customer inquiries across channels during the initial build phase\n\r\n• Monitor and respond to customer issues via Zendesk,\n, and Shopify\n\r\n• Ensure timely, high-quality resolutions that reflect SAN Sound’s premium brand standards\n\r\n• Manage returns, exchanges, warranty claims, and order-related issues\n\r\nData, Reporting & Continuous Improvement\n\r\n• Build and maintain a data tracking and reporting framework for CS operations\n\r\n• Record, analyze, and report on customer inquiries, resolution times, satisfaction scores, and recurring issues\n\r\n• Use data insights to drive improvements in AI responses, templates, processes, and product feedback loops\n\r\n• Provide regular performance reports and strategic recommendations to the COO\n\r\nSocial Media Comment Support\n\r\n• Monitor and respond to customer queries, comments, and feedback across SAN Sound’s social media channels\n\r\n• Ensure timely, on-brand responses to product questions, support issues, and general engagement on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and\n\r\n• Triage and escalate complex issues from social media to the appropriate internal teams or support channels\n\r\n• Collaborate with the Social Media Manager to maintain a consistent, helpful brand voice in public-facing interactions\n\r\nCommunity Management (Secondary)\n\r\n• Monitor SAN Sound’s \n community for customer issues, product feedback, and engagement opportunities\n\r\n• Provide a consistent, helpful brand presence in community channels\n\r\n• Escalate community-surfaced issues to the appropriate internal teams\n\r\n• Note: This responsibility is secondary to core CS operations and assumes AI is handling the heavy lifting on support volume\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n• 4+ years of experience managing customer service end-to-end, with demonstrated experience building out a CS department or function from scratch\n\r\n• Strong understanding of ecommerce customer experience for DTC brands; gaming or audio industry experience is a significant plus\n\r\n• Proficiency with Zendesk (required), Shopify, and modern CS tooling\n\r\n• Comfort working with AI tools and a forward-thinking mindset on AI’s role in customer support—you don’t need to build AI systems, but you need to drive buildouts alongside developers\n\r\n• Fluent in English (written and verbal)—communication clarity is essential even when leveraging AI\n\r\n• Experience with ClickUp, Google Workspace (GSuite), and \n\r\n• Highly organized, self-motivated, and capable of working autonomously in a remote, distributed team environment\n\r\n• Strong analytical skills—comfortable building reporting frameworks and using data to drive decisions\n\r\n• Excellent judgment on when to escalate, when to act independently, and when to propose new initiatives\n\r\nNice to Have\n\r\n• Experience in gaming, esports, or audio/consumer electronics industries\n\r\n• Experience with AI chatbot implementation or conversational AI platforms\n\r\n• Background in community management or building brand communities\n\r\n• Familiarity with international ecommerce operations and cross-border customer support\n\r\nWhy SAN Sound?\n\r\n• Build from scratch: You’ll own and shape an entire department—not inherit someone else’s system\n\r\n• AI-forward culture: We embrace AI as a force multiplier, not a threat—you’ll be at the forefront of how support is evolving\n\r\n• Growth trajectory: We’re scaling aggressively across Asian markets with strong funding and ambitious targets\n\r\n• Premium brand: Work with products that people genuinely love in a passionate gaming community\n\r\n• Lean team, real impact: Your work directly shapes the customer experience and the company’s growth\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nSend your resume along with a cover letter on your experience building CS operations and how you’d approach building an AI-powered support department from scratch.
