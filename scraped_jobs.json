Do not use random clips.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have provided a library of over 190 assets in the B-roll folder.

We professionally deploy, harden, and maintain OpenClaw instances for global executives, founders, and small teams (4–50 employees) who want the power of a personal AI agent without the security nightmare of doing it themselves.\n\r\n\n\r\nThink of us as the SetupClaw model ($1,560–$3,120 per implementation + $2,450–$9,750/mo managed care) but purpose-built for remote/international clients and digital-first executives who don't have a Mac mini sitting in their SF office. Our founder brings 20+ years of Fortune 500 operations and project management experience from Amazon.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role Exists\n\r\n\n\r\nOpenClaw is incredibly powerful — and incredibly dangerous in the wrong hands. Here's what the security landscape looks like as of February 2026:\n\r\n\n\r\n- 512 vulnerabilities found in a January 2026 security audit, 8 classified as critical\n\r\n- CVE\n(CVSS 8.8): 1-click remote code execution via malicious webpage — could steal API keys, tokens, and execute arbitrary commands\n\r\n- 30,000+ exposed instances found publicly accessible with zero authentication (Bitsight, Jan–Feb 2026)\n\r\n- 800+ malicious skills on ClawHub, including compromised GitHub accounts auto-deploying malware every few minutes (Bitdefender)\n\r\n- Cisco flagged OpenClaw as \"Exhibit A in How Not To Do AI Security\" — citing data exfiltration, prompt injection, and malicious skill execution\n\r\n- Palo Alto Networks called it \"the potential biggest insider threat of 2026\"\n\r\n- Commodity infostealers (RedLine, Lumma, Vidar) are actively targeting OpenClaw installations\n\r\n- No bug bounty program or dedicated security team exists within the OpenClaw project itself\n\r\n- OpenClaw's own maintainer, Shadow, warned on \n: \"If you can't understand how to run a command line, this is far too dangerous of a project for you to use safely.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is exactly why our clients will pay premium prices for professional deployment. We need someone who can make OpenClaw safe, not just functional.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Do\n\r\n\n\r\nSecurity Hardening (Primary Responsibility)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Follow and extend the official OpenClaw hardening guide for every client deployment: loopback-only binding, no public endpoints, sandboxing, credential isolation\n\r\n- Vet all skills/plugins before installation — no unaudited third-party code touches client machines\n\r\n- Configure network security: firewall rules, port management (18789/18793), WebSocket origin validation\n\r\n- Manage credential lifecycle: API keys in env vars (never in prompts), credential rotation post-deployment, log redaction\n\r\n- Implement prompt injection defenses and monitor for data exfiltration attempts\n\r\n- Track CVEs and security advisories — apply patches within 24–48 hours of disclosure\n\r\n- Run security audits before every client handoff and document findings\n\r\n\n\r\nClient Deployment & Maintenance\n\r\n\n\r\n- Deploy OpenClaw on client hardware or VPS (Mac mini, DigitalOcean, or equivalent) via remote sessions\n\r\n- Configure integrations: Gmail, Google Calendar, Outlook, Slack, WhatsApp,\n, Notion, HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.\n\r\n- Build mission-critical workflows per client needs (inbox triage, calendar management, draft replies, CRM updates)\n\r\n- Provide 14-day hypercare post-deployment and ongoing managed care support\n\r\n- Create deployment documentation and security checklists for each client\n\r\n\n\r\nProcess & Playbook Development\n\r\n\n\r\n- Help build our repeatable deployment playbook so we can scale to licensed operators in other markets\n\r\n- Create a security compliance framework that helps clients pass InfoSec/CISO review\n\r\n- Stay current with the OpenClaw open-source community, GitHub releases, and emerging attack vectors\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Skills & Experience\n\r\n\n\r\n- Hands-on OpenClaw experience — you've personally deployed, hardened, and maintained at least one instance\n\r\n- Linux/macOS system administration — comfortable with Node.js services, port management, firewall rules, SSH, and process isolation\n\r\n- Security fundamentals — understanding of WebSocket security, CORS, prompt injection, credential management, and supply chain attacks\n\r\n- VPS deployment experience — DigitalOcean, AWS, Hetzner, or similar (our clients are remote-first, not in-person)\n\r\n- API/integration knowledge — experience with OAuth, API keys, messaging platform APIs (Slack,\n, WhatsApp)\n\r\n- Strong written communication — you'll write security documentation and interface with executive-level clients\n\r\n- Reliable remote work habits — we operate across time zones; async communication via Slack is essential\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have\n\r\n\n\r\n- Active contributor to the OpenClaw GitHub repository or community\n\r\n- Experience with AI agent security (prompt injection research, LLM safety, agentic system risks)\n\r\n- Familiarity with the Cisco, Bitdefender, Kaspersky, or Trend Micro security assessments of OpenClaw\n\r\n- Experience building SOPs or deployment playbooks for technical services\n\r\n- Background in managed IT services or MSP operations\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Structure\n\r\n\n\r\n- Engagement: Contract (1099 / international contractor)\n\r\n- Rate: $50–$100/hr depending on experience (open to project-based pricing per deployment)\n\r\n- Hours: 10–20 hrs/week initially, scaling with client volume\n\r\n- Location: Fully remote — anywhere in the world\n\r\n- Growth: Revenue share or equity discussion for the right long-term partner\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nSend a short message (no cover letter needed) with:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Your OpenClaw experience — what have you deployed, how did you harden it, what went wrong?\n\r\n2. One security risk most OpenClaw users don't know about (show us you actually understand the threat landscape)\n\r\n3. Your hourly rate and timezone\n\r\n4. Link to any relevant work — GitHub, blog posts, security write-ups, OpenClaw community contributions\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy security is non-negotiable for us:\n\r\n\n\r\nOur clients are CEOs, CFOs, and Heads of Sales connecting their most sensitive accounts —\n, calendar, CRM, messaging — to an AI agent with full system access. A single misconfiguration could leak API keys, expose client communications, or enable remote code execution. We charge premium prices because we guarantee this doesn't happen. If security isn't your first instinct, this isn't the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nClawNomad — Secure AI Agents, Deployed Anywhere                ",

We are looking for a Systems Operator to manage the pipeline from AI generation to final publication. This is a role for a disciplined executor who thrives on SOPs, checklists, and zero-error tolerances.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role (Responsibilities)\n\r\nProduction: Operating AI generation suites based on Founder-provided Titles/Angles.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompliance: Managing dedicated Chrome profiles and proxies with 100% isolation (No cross-contamination).\n\r\n\n\r\nPublishing: Executing bulk uploads, applying metadata templates, and optimizing monetization (Mid-rolls).\n\r\n\n\r\nReporting: Maintaining the \"Control Tower\" (Tracking Sheet) in real-time.\n\r\n\n\r\nMandatory Technical Requirements:\n\r\n\n\r\nProxy Discipline: Experience using proxies and anti-detect browsers\n\r\n\n\r\nTooling: Familiarity with Gemini, Canva, Slack, Asana/Notion/Clickup/Trello\n\r\n\n\r\nConnectivity: High-speed internet with 99% uptime.\n\r\n\n\r\n????

If you try to change my titles or \"improve\" the scripts without permission, you will be terminated immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are \"Multitasking\": If you plan on managing 5 other clients while running my pipeline, you will fail. We track upload timestamps and proxy logs.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou Lack Attention to Detail: If you cannot distinguish between \"Channel_A\" and \"Channel_B\" file structures, you are a liability to the network.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou Don't Know Proxies: If you have ever logged into two different YouTube channels on the same standard browser window, you are not qualified for this role.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply (The \"Dumb Requirement\" Test)\n\r\nTo prove you can follow an SOP to the letter, your application must include:\n\r\n\n\r\nThe subject line: \"Systems Operator – [Your Name] – Zero Error Goal\"\n\r\n\n\r\nA screenshot of your current internet speed test.\n\r\n\n\r\nA 2-sentence explanation of why Channel Isolation is critical for a YouTube network.\n\r\n\n\r\nType the word \"ACTUATOR\" at the very bottom of your message so I know you read the entire post.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that fail to follow these 4 steps will be deleted without review.

We need a video editor who can take a script + voiceover audio and turn it into a polished, visually compelling documentary — using AI tools to generate the visuals.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is *not* a slideshow job. We're looking for someone who understands pacing, visual storytelling, and how to make AI-generated scenes feel cinematic and cohesive.\n\r\n\n\r\n## What You'll Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\n- Receive a **script + voiceover audio** for each video\n\r\n- Generate **AI video clips** (95%+ of the video) and occasional AI images that match the narration, using tools like Freepik, Higgsfield, or similar (we will provide the access)\n\r\n- The vast majority of the video must be **animated clips, not static images**. Still images are acceptable only briefly and sparingly\n\r\n- Edit everything together into a finished documentary-style video (20–45 minutes)\n\r\n- Add captions, transitions, and ensure tight audio-visual sync\n\r\n- Deliver one video per day (average)\n\r\n\n\r\n## What We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Strong video editing skills** — CapCut, DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, or similar\n\r\n- **Experience with AI image/video generation** — You've actually used tools like Freepik, Higgsfield, Midjourney, Runway, Kling, or similar. This is a must.\n\r\n- **Understanding of documentary pacing** — You know how to let scenes breathe, build tension, and match visuals to narration\n\r\n- **Visual storytelling sense** — The images and clips you choose/generate should reflect what's being said, not just be \"cool looking\"\n\r\n- **Consistency** — Characters, settings, lighting, and style should feel cohesive across the full video\n\r\n- **Autonomous and resourceful** — You'll have the script and audio. You should be able to figure out what visuals to create without waiting for detailed instructions on every scene\n\r\n- **Responsive communicator** — You'll join our Slack. We expect timely responses, especially during the onboarding period\n\r\n- **Strong English** — Written communication must be clear and fluent\n\r\n\n\r\n## What We Provide\n\r\n- Script + voiceover audio for each video\n\r\n- Reference channels and style guidelines\n\r\n- Over time: AI-generated prompts and visual directions to speed up your workflow (but you should NOT depend on these — they're a productivity tool, not a replacement for your judgment)\n\r\n\n\r\n## Compensation\n\r\n- **$20–$25 per video** depending on experience and quality\n\r\n- **Volume:** ~1 video per day = consistent, daily work\n\r\n- **Long-term:** We're building a team. If you're the right fit, this is ongoing work, not a one-off gig.\n\r\n\n\r\n## Reference Channels\n\r\nWatch these to understand the style and quality we're aiming for:\n\r\n1. **Tim - Reborn History** — [The Industrial Revolution in the 1700s](\n)\n\r\n2. **Restored Timeline** — [What New York Looked Like in 1660](\n)\n\r\n3. **Worlds Before Us** — [What It Took to Survive Europe's Great Famine](\n)\n\r\n\n\r\nPay attention to:\n\r\n- How visuals sync with narration\n\r\n- Pacing and transitions\n\r\n- Visual consistency across scenes\n\r\n- How AI-generated content is used to tell a story, not just fill screen time\n\r\n\n\r\n## How to Apply — REQUIRED TEST\n\r\n**Do not apply without completing this test.** We will not review applications without a sample video.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe've prepared a short test to see how you work:\n\r\n1. **Download the test materials here:** \n\r\nDownload the script: \n\r\nDownload the audio: \n\r\n2. Read the SOP/Brief here: \n\r\n3. **Create a 1–2 minute sample video** using the script excerpt and audio we provide\n\r\n4. Use **any AI tools available to you** (free or paid — we're not judging resolution)\n\r\n5. **Submit your sample video** with your application\n\r\n\n\r\n### What we're evaluating (NOT evaluating resolution or tool quality):\n\r\n- ? Majority of scenes are clips/animations (like the referred channels)\n\r\n- ? Does the visual content match what the narration is saying?\n\r\n- ? Is the pacing natural and engaging — not too fast, not too slow?\n\r\n- ? Are transitions smooth and intentional?\n\r\n- ? Does it feel like a documentary, not a slideshow?\n\r\n- ? Is there visual consistency (style, lighting, mood)?\n\r\n- ? Did you follow the brief?\n\r\n\n\r\n### What we're NOT evaluating:\n\r\n- ? Resolution (720p or less from a free tool is fine)\n\r\n- ? Which specific AI tool you used\n\r\n- ? Hollywood-level production value\n\r\n- ? How long took you to do it\n\r\n\n\r\n**This test exists because we need to see YOUR work, not downloaded samples.**\n\r\n\n\r\n## To Apply\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Complete the test sample video\n\r\n2. Send your application with:\n\r\n   - Your sample video (link or file)\n\r\n   - Brief description of which AI tools you used\n\r\n   - Your relevant experience (keep it short)\n\r\n   - Your availability                ",

If you deliver qualified calls at a strong cost-per-lead, this becomes a long-term relationship.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nSend a message that includes:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. 2–3 examples of local service Google Ads campaigns you've managed, with real metrics (cost-per-lead, call volume, conversion rates)\n\r\n2. One specific thing you'd change about our Google Ads approach after looking at \n\r\n3. Your proposed pricing for the audit (Phase 1) and monthly management (Phase 3)\n\r\n4. Your current Google Ads certification status\n\r\n\n\r\nBottom line: This is a lead gen business where every ad dollar needs to produce a phone call from someone stranded on the side of the road with a diesel truck that won't start. If you know how to make Google Ads ring phones for local service businesses, we want to talk to you.                ",

    "description": "\n                    About ElasticIT \n\r\n\n\r\nAt ElasticIT, we're building a world where healthcare workers never wait for technology. We're not just another IT support company, we're the team that rescues healthcare providers when technology threatens patient care, turning chaos into clarity and making ordinary teams extraordinary through the right technology. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe specialize in healthcare IT, providing managed services, custom software development, and HIPAA-compliant solutions that ensure medical professionals can focus on what matters most: their patients, not their systems. Our North Star is audacious yet simple: by 2050, we will eliminate repetitive IT tasks for 1 million healthcare workers, proving that the right technology makes ordinary people extraordinary. \n\r\n\n\r\nOur Values: The DNA of How We Operate \n\r\n\n\r\nOur values aren't just words on a wall, they're the blueprint for every interaction, every solution, and every relationship we build: \n\r\n\n\r\nOur Core Values \n\r\n\n\r\nSIMPLIFY THE OVERWHELMING: Cut through confusion with clarity and convert half-hour tasks into one-click wins \n\r\n\n\r\nRESCUE WHEN OTHERS PANIC: Respond when others would panic and deliver the impossible under pressure \n\r\n\n\r\nBUILD LASTING CAPABILITY: Create tools that spread like wildfire and teams that work without micromanaging \n\r\n\n\r\nPERSIST THROUGH CHAOS: Adapt when goalposts keep moving and turn disasters into relationships \n\r\n\n\r\nENABLE HUMAN PURPOSE: Remove barriers so the focus can be on patients, not systems \n\r\n\n\r\n \n\r\nThe Role \n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll be the person who sees what others miss, the patterns in the chaos, the root causes beneath the symptoms, the opportunities hidden in problems. When three different practices call with \"emergencies\" simultaneously, you'll instinctively know which is truly critical and which can wait. You'll spot the recurring issue that everyone else treats as isolated i\n. \n\r\n\n\r\nMore importantly, you'll be the person who makes everyone around you better. Not through commanding or controlling, but by asking the right questions that help technicians find their own answers. By providing just enough support to build confidence without creating dependence. By recognizing potential in tea\nmbers before they see it in themselves. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't about theoretical leadership or rigid hierarchies, it's about having the insight to understand what your team truly needs to succeed, then providing exactly that. When a practice's systems crash during peak hours, you won't just solve the problem, you'll strengthen your team's ability to handle the next crisis independently. \n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Actually Be Doing… \n\r\n\n\r\nSee the full picture: Analyze i\n patterns others overlook, identify root causes that prevent future failures, and recognize which \"urgent\" issues are truly critical \n\r\n\n\r\nElevate your team's potential: Ask the questions that help technicians discover solutions themselves, provide the exact support needed without creating dependence \n\r\n\n\r\nClear the path to success: Remove obstacles before your team encounters them, anticipate roadblocks and eliminate them proactively \n\r\n\n\r\nMake the right calls: Evaluate multiple solution approaches quickly, choose the path that balances speed, quality, and learning opportunities \n\r\n\n\r\nStrengthen through adversity: Transform every crisis into a teaching \nnt, help your team grow stronger from each challenge \n\r\n\n\r\nConnect dots others don't see: Link seemingly unrelated issues to systemic problems, recognize improvement opportunities in daily operations \n\r\n\n\r\nSupport without hovering: Know exactly when to step in and when to step back, provide scaffolding that can be removed as confidence grows \n\r\n\n\r\nBuild independence, not dependence: Guide tea\nmbers to solve increasingly complex problems on their own \n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For \n\r\n\n\r\nMust Have Experience: \n\r\n\n\r\n3+ years leading/mentoring technical support teams \n\r\n\n\r\nHealthcare IT environments or regulated industries experience \n\r\n\n\r\nEnterprise-level support experience \n\r\n\n\r\nHigh-pressure technical escalations handling \n\r\n\n\r\nHIPAA compliance or similar regulatory frameworks \n\r\n\n\r\nProcess improvement and team capability building track record \n\r\n\n\r\nWho you are: \n\r\n\n\r\nSomeone who reads between the lines; you notice what's not being said in support tickets, spot patterns in seemingly random issues, and understand the real problem behind the stated problem \n\r\n\n\r\nA natural talent spotter who sees capabilities in people they don't yet recognize in themselves and knows exactly how to nurture that potential \n\r\n\n\r\nInstinctively analytical with the ability to quickly assess complex situations, weigh multiple factors simultaneously, and make sound decisions with incomplete information \n\r\n\n\r\nA catalyst for growth who gets genuine satisfaction from watching tea\nmbers solve problems they couldn't handle last month \n\r\n\n\r\nComfortable with ambiguity because you trust your judgment to find clarity in confusion and help others do the same \n\r\n\n\r\nSomeone who asks powerful questions rather than giving immediate answers, knowing that discovery beats instruction every time \n\r\n\n\r\nEnergized by helping others succeed; your best days are when a tea\nmber has a breakthrough or handles a crisis without your help \n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer \n\r\n\n\r\nMeaningful impact: Shape how healthcare technology supports patient care while developing the next generation of healthcare IT professionals \n\r\n\n\r\nGrowth trajectory: Clear pathways to senior technical leadership, with ongoing training in emerging healthcare technologies and AI-powered solutions \n\r\n\n\r\nInnovation environment: Work with cutting-edge healthcare IT, from AI appointment systems to advanced EHR integrations \n\r\n\n\r\nTeam excellence: Join passionate professionals who thrive under pressure and take pride in making the impossible routine \n\r\n\n\r\nCompetitive package: Reflecting your expertise and the critical nature of healthcare IT support \n\r\n\n\r\nPurpose-driven culture: Where every ticket resolved means a healthcare worker can focus on patients, not technology \n\r\n\n\r\nJoin Our Mission \n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone who understands that true leadership isn't about having all the answers, it's about knowing which questions to ask and when to ask them. Someone who finds fulfilment not in being the hero, but in creating an environment where heroes emerge naturally from your team. \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're ready to use your insight to transform how healthcare IT works, your judgment to navigate critical decisions, and your ability to elevate others to build something extraordinary, let's talk about how you can help us eliminate repetitive IT tasks for 1 million healthcare workers.

This is a high-margin category with strong demand from customers who value quality gear and expert service.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll work directly with the owner during launch phase, seeing how we source products, set pricing, build marketing campaigns, and scale stores from zero to profitable. Most VAs never get this level of exposure to 7-figure e-commerce operations.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Actually Is\n\r\nYou'll manage operations (not people) for a new store during its critical launch phase. This means owning three core areas: customer experience, order fulfillment accuracy, and operational reporting.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs we scale and hire support staff in 6-12 months, you'll transition into team leadership. The systems and SOPs you build now become the foundation you'll eventually delegate.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Core Responsibilities (80% of your time)\n\r\nCustomer Service Management\n\r\n• Handle all customer interactions via\n, chat, and phone\n\r\n• Process inquiries, returns, exchanges, and disputes professionally\n\r\n• Maintain inventory accuracy in Shopify\n\r\n• Flag stock issues before they become customer problems\n\r\nDaily Operations Reporting\n\r\n• Submit end-of-shift report covering: tasks completed, blockers encountered, support needed\n\r\n• Track key metrics: orders processed, support tickets closed, errors caught\n\r\n• Identify patterns that need owner attention\n\r\n\n\r\nSecondary Responsibilities (20% of your time)\n\r\n• Maintain accurate product listings (pricing, descriptions, inventory levels)\n\r\n• Coordinate with vendors and dealer partners on orders and promotions\n\r\n• Track sales performance and identify conversion opportunities\n\r\n• Document processes and update SOPs as workflows evolve\n\r\n• Flag customer feedback patterns that should inform product or marketing decisions\n\r\n• Support seasonal campaigns (BFCM, holiday promos)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Need to Succeed\n\r\nRequired Experience\n\r\n• 2+ years in e-commerce operations (customer service + order management + platform administration)\n\r\n• Proven Shopify experience: building listings, managing inventory, processing bulk updates\n\r\n• Experience managing multiple priorities in a fast-paced environment\n\r\nTechnical Requirements\n\r\n• Proficiency with Shopify, ClickUp, Airtable, and Google Workspace (or ability to learn quickly)\n\r\n• Reliable computer setup and 20+ Mbps internet connection\n\r\n• Backup solutions for both power and internet outages\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Style\n\r\n• Self-directed: you identify and solve problems without waiting for instructions\n\r\n• Detail-oriented: accuracy matters more than speed\n\r\n• Customer-focused: you view complaints as opportunities to improve systems\n\r\n• Process-minded: you naturally document and refine how things get done\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus\n\r\n• Knowledge of outdoor, camping, or overlanding gear\n\r\n• Previous experience in a store launch or fast-growth phase\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Schedule\n\r\n• Full-time: 40 hours per week\n\r\n• U.S. business hours: 9 PM–6 AM PHT or 10 PM–7 AM PHT (depending on Daylight Saving Time)\n\r\n• 1-hour daily break\n\r\n• Five days per week\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role Matters\n\r\n• You're not just processing orders. You're building the operational foundation for a store in a high-margin niche. During the trial period and first 6 months:\n\r\n• You'll learn how we source, price, and market products from experienced operators running multiple 7-figure stores\n\r\n• Your input shapes the SOPs and systems we'll use to scale\n\r\n• You get first consideration for team lead and category manager roles when we expand\n\r\n• You'll have direct access to the owner for mentorship on e-commerce strategy\n\r\n• This isn't a stepping-stone VA role. It's employee #1 for a store with serious growth potential.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're NOT a Fit If:\n\r\n• You need micromanagement or detailed daily task lists\n\r\n• You can't work 9 PM–7 AM PHT consistently\n\r\n• You experience frequent power/internet outages without backup solutions\n\r\n• You view this as temporary income between other opportunities\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication Instructions\n\r\nTo be considered, follow these instructions exactly:\n\r\nSubject Line:\n\r\n[Your First Name] – I Am Your New E-Commerce Operations Manager\n\r\n(Example: Kevin – I Am Your New E-commerce Assistant Store Manager)\n\r\nInclude:\n\r\nCover letter (focus on relevant e-commerce experience)\n\r\nResume\n\r\n\n\r\nAnswer These Questions (numbered format, complete sentences):\n\r\n• Describe your most relevant e-commerce operations experience: platform used, team size, daily order volume, and specific responsibilities you owned.\n\r\n• What specific Shopify tasks have you performed? (Be detailed: inventory management? Bulk uploads? App integrations? Product page optimization?)\n\r\n• Provide an example of a difficult customer service situation you handled: what was the issue, what did you do, and what was the outcome?\n\r\n• What are your current work commitments and availability?\n\r\n• Provide your internet speed (attach speed test screenshot), computer specifications, and describe your backup solutions for power and internet outages.\n\r\n• Why are you interested in this role specifically, rather than other VA positions?\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant: AI-generated or template responses will be immediately disqualified.

You will work closely with the founder to turn strategic work (case studies, workshop outputs, frameworks, content ideas) into polished, on-brand assets for both us and our clients.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor the first phase, you will work exclusively on the founder’s internal materials to learn the visual style, structure and storytelling approach. Once aligned, you will gradually begin supporting client-facing projects.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a strategy or decision-making role.
