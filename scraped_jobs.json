You’ll own our marketing creative output\n\r\nacross every channel and touchpoint.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a full-time individual role. We are not looking for agencies, studios, or contractors juggling\n\r\nmultiple clients. We want one person who is fully committed to Bandou and treats this brand like their\n\r\nown.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe right person sees what needs to be done, plans ahead, flags deadlines before they’re missed,\n\r\nand brings ideas to the table unprompted. If you thrive in structured environments that you help\n\r\ncreate, this is for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Own:\n\r\n\n\r\nVisual Design & Creative Execution\n\r\nYou’ll be the creative engine behind our marketing visuals. This includes some ad creatives,\n\r\ncampaign assets, homepage banners, product imagery, pitch decks for retail and wholesale\n\r\npartners, and any other visual touchpoint the brand needs. You produce work that is both visually\n\r\nstrong and commercially effective - you understand that great design in marketing exists to drive\n\r\naction, not just to look good.\n\r\nYou’re highly proficient with Adobe Creative Suite and comfortable working with .ai files.

You manage seasonal campaigns, product\n\r\nlaunches, and ad hoc needs without needing to be reminded or followed up with.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen a campaign is on the horizon, you’re already thinking about what assets are needed, what the\n\r\ncreative angle should be, and how to make it perform. You bring that thinking to the founder, not the\n\r\nother way around.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We’re Looking For:\n\r\n? Proven graphic design skills with a portfolio that shows real marketing work - ad creatives,\n\r\ncampaign assets, promotional materials (not just logos and branding)\n\r\n? Proficient in Adobe Creative Suite, including working with .ai files\n\r\n? Exceptional organizational skills - you manage your own deadlines, maintain a clear\n\r\ncalendar, and never drop the ball\n\r\n? Proactive by nature - you identify what needs to be done and do it, without waiting to be\n\r\nasked\n\r\n? Commercially minded - you understand what drives clicks and conversions, not just what\n\r\nlooks nice\n\r\n? Perfect written English - you’ll be communicating professionally with external partners and\n\r\nstakeholders\n\r\n? Experience at a digital marketing or creative agency is a strong plus\n\r\n? Familiarity with Shopify, Figma, or similar tools is a bonus\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer:\n\r\n? $3,000 USD monthly ($1,500 USD paid bi-weekly)\n\r\n? 100% remote\n\r\n? Single brand focus\n\r\n? Work on fun, globally recognized children’s brands\n\r\n? A small, no-BS team that trusts you to own your work\n\r\n? Real growth opportunity as the brand scales\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\n\n\r\nSend your portfolio and a short note (3–5 sentences) on why this role is a fit to\n\r\n\n last thing: start your\n subject line with “Pew Pew ????” - it’s how we’ll know you\n\r\nactually read this.

This role is for someone who truly understands how to architect, build, and scale advanced GHL systems for real marketing environments. We are not interested in hiring agencies, white-label teams, or outsourced firms. This position is for an individual expert with a proven track record.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is fully remote, but candidates must be available to work consistently during AV / EST business hours. Excellent, near-perfect English communication skills are required, both written and spoken, as you will be collaborating closely with leadership and internal teams on system design and execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs our GoHighLevel Build Expert, you will be responsible for turning marketing strategy into fully functional, scalable GHL systems. This includes designing complete account structures, building funnels and websites inside GoHighLevel, creating and executing advanced workflow automation plans, and implementing API-driven integrations. You will be expected to think in systems, not just features, and to plan automation logic thoroughly before building. Clean structure, clear logic, and long-term maintainability are critical in this role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will regularly build high-converting websites, funnels, and landing pages directly inside GoHighLevel, including forms, surveys, calendars, booking logic, membership areas, and payment flows using Stripe. You should understand how these components work together to support lead generation, appointment setting, onboarding, and fulfillment for marketing clients. Speed, mobile responsiveness, and user experience are expected standards, not afterthoughts.\n\r\n\n\r\nA major part of this role involves workflow strategy and execution. You must be able to design complex automation systems that handle lead intake, pipeline movement, appointment reminders, follow-ups via SMS,\n, voi\n, and AI, internal task assignment, reactivation campaigns, and client onboarding. You will be responsible for building workflows that are efficient, reliable, and easy to debug, as well as optimizing and refactoring existing automations as systems evolve.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong technical capability is required. You should be comfortable working with the GoHighLevel API, webhooks, and third-party automation tools such as Zapier or Make. You will be expected to integrate GoHighLevel with external tools including CRMs, payment processors,\n platforms, membership systems, and tracking tools, while understanding data flow, API limits, and error handling. This is not a surface-level integration role; deep understanding is required.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work closely with one of the original GoHighLevel trainers, as well as with internal marketing strategists and operators. Clear communication, ownership of your work, and the ability to execute without hand-holding are essential. This role requires someone who can take direction, apply strategic thinking, and deliver high-quality builds consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo be considered, you must have advanced, real-world GoHighLevel experience with verifiable examples of complex systems you have built. You must be able to demonstrate a strong track record, provide references, and clearly explain how you have handled workflow complexity, integrations, and scalable system design in past roles. This position is not suitable for beginners, template-only builders, or anyone still learning GoHighLevel fundamentals.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn return, this role offers long-term stability, direct access to top-tier GHL expertise, and the opportunity to build serious systems that directly impact client success and company growth. If you are a true GoHighLevel expert who takes pride in clean builds, smart automation, and scalable architecture, we want to hear from you.                ",

We manage multiple products, multiple funnels, and multiple countries — all at once.\n\r\nWe're currently in aggressive expansion mode with a 3-year objective of $100M/year in revenue. We need ONE strategic Media Buyer to join the core team and grow with us long-term. \n\r\nThis is NOT a \"check ROAS and increase budgets\" role since it's easily automated with AI.

WHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\n\n\r\nLaunch, monitor, and optimize Meta ad campaigns across 12+ European markets for multiple products\n\r\nMake kill / scale / reborn decisions based on ROAS, spend data, CPM context, and your own judgment\n\r\nManage budgets across COD and dropshipping models — each has different KPIs and constraints\n\r\nProduce daily performance reports with clear hypotheses explaining WHY results look the way they do\n\r\nCheck stock levels before scaling any COD market — in COD, you maximize ROI on inventory, not just ROI on spend\n\r\nIdentify patterns across markets and flag issues beyond ads: broken pages, bad translations, weak offers, stock shortages\n\r\nUnderstand the full funnel: offers, advertorials, landing pages, product pages, checkout flows\n\r\nOptimize spend allocation — push budget where the returns are highest, cut fast where they're not\n\r\n\n\r\n????
